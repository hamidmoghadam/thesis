It’s related to an “active measure” that was pushed by RT, Sputnik and Trump, that the election would be rigged. It wasn’t, and calling it “hacked” makes it sound like it was. It implies that votes in the machines were changed. That’s not the issue, and it’s not helpful in understanding what happened.The issue here is not simply that Russia wanted Trump to win. That’s obvious, but no surprise or even a big deal. Putin has long despised Hillary Clinton, and she has been tough on Russia for years.There are three serious Trump/Russia problems that need our focus. Each one of them is an impeachable offense on its own. Even before taking them all together, we are looking at scandals that eclipse any seen from any previous presidency.Problem 1: The “hack” itself.There was in fact a hack by agents for Russia, as we all know, to steal DNC and RNC emails. If Trump received those files, which appears to be the case, this is a violation of the law.First of all, accepting material help or donations from foreign nationals in a political campaign is illegal. We know Trump illegally fundraised internationally during campaign. Foreign officials routinely complained about receiving the requests and published them online.Second, stealing files for political use, as Nixon learned, is also illegal. Trump’s campaign clearly coordinated with Russian agents such as Guccifer 2.0–now known to be several Russians, Wikileaks–Assange has long sought to create a “counter” to US power, and others, in leaking the DNC emails (the hacked RNC emails have remained hidden). Trump officials knew what these groups had before they released them, when they were coming out, and alerted media to their contents every time. While this is similar to the Watergate scandal, this is actually much, much worse. His supporters are trying to claim that this release of documents by Russia proves nothing, but the campaign’s direct involvement in their release, and Trump’s public “sarcastic” request for the hack is criminal.Problem 2: The payoff to Russia.We don’t know exactly what Russia is getting in return for their efforts. We do know of two public benefits already: Hillary Clinton was a strong Putin critic, and Trump is an unabashed Putin fan, so naturally Putin preferred candidate Trump. Russia was also keenly interested in sowing doubt about the fairness of democratic elections, especially in the US, and has succeeded wildly in that effort. As noted above, Trump was calling the election “rigged,” just like Russian media, well before the vote took place.We also know that Team Trump’s ONLY input in the Republican Platform before the GOP conventions was to change the language regarding Russia and the Ukraine. The Trump campaign revised the language in the platform to remove the pledge to arm the Ukraine in order to protect it from Russia. Cruz supporters and other Republicans had previously fought to increase Russian sanctions due to their moves against the Ukraine, but Trump’s team gutted that part.We also know that Trump’s National Security Advisor, Gen. Michael Flynn, was a paid foreign agent for Turkey, and was also receiving payments from Russia. The Foreign Agent Registration Act (originally an anti-Nazi measure) has very rigorous disclosure requirements that Flynn and the Trump campaign completely ignored.We also know that Paul Manafort, campaign manager at the time, and longtime Trump friend (and neighbor in Trump Tower), was a paid lobbyist for the pro-Russian Ukrainian president for over a decade. In fact, the whole “lock her up” chant that was–and is still–so popular at Trump rallies was first used by Manafort in Yanukovich’s campaign. (And Yulia Tymoshenko was indeed locked up.)Putin has already gotten an excellent deal from the Trump Administration in return for his support, but we do not know what is still remaining. As Putin cracks down on dissent across Russia, and his language mirrors that of Trump in terms of “paid protesters,” we can only guess what their collaboration might mean for American democracy. As they both push for “traditional” anti-gay, anti-woman, anti-brown-immigrant nominally-Christian white supremacy to consolidate their power, their place in the global fascist movement is becoming more and more prominent.Problem 3: The payoff to Trump.Donald Trump has been trying to do business in the Soviet Union and Russia since at least 1987, and by many accounts has been groomed as an asset for decades. The possibilities for mind-boggling profits for the well-connected are tremendous in Russia since the Soviet Union’s fall. For associates of Putin, as long as they stay in line, this has been the norm.We have no reason to assume that Trump isn’t shifting US policy in Russia’s favor in exchange for money or deals. In fact, with his Russian government and Russian mob ties, it seems more likely than not. A highly-connected American asset could make millions, if not billions, of dollars from Russian deals.We know that many operations of the Russian mafia in New York operated out of Trump Tower; this is why the FBI was monitoring the building and apparently picked up some of Trump’s communications. While Trump claimed that he himself was “tapped,” the FBI has stated that some of his communications might have been picked up in their surveillance of known criminals.This isn’t much different than how Lindsey Graham, Jared Kushner and other Trump associates’ conversations were picked up while speaking with the Russian Ambassador, who was being surveilled as a suspected spy recruiter.The closeness of Trump’s Administration to Putin and Russian associates, his business ties to wealthy Russian oligarchs, Russian banks and Russian mob leaders, his placement of family loyalists Jared Kushner and his daughter Ivanka into the White House itself, all appear to be a setup for Trump Organization profits. As Republicans in Congress continue to rebuff calls for Trump’s financial and tax information, it is difficult to imagine that Donald Trump isn’t selling our country’s policy to line his own pockets.In fact, based on everything we have known about Trump for the past thirty years, it is extremely likely.(you can watch the hearings again here) Update: I may have spoken too soon. The issue, in my view, was always that Russia’s interference in the election is where the illegality lies. I still think that’s the case, and it’s where investigators seem to be focusing.But now it seems that the first paragraphs of this post may be incorrect.Problem 4. The Justice Department has confirmed that there are 90 pages of swing state machine flaws from November, in a FOIA answer to navo-us.org. In addition, we know of Russian hacking into state elections boards before the election occurred, but it’s not clear how this might have been used. Again, this may all be more of the active measures designed to reduce our confidence in democracy, but it’s hard to know without all the facts. It still seems that the likely sale of US policy in order to line our current President’s pockets is the more pressing issue. Trump’s latest dealings with Russia (and involving Syria) are seeming more and more like he vastly underestimated the difficulties that would be created by cozying up to them.He has no appreciation for the political maneuvering of countries, or the long term goals of nations for territory or alliances. As with anything else, he’s fixated on the short-term deal, and–as in business–will temporarily ally with anyone, and screw over anyone else–to achieve a little profit." False text

We can try. I have a lot of conservative family that aren’t racist at heart, and a lot who are. Still others who support racist politicians and policies while thinking of themselves as kind-hearted and open-minded. Kind and open is generally not how the rest of us see them. It’s simple: If your political focus is on preserving a system designed to be unfair, and that’s what conservatism is, it’s likely you support its unfairness. If your primary goal is to keep your own privileges, you’re doing so at the expense of other people. Some conservatives, like Rep. Steve King for example, are almost honest about this & admit to it. As King infamously tweeted, he doesn’t want a society made of “other people’s babies.” He denied he was being racist, even as he was directly quoting a white supremacist slogan, because he claims there’s logic in his statement. Sorry, but everyone has a degree of internal logic in their thinking. That doesn’t mean it makes sense, and doesn’t mean it isn’t vile. I’m often struck by how many of King’s peers & supporters can make unabashedly white supremacist comments then get offended when called out for being racist. As if being called that is worse than actually saying damaging things. Similarly, and even more often, when politicians or opinion-writers are called out for promoting racist policies, they object that we’ve gone beyond the bounds of polite discourse, when it’s their policies themselves that long ago went beyond civility. In the age of Trump, now that public racism has become normalized again, pointing it out needs to be normalized, too. We’ve reached a bizarre point where Americans and our media are once again more comfortable with racist speech than with criticism of it.  In that light, when people–and political parties–support policies that clearly hurt groups at the margins, we have to assume that is their intent. And we have to say so. If conservatives are not racist, or bigoted, or misogynist, then the burden is on them to prove it.  Unless of course, they don’t mind the assumption. Because their policies do not readily support other conclusions, and this country has too far to go for equality for us to allow such casual movement away from it." True text

If the donors believe the sick or injured person ate too much sugar as a child, or grew up black, they can withhold funds and hope the person dies. This shit is really simple. When people don’t believe in taxes being needed to benefit all of society, they don’t believe in a broader community. Frankly, they are denying the very idea of a nation, all to deny specific people a nation’s benefits. Ethnonationalism is not a way to build an actual nation. Its purpose is to splinter nations into isolated pockets. It is the destruction the Republican Party is attempting to force onto the rest of us.  You make this attack assuming that you have the moral high ground. You don’t. I will attempt to make this very simple. As kids we are all taught that stealing is wrong. See the definition of steal here: Definition of steal stoleplay\ˈstōl\; stolenplay\ˈstō-lən\; stealing intransitive verb 1:  to take the property of another wrongfully and especially as a habitual or regular practice 2:  to come or go secretly, unobtrusively, gradually, or unexpectedly 3:  to steal or attempt to steal a base https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/steal This is one basic thing that we all learn. If you stole my money I could see you punished by law. What makes you think that having the government steal from me is different from you robbing me at gunpoint? Don’t mistake my disdain for thieves as a statement that I don’t care about those who suffer. I gladly donate to charities that I feel to be good organizations.  I am, however, deadset against the government acting as a charity. The government already can’t handle what they have on their plate. I cannot understand why people insist that we charge them with more responsibility. I get that you wish for all of the “greedy bastards” to pay their fair share. The fact is that most of them do. This idea that these big corporation heads are greedy assholes generally stems from people’s frustration with the government mishandling the money that they steal from us. Crowd funding is a beautiful thing. This allows an individual to make there own choice of who they trust their hard earned money with. By making this more readily available it could eliminate a lot of the riff-raff that take advantage of our current system. This frees up the funds to allow more efficient charity. With our current systems every dollar the government steals for “charity”. A very significant portion of the money stolen from us is lost immediately due to processing, leechers, and over spending. Is this the best way to do things? Not only is our current system both extremely immoral; it is also one of the least efficient methods of actually helping people. With crowd funding at least we know exactly where are money is going.  This is both hilarious and sad.First, taxation is not theft. It can be, for example if the government is a dictatorship, or there is no representation. That’s not the case here, and no sane person thinks it is.Crowdfunding has its place, but the conservative argument against public healthcare has been that everyone should provide for themselves. Adding in “but if they can’t they should get online and beg for money and I’ll support them” reveals the blatant lie in that entire argument.I can’t tell if you’re honestly proposing a system where “generous” people scroll through medical profiles looking for people they trust their hard-earned money with, but it sounds like you may be. “Ooh she’s hot, here’s ten bucks. Ugh, diabetes, just die already,” swipe, swipe again, is what you’re describing. (And the most generous people in this country are, and have always been, the poorest. Unless you’re talking about things like slapping names on university buildings–that’s a more expensive charity that our most wealthy really enjoy. Lots of exceptions in a big country, but that’s what the data says.)It could be like a dating app that comes pre-loaded on all phones, but most people turn off the alerts because it’s annoying to look at. The popular can promote their profiles on other media, and if your social skills are bad you can lose your home and die. Sort of like now, but with the bonus direct message of “no one likes you” on your deathbed. (I see some dystopian short fiction coming on here…)The only people who don’t see taxation as a form of organized and large-scale crowdfunding are people who want to limit their taxes from assisting specific ethnic and religious groups. That’s a fact, even if it does make some people uncomfortable to admit.But I strongly agree on one thing: our current system is extremely immoral and is one of the least efficient ways of actually helping people. It’s why every other developed nation in the world has some form of universal healthcare. It’s cheaper and more effective than our shitshow. But then not all other developed nations have our segregated social history, or mainstream politics as far to the right as ours. We still have a sizable part of our population wishing that about a third of the country would just die already. If you’re legit telling me you want to pick & choose who deserves to live or not, you must be one of them. Embrace it, you’ll feel better, and your arguments will make more sense." False text

In fact, a non-racist conservative will have a difficult time reconciling their own positions in any society built on white supremacy and segregation, especially when those things aren’t even behind us.  It’s difficult to imagine racial and economic views as remaining separate, unless racial discrimination or injustice can be hidden from view. That is becoming more difficult all the time, and this result–the alignment of conservatism and racism–was inevitable here. It may actually be the only way we can move to a more progressive and open future." True link

Whites in both the north and south agreed to reconcile at the expense of black Americans and their supporters. This wasn’t subtle, either.  Powerful mayors and governors in the northern states made a big show of their support of southern whites in their bid to regain total control of their states. Do not forget the Klan monument at Stone Mountain Georgia was dedicated with much fanfare by the mayor of New York City.  If there is anything that the hagiography of Lee was intended to achieve, it was primarily to assuage the guilt of those whites and their descendants, a way of telling themselves that issues of human bondage were complex, that it was possible to be a violent slaver and a Christian gentleman. It’s not, and that lie continues to poison our entire country. It’s long past time to admit it." True link

And so Trump’s enablers, the real source of his power and political longevity, will not be feeling the pressure necessary for them to discard the buffoon. They still rely on his popularity with their bases more than he relies on them. They are caught in the Totentanz they devised and will stay on the floor however much damage they cause the country."

This statement sounds like the direct result of internalized both-siderism. You don’t get to pick and choose which parts of the ruling party’s dogma you think is appropriate. They believe it, wholly, and if we (and especially our media) avoid pointing out the extreme and offensive nature of right-wing politicians’ beliefs, these are the laws we have to expect. The parties may not be exactly what anyone wants, but they aren’t close together on issues, they are radically different. As such, political coverage shouldn’t consist entirely of court intrigue, it should tell us the impacts of candidates’ proposals instead.

At the conclusion of the war, Mississippi was one of two Southern states that suddenly had a majority-black citizenry. As a result, the people there elected impressively integrated governments statewide, and were the first to send an African-American senator to Washington. The US troops stationed throughout the South to keep the peace during Reconstruction were under constant pressure by former Confederates and race terrorists. Public pressure from the North eventually led them to be called home, ending Reconstruction and allowing white supremacists to regain control. In Mississippi, black and liberal office holders were forcibly removed from the statehouse, and the old white power structure regained control. The state flag was changed to commemorate the occasion and was raised to serve as a warning to blacks and their allies that they were not welcome in elected office or in voting booths, and that any attempt to exercise their rights would be met with violence or death. The flag’s meaning has never changed." True link
