They want to hear from self-advocates about how we view autism, how it impacts our lives, our thoughts on medication for co-occurring conditions, and what we think are - and are not - appropriate goals for autism services and supports. We have heard from the FDA that they are mostly hearing from family members so far. ASAN is submitting comments, but we need to make sure they hear from as many self-advocates as possible. Let them know what you think!There are a lot of different ways to give them your feedback:Register for the meeting (in Silver Spring, MD) and participate in the audience discussionSign up to participate via webcast and submit questions and comments during the meetingSubmit a comment online from now through July 5th" True text

But some of them still want a pass on excluding disabled people. Right now, Members of Congress and corporate lobbyists are pushing H.R. 620, a bill that weakens the ADA. We need to push back: contact your Members of Congress and let them know that our civil rights don’t come with a waiting period.The House could vote on H.R. 620 as soon as this week. This bill:Lets  businesses avoid fixing access barriers for up to four months after  receiving a complaint – even though the ADA’s access requirements are  already 27 years old! Ignores the fact that the ADA is the most important civil rights law for people with disabilities. Ignores the extensive, free educational resources already available today to any business on how to comply with the law. You can find contact information for your two Senators, and your Congressional Representative, at contactingcongress.org. Here’s a script you can use to call, write, or email: Script for contacting your U.S. Representative: My name is [Name], and I live in [your town]. I’m [calling/writing] to ask Representative [Name] to  vote NO on H.R. 620. People with disabilities need to be able to shop  for groceries, stay at hotels, and use other public accommodations. It  has been 27 years since the Americans with Disabilities Act. Disabled  people in our district have waited too long for access – and businesses  have had plenty of time to provide it. Please protect the ADA and vote  NO on H.R. 620. Script for contacting your U.S. Senator: My name is [Name], and I live in [your town]. I’m [calling/writing] to ask Senator [Name] to  oppose a Senate version of H.R. 620. People with disabilities need to  be able to shop for groceries, stay at hotels, and use other public  accommodations. It has been 27 years since the Americans with  Disabilities Act. Disabled people in our state have waited too long for  access – and businesses have had plenty of time to provide it. Please  protect the ADA and vote NO on any Senate version of H.R. 620. We cannot allow Congress to start chipping away at the ADA. Make sure your Members of Congress know that you expect them to stand up for disability rights. Nothing about us, without us!

If an image description is included for a gif, picture, or screenshot then the words are already included in the body of the post and it is more likely to be screened by the software for people who need it.

Meaning he can now effectively communicate his needs with anyone! So I’ll be posting a bit about that later. I know some of you are autistic too or have an autistic loved one, nonverbal or not, and would find that kind of thing helpful. As an aside: PECS systems can cost hundreds of dollars, but are actually very simple to make. So I may get the materials and make a step-by-step guide about making your own at home if any of you are interested in that. When it comes down to it, they can be made for around $10 total. Which is much better than what, say, Amazon would offer something similar for ($99, with categorized icon packs being $15 a piece separately).Making your own is especially wise considering the uncertainty of it all. If you’re building one for a child, they may take to sign language over PECS and then you’d only be out $10 instead of $100. Or maybe they take to PECS and become verbal in a year or two, you’d rather have a $10 paper weight over a $100 paper weight, right? Furthermore, if you’re starting PECS with a young child, no matter what the icons and the boards are made up of, they’re going to need frequent replacing. Especially the icons as they get lost or bent/broken/swallowed. That’s just the nature of young children. Especially ones with flappy hands. :)Depending on where you live, some schools and ASD programs will provide a PECS book for your child but having a back-up is ideal. You could keep the main board in the house, with the child, and keep a second home-made PECS book in the car in case the original ever gets forgotten during a rushed morning, because let’s face it – we’re all chronically late for things.Anyway, keep an eye out for those posts. The first will come later on today. The other will take longer. I’ll have to make it to the store first and all. Even for a kid who speaks, you may still find PECS cards useful!  My younger kid (who was/is verbal*) felt much more comfortable when a future activity was laid out in PECS cards.  It helped him form and remember a mental image in his mind of what was coming up. He mostly needed this for novel activities (e.g., trip to a new place) but enjoyed having pictures on checklists for routines (e.g., the go-to-bed steps). *From time to time he will struggle to recall a word, especially in stressful/crowded situations, and having PECS icons around have helped then too.
