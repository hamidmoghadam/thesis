Meetings between high-level representatives of rival capitalist nations often reinforce détente and facilitate co-operation. The very worst excesses of Cold War posturing were curbed by direct diplomatic interactions between state actors; it’s highly possible, for example, that a nuclear exchange would have taken place in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis if the personal intervention of Bobby Kennedy had not made the US’s aggressive policy more comprehensible and predictable to Kremlin bureaucrats. There are many things that Trump should be brutally criticised for - not least for seconding his unelected, unaccountable daughter to sit in for him at other high-level meetings during the week - but holding cursory meetings with rival state leaders is not one of them.  We have to assume that, had Hillary won in November, the stonewalling pressure being heaped on the Trump administration by the liberal media and the Democrats in this case would be official White House policy. We’re confronted with the awkward truth that a Democratic victory would have made the world a more unstable and unpredictable place." True text

Yet those survivors as yet unknown to authorities, who have taken routes less legal than those pursued by Mr. Alhajali, will be rounded up and set back to war zones, persecution and poverty - simply by dint of being too poor or too desperate to fulfil draconian immigration criteria. It seems arbitrary in the extreme to reserve such words as ‘terrorist’ purely for the Assad regime and ISIL, when our own government is hell-bent on offering up refugees for their charnel houses. The cruelty of this government is so uniform that it is in danger of becoming mundane, normalised by endless inhuman grotesques. Yet successive governments dating back to the Blair era have been complicit in designing the architecture of oppression which has resulted in poor migrant workers being forced to live and die in flammable death traps. Punitive measures such as those announced by the government today - which directly contradict earlier promises of an amnesty - demand a modern-day Sanctuary Movement to provide succour to those most deeply betrayed by Western liberal values.

It’s becoming rapidly clear that a disaster the scale of Grenfell was not just a preventable tragedy, but the inevitable and certain outcome of an unspoken cost-cutting policy enacted by both publically-owned and private landlords which prioritised rent gouging over the most basic tenant safety. Frankly, revolutions have started over much, much lesser crimes. The only rational response to these revelations, and the desperate scrambling cover-up undertaken by the government’s official inquiries - staffed as they are by the very individuals who have attempted to write this tacit policy into explicit deregulation - is a national rent strike of poor and vulnerable tenants, backed to the hilt by the organisations of the working-class.

One area which often goes consistently unexamined is that of public justice. It’s so easy, and satisfying, to perceive and injustice and say ‘x should be locked up’. Why is it that we demand the use of punitive capitalist state sanctions against individuals, which themselves have been practised against our class in the most prejudicial manner for centuries? Does it satisfy us to turn those same oppressive institutions against those who have done us harm? Scratching at a burrowing tick might well feel good, but it doesn’t extract the parasite. It’s an uncomfortable truth that locking people up often resolves little: intractable social problems cannot be solved by changing the guard, throwing the disgraced former officials in prison, and leaving underlying architectures of oppression untouched. Justice must be seen to be done, but examples and public spectacles - often carried out as desperate rearguard actions by disgraced authorities - cannot be mistaken for social revolution. We must address the fundamental conservatism and reaction at the heart of retributive justice, in pursuit of a new, transformative social justice." True text

On top, in order to fend off a government-ending Labour amendment to the Queen’s Speech, she was forced to promise a relaxation in laws governing abortion in Northern Ireland, where it remains illegal: Ulsterwomen seeking abortions in England will no longer be charged, and would receive free treatment.So we have the bizarre spectacle of the architects of austerity willingly shredding the foundations of their anti-working-class ideology, in coalition with a far-right Christian party which has already been forced to sell a lynchpin of its medieval misogyny down the river for a sniff of power.The fact is, the mass of working-class Brits, fed up to the back teeth with decades of neoliberal decline and managed working-class social collapse, are already dictating the ruling-class’s agenda."

But retribution is only part of justice. There is no doubt that the families of those who lost their lives deserve the satisfaction of seeing those responsible brought to book. But there’s an unmissable irony in the very same punitive institutions of state claiming to be champions of justice for the 96, when they have spent the better part of thirty years obfuscating and prevaricating so as to throw all public accountability into the long grass. Real justice for the 96 will require fundamental change. It will require addressing the operation of class power in South Yorkshire and elsewhere in the country: how a police force was paramilitarised during the Miners Strike, and given its own fiefdom by a rabidly anti-working-class Tory government; how high-ranking officers gave orders to tamper with evidence and to massage witness statements; how the shady nexus between organised crime, the police and the press facilitated the vilification of the victims of the Disaster; how national politicians, both Labour and Tory, created a deeply classist narrative to prevent the true shame from becoming public currency.

Like Carson, Arlene Phillips and the DUP have scrambled for the political patronage of the Tories: in 1912, that patronage took the form of carte-blanche political support and guns; in 2017, it takes the form of an effective end to austerity in Northern Ireland. A century ago, Carson’s limitless extremism formed the lynchpin of a strategy to force the embattled Liberal government from power over the issue of Home Rule - autonomous rule for Ireland. Nowadays, the Tory government has, quite literally, bought the ten DUP MPs in order to achieve nothing beyond simply clinging onto political power. But Carson’s dream of retaining a united Ireland within the British Empire was ultimately crushed - the outbreak of the Great War froze the Home Rule Crisis in its tracks, and the revolutionary uprisings in Ireland and across Europe which brought war to a close would ultimately make Irish independence an inevitability. Carson felt the deepest betrayal in the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 - which was overwhelmingly supported by the same Tory MPs who, only a few years before, had rapturously applauded Carson’s determination to oppose Home Rule by force of arms.The Conservative Party, as a party of the landed gentry and the financial aristocracy, remains essentially unchanged in its approach to politics: it willingly indulges the most rabid forms of extremism, but will preserve its own self-interest at all costs. This is the most toxic cocktail, forming both a dry rag and a bottle of high-proof spirit.

Neither idea - as articulated within the 'official’ forums of public debate in press, media and Parliament - was a comprehensive vision of social transformation. Both became immediately and inevitably subsumed into the contentless war-of-position between neoliberal elites who fundamentally agree with one another on the tenets of post-Thatcher free-market capitalism: the concrete realities of how European states relate to one another and their citizens politically and economically became hopelessly lost, buried amidst debate undertaken on duplicitous premises.  Therefore, it was left up to ordinary folk themselves to project symbolic social content onto these categories which had been hollowed out by meaningless public discussion. On the one hand, in the minds of young, and relatively affluent voters, 'Remain’ became the symbol of anti-racism, cosmopolitanism, and global community; whilst for precarious, generally older workers, 'Leave’ became a nostalgic shibboleth associated with encompassing public welfare institutions, state-managed economics and a hazy, monocultural notion of social empowerment. Given this poorly defined, culturally relative plane of public debate, it’s no wonder at all that class allegiances shattered, with new political cleavages opening up between generations, party loyalties and cultural outlooks. The only way to comprehend, and ultimately to navigate the Brexit from the perspective of working-class interests is to nail it firmly to the deck. We must fill those empty social containers. What does Brexit have to look like to guarantee our collective interests? Nationalisation of the large financial institutions, the refoundation of the British welfare state, the unilateral withdrawal from NATO and nuclear disarmament, a strongly anti-racist migration policy.  Brexit is not a cultural quest for self-knowledge. It is a political question about power, resources and which class wields them." True text

No event in Irish history more clearly illustrates the two Irelands, North and South, working-class and ruling-class, socialist and nationalist, which were laid bare for all to see during the tumult of the First World War. Empire, class, religion and race all collided in the pressure-cooker of an occupied colonial territory desperate to be free of its oppressorsI want to give the 1916 Easter Rising the analysis that it deserves, and I think that fully understanding the uprising requires a deep understanding of Irish working-class history – as such, I’m juggling a large volume of material for this episode. It’s likely that I’ll end up splitting the episode into two parts, so that I don’t dump four hundred years of class struggle on you all in one go.If you can’t wait for the next episode, then have a listen to the first two episodes - the best way to do that is to subscribe on iTunes, Pocket Casts, Stitcher and most other podcatcher services.
