Then after 7 years of bragging he accidentally shows up on karaoke night and everybody keeps telling him he has to go up and sing so he does and he is awful, doesn’t know the words, off-key and he quits halfway through the song and leaves. Then he shows up at work the next day like nothing happened and says that he can totally crush it on “Hot For Teacher” by Van Halen." False text

But it seems House Speaker Paul Ryan wanted to save it in order to make a splash when Donald Trump signs it this week, because stigmatizing jobless workers is always worth more attention in his book.  xAnother one heads to President TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs desk. This legislation allows states to have drug testing to receive federal unemployment benefits. http://pic.twitter.com/cFnvdeQqX1— Paul Ryan (@SpeakerRyan) March 19, 2017  There are so many problems with this. As a letter from nearly 50 civil rights, criminal justice, faith, and labor organizations points out, there are already measures in place to prevent drug users from getting unemployment benefits—for instance, someone whose firing had anything to do with drug use is not eligible for benefits in “virtually all” states, and six states “have passed legislation equating a failed or refused pre-employment drug screen with refusing suitable work.” Drug testing unemployment applicants is also a waste of public money, since repeated experience has shown that very few people will be screened out by the tests.  The letter details two other serious problems.   from Daily Kos http://ift.tt/2ne5ZEC via IFTTT" True text

In just a few months all this activism comes to a head and Bernie Sanders has a very real chance at winning.  Bernie Sanders is already winning in two of these early states and by much wider margins than previous Democratic challenger candidates. This can become a real victory, it really can.  Unfortunately though there is a huge obstacle to overcome, a lot of Bernie Sanders supporters are young voters who consistently fail to show up to the polls come election day.  If young people turn out to vote though at rates far above 13%, even as low as 50%, that would be MASSIVE. That would fundamentally change how our government responds to the needs of young people. It is a tall order, but it isn’t that hard. Registering to vote isn’t that difficult and there is no reason that anyone should not be registered by the deadline. It needs to be done soon, but there is still plenty of time.  Okay actually, for some people there isn’t much time left. NEW YORKERS REGISTER TO VOTE NOW! Everyone else, there is some breathing room, but get on it. Below is a link to all the paper work you need, from there it is up to you. Share with your friends and family, help them register, help them get to the polls, and lets get Bernie Sanders elected president.

BLUE STATES: Anyone of any party affiliation can vote for Bernie Sanders in the Democratic Primary. RED STATES: Red states are closed primaries, meaning you MUST BE A REGISTERED DEMOCRAT. You need to be a Democrat if you want to vote for Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary.PURPLE STATES: Are Caucuses and the party affiliation required differs by state. GREEN STATES: Most Green states are mixed primaries, meaning INDEPENDENTS or NON-AFFILIATED voters and DEMOCRATS can vote for Bernie Sanders. You can not vote for Bernie Sanders as a registered REPUBLICAN, in one of the red states. ONE MORE THING IN THE STATE HIGHLIGHTED BELOW YOU CAN VOTE FOR BERNIE SANDERS IN THE PRIMARY ELECTION IF YOU ARE 17 AND WILL BE 18.  EVERYONE REGISTER TO VOTE. WE CAN WIN THIS THING.
