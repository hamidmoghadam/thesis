As always, when it comes to questions like “am I still ace if…”, that’s not something I can answer for you - that’s something that only you can determine for yourself. In the end, if you find that the label “ace” or “asexual” etc. is useful to you for describing yourself, then you are free to use it, and if at any time you find it’s not helpful or useful, then don’t.-Sennkestra" True text
asexualresearch 158015945917 "2017-03-05 08:04:18 GMT" http://asexualresearch.tumblr.com/post/158015945917/aphobephobe-queer-bluejay-aphobephobe-im "aphobephobe: queer-bluejay:  aphobephobe:  I’m just briefly wanting to share some research that I’ve recently found on asexuality, mental health and social issues.  Research was done by Julia Prims in 2012, discussing societal challenges as well as depression, self esteem, and self concept clarity among asexuals. This study groups participants into “asexuals who have had their orientation challenged”, “asexuals who have not had their orientationi challenged”, and (allo)”sexuals”. It can be found here.  Another study was done by Morag A. Yulea, Lori A. Brottob and Boris B. Gorzalkaa on mental health and interpersonal issues among the asexual population. They compared asexuals to both non-heterosexuals and heterosexuals. It can be found here. @asexualresearch you may be interested in these.  @ that anon who kept asking me for proof, lucky you, it just happened to pop up on my dash.  I can hit some high points for everyone who doesn’t quite have the time/energy to read these: From the first one: The majority (69.4%) of the asexuals who participated in the survey stated that they felt that their identity as an asexual had been challenged in the past.    The majority of the asexual participants claimed to have strong feelings about the portrayal of other LGBTQ issues in the media, whether they believed asexuality was an LGBTQ orientation or not. Regardless of whether they considered themselves part of the LGBTQ community, they were largely distressed when orientations such as homosexuality and bisexuality were portrayed in stereotypical or comedic way.    the longer participants identified as asexual, the less depressed they were.   There was no correlation between depression and age in the allosexual group.     *Note: I changed “sexual” to “allosexual”, as that is the current terminology. From the second one: Human asexuality is defined as a lack of sexual attraction to anyone or anything, and preliminary evidence suggests that it may best be defined as a sexual orientation.     Fifteen percent of asexual, 57% of heterosexual and 59% of nonheterosexual individuals indicated that they were in a relationship, either committed or non-committed, and these proportions differed significantly, χ2(2) = 135.18, p < 0.001; ϕc = 0.41, p < 0.001, with asexual participants being least likely to be in a relationship.     Follow-up tests indicated that asexual men were significantly more likely to report having a mood disorder than heterosexual men. There was no significant difference between asexual and nonheterosexual men.     Again, follow-up tests indicated that asexual women were more likely to report having a mood disorder than heterosexual participants. Non-heterosexual participants were significantly more likely to report a mood disorder than heterosexual participants.    More specifically, asexual men scored higher on measures of somatisation, depression and psychoticism than their non-heterosexual counterparts.     Asexual women scored higher on measures of phobic anxiety and psychoticism than heterosexual women and had scores similar to non-heterosexual women on these variables.   Notably, asexual men and women scored significantly higher on items assessing suicidality than heterosexual individuals     Further, asexual women scored higher on several interpersonal problem domains, including vindictive, cold, socially avoidant, nonassertive and exploitable personality styles than heterosexual women. Asexual men had scores indicating greater cold, socially avoidant and non-assertive personality styles compared to heterosexual men and had higher scores indicating cold personality styles than non-heterosexual men     The effect of external factors on mental health among gay men and lesbian women has been clearly established by a number of studies demonstrating that experience with stigma, prejudice and discrimination are linked with mental health status   has likened an asexual identity to that of other marginalised sexual groups and paralleled asexual and queer sexualities, as both have had histories of medicalisation and pathologisation through inclusion in the DSM.   Scherrer also noted that, like other sexual minority groups, asexual individuals have been subject to discrimination, a feature often associated with mental and physical health.   Thus, our finding of increased mental health problems among asexual individuals might be explained by the experience of discrimination because of having a non-heterosexual orientation or may perhaps even be a consequence of lacking sexual attraction within a social environment that is arguably centred on sexuality     This study provided evidence that asexuality may be associated with higher prevalence of mental health and interpersonal problems. These findings support previous research that indicates elevated levels of these mental health correlates among individuals with nonheterosexual identities.  Not exactly short, but hits what I thought were some of the most important points in these studies.

Do you know anything about this ?  (Btw I’m ace and not diognosed autistic ,though I have many autistic traits, and I hope this wasn’t offensive)Hello!My apologies for the much delayed response - I actually have a post from a year or two ago that touches on the existing research this, so hopefully this link will help: http://asexualresearch.tumblr.com/post/83243577975/how-do-you-feel-about-the-study-that-there-may-be(Followers, if you are aware of any major changes in the research landscape since then, please let me know! I’ll take a look later but it might take me a while with my currently limited library access.)The short of it is: There isn’t much formal research on the [potential] link between asexuality and autism/ASDl, but the few studies that do exist tentatively suggest there may be correlation between being autistic and identifying as asexual,   in additional to a possible link between ASD and queer identity in general. However, it’s still a weak link and more research would be needed to confirm or deny that correlation. There’s also no indication as to why that correlation might exist, if it does - is there a biological link? Are people with ASD more likely to find asexual labels useful or asexual relationship preferable for various reasons? Are ace people more likely to be introspective about their differences and decide to pursue an ASD diagnosis? Is it mostly just coincidence? We just have no idea.The 2016 Ace Community Census also asked about autism, so when that data is analyzed it may give some additional insight into the prevalence of autistic people in online ace communities (as opposed to just the prevalence of asexuality in autistic populations), but it still won’t tell us much about causality.-Sennkestra" True text

I plan to frame it as a form of secondary deviance and talk about the implication of identifying as such within social structures that consider being sexual a norm. I’ve been doing my own brief scans of papers on google scholar / academia.edu / the asexuality bibliography, as I don’t need many sources due to the short and personal nature of the paper (1.2k words max, 3-5 sources). I’m just wondering if there are any specific articles that touch on:the “outsider” aspect of asexuality (the alienation/social sanctions put in place that enforce normative ideals of all humans being sexual beings + the flipside of asexuals not understanding or being unable to fit into the dominant culture of a highly sexualized society) pertaining to asexuality as part of one’s identity (borrowing the perspective from sociological subculture studies - where secondary deviance focuses on the act of identifying as part of a subcultural group). that I can use for support in describing my experiences of behaving and self-identifying as “sexually deviant”. Thank you ever so much for your time!  Hello!A few possible recs off the top of my head:If you can access the book Asexualities: Feminist and Queer perspectives, there are a several articles that may be of interest;off the top of my head,  the ones by Ianna Hawkins Owen and Megan Milks might be useful (though several of the others may be of interest as well)Scherrer (2008) “Coming to an Asexual Identity”  discusses a lot of asexual identification, and influences a lot of later work on the subjectSloan (2015) “Ace of BDSM Clubs” may provide some interesting perspectives on the sexual deviance angleKristina Gupta (2015) “Compulsory Sexuality” is a good overview of the concept of compulsory sexuality and how it affects aces. It also contains links to most of the other recent work on that subject if it’s of interest to you.

I want to enable you to reach out year round. There are only a handful of dedicated ace websites out there.  There are plenty of spaces that haven’t been filled yet.  I know many of you have ideas, but just don’t have the money to get things off the ground. That’s where I come in.  I have the money and I want to give some of it to you. But I’m not just going to write a check for nothing.  I’m only going to back sites that look like they have real promise and fill an unmet need.  That means you need to have a realistic idea, possibly a design (hand drawn is fine), maybe even a team.  I’d even encourage you to share your ideas and collaborate openly (using the tag “#acewebsitecontest”), to get feedback on your ideas and maybe even find team members. To Enter: Send your proposal to me, either through my ask box here, or through the contact addresses at AsexualityArchive.com or WhatIsAsexuality.com, by 3PM Pacific (6 PM Eastern, 10 PM UTC) on Saturday, October 24th, 2015.   (To make sure that your proposal isn’t lost, I will acknowledge receipt.  If you don’t hear that I’ve gotten the proposal within a day or so, please try again.) Your proposal should include a summary of the site idea, an explanation of the need that this site will fill, and why you think that you or your team will be able to successfully build such a site. The Prize: Entirely at my discretion and not subject to review or appeal, I’ll give the winner a $50 gift certificate to Dreamhost.  This amount should be enough to cover a year’s worth of standard hosting there, if you use one of their easily found discount codes.  (I’ll provide one with the gift certificate.) The prize does not cover future hosting needs, tech support, or anything else.  I give you the gift certificate and my involvement is done.  It’s up to you after that.  You’re also responsible for taxes, etc. Dreamhost is the hosting provider I use, and they provide essentially unlimited storage space and bandwidth, and one free domain name registration.  They also have easy installation packages for common software, like WordPress or MediaWiki, so you do not have to be a Linux SysAdmin in order to run a site there.  It’s mostly click and go.  You will, however, have to sign up for a Dreamhost account if you win, and they might require a credit card or have geographic restrictions that I have no control over. If you don’t win, it’s not personal. If you win and the gift certificate is unused within 30 days, I might give it to someone else. And finally, I reserve the right to refuse to award a prize at all. Winning Tips: In the past, I’ve mentioned a couple of types of websites I would like to see.  Your chances are better if you’re proposing one of those… I don’t want something that already exists.  In particular, no ace dating sites and nothing that is an attempt to compete with AVEN’s forums. I want to back a winner.  Sites with a clear, realistic plan, a good idea, and a team that’s able to put it all together have a better chance of winning. The real reason I said to share your ideas and collaborate using #acewebcontest is because I want to spy on you all.  I want to see what you’re thinking, and how you work on it, outside of the formal proposal.  I might even want to get involved and ask questions or provide suggestions.  If anyone has time and enthusiasm and just needs ideas, I have a project that I want someone to implement (I can totally help out, I just don’t have the time to take lead): Your mission: Making a new asexual research oriented site to replace the now defunct asexualitystudies.org Should include both 1. A complete list of all known asexuality academic works and 2. Curated bibliographies of good works on various topics Should be run with someone with at least some familiarity with academic research and basic research statistics, esp in the social sciences (grad students are awesome!), and with a lot of familiarity with asexual academia. Should include advice for researchers  Should include news updates about conferences, calls for papers, new papers that are out, and more (asexualresearch.tumblr.com does a little bit of this, but it’s more informal and ace-oriented - I want a researcher-oriented site) Host reviews and discussions of recent papers " False text

I’d recommend reading Bogaert’s “Understanding Asexuality” (a good academic-perspective summary) or Decker’s “The Invisble Orientaion” (a good community-perspective summary) first though, because they contain more general information, whereas “Asexualities” really only has the queer/feminist reactions and not a lot of summary discussions. (Just be aware that in the last several chapters of Bogart’s book he moves away from summarizing research into discussing untested hypotheses)If you’re also going to be talking about invisibility, and the relationship to bisexuality/pansexuality, I also definitely recommend that you check out the essay “The epistemic contract of bisexual erasure” by Kenji Yoshino. It’s primarily about bisexual invisibility/erasure, but it also draws several parallels to asexual invisibility/erasure.On the bisexuality side, the SF Human Rights Commission report on Bisexual Invisibility is definitely worth a read - and though it doesn’t mention asexuals, some sections definitely also apply."

I would like your help with something. I would like to submit an abstract for a call of papers at a Women’s Studies conference. I would like to center my thesis around asexual erasure. It’s very dear to my heart as I am asexual and I feel that this is a problem. If anybody could recommend any good scholarly resources, I would be most appreciative! Feel free to submit links, reblog, anything helps! There needs to be more said on this topic. Please, this is my very first call for papers and I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed. If you could help me with my research in any way, I would be most appreciative!  Well, to start off, this post has a good intro guide with information on where to start looking for sources: http://asexualitystudies.tumblr.com/post/81564102315/help-i-need-sources-and-other-frequently-asked Also remember - university research librarians are your friend! They can introduce you to good ways of finding the existing literature on any subject.  Off the top of my head, one thing I highly recommend reading is “The Epistemic Contract of Bisexual Erasure” (especially the first half) by Kenji Yoshino - although it’s mostly about bisexual erasure, it includes some discussion of how the same forces may impact asexuality as well, and may serve as a good launching point to give you some more ideas on where you might want to go with your thesis. And in general, any literature on bisexual erasure will be a good starting point for you to build on, on top of whatever more introductory asexuality-specific papers you may choose to cite.  Also, another general research tip - if you can find papers on subjects similar to yours that you like, look through their bibliographies too! I can probably also help you find some more specific papers that might help if you can specify anything else about your thesis and what it’s focus will be - feel free to send an ask with your preferred method of contact if you’d be interested in some more in-depth advice!-Sennkestra" False text

The term ‘sexual minority group’ is usually used to refer to Lesbian Gay Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) individuals. Anecdotal and research evidence suggests that those who identify as asexual have similar poor experiences.MethodsThis work uses a systematic review and qualitative analysis of the existing interview data from self-identified asexuals, to construct features of the asexual identity. The findings will help practitioners and health professionals develop an understanding of this poorly understood construct. Ultimately this work is aimed at facilitating culturally competent care in the context of asexuality.ResultsQualitative analysis produced 3 themes, which can be used, not only to frame asexuality in a positive and normalising way, but also to provide greater understanding of asexuality, ‘romantic differences coupled with sexual indifference’, ‘validation through engagement with asexual communities’ and ‘a diversity of sub-asexual identities’.ConclusionsHaving some understanding of what it means to identify as asexual, respecting the choices made by asexuals and can markedly improve the experiences of those who embrace an asexual identity when engaging with healthcare.Relevance to clinical practiceAnecdotal evidence, taken from one of the largest asexual online forums, suggests that a number of self-identified asexuals choose not to disclose their identity to health care professionals through fear of their asexual status being pathologised, problematised, or judged. Given that asexuality is a poorly understood concept, this may be due to lack of understanding on behalf of healthcare providers. The review provides health professionals and practitioners working in clinical settings with some insights of the features of an asexual identity to facilitate culturally competent care.This article is protected by copyright.

Here, we utilized data from the 2014/15 New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study. Past research has typically used attraction-based measures; however, we asked participants to describe their sexual orientation using a self-generated, open-ended item, and 0.4% (n = 44) self-identified as asexual. We then compared self-identified asexual participants with a heterosexual reference group (n = 11,822) across a large number of demographic, psychological, and health variables. Relative to heterosexuals, self-identified asexual participants were (1) more likely to be women, and (2) substantially less likely to be cisgender, (3) in a serious romantic relationship, or (4) a parent. No deleterious mental or physical health effects were associated with asexuality when compared to heterosexuality. This study provides the first attempt at measuring self-identification as asexual in a national sample and highlights core similarities and differences between those who identify as asexual and heterosexual.I haven’t had a chance to sit down and read this yet, but the fact that they have an identity-based national probability sample already makes me interested. - Sennkestra" True link

This article uses Stephen Fry’s 1985 column on his self-imposed celibacy to explore the way these affects intersect with celibacy and asexuality understood as a sexual identity. Despite the fact that Western liberal culture perceives abjection, anxiety, and shame as problems to be solved, I argue for a queer revalorization of these aﬀects as potential basis of identity. Following Cvetkovich’s writings on trauma and Kosofsky Sedgwick’s on shame, I argue that negative aﬀects can serve as a basis of asexual self-identiﬁcation  This paper is publically available through academia.edu - no paywall!Based on the page numbers, it appears to be from a larger book/journal/anthology of some kind, but I’m still trying to track down the actual source."

This creates new opportunities and challenges for studying language change, including the language of online communities. This dissertation provides such a case study by examining the development of, and changes in, online English language asexual discourse from the second half of the 1990s until late 2013, focusing on lexical items and multi-word expressions. This dissertation combines three major research approaches—archival research, corpus research, and survey research . Using the Way Back Machine, databases of newspaper archives, and academic databases and references, historical conceptualizations of asexuality can be seen well before the emergence of asexual communities online, but I can find no evidence of asexual organizing prior to the 1990s. Largely using qualitative analysis of asexual websites, I give a historical account of the development of online asexual communities, and I argue that there have been at least two major conceptual shifts in the conceptualization of asexuality in the time period under consideration, which I call the “AVEN shift” and the “rise of intermediate categories.” I then discuss the construction of four corpora: I scrapped the largest asexual website (Asexual Visibility and Education Network [AVEN]) and a similar sized message board on a different topic as a control (Non-asexual corpus). I subdivided the AVEN data into two sub-corpora, based on the sub-forum topics. Most subforums are in the AVEN-core corpus. Some (e.g. “Just For Fun” or “Off-A”) are mostly about topics other than asexuality, and were grouped as the AVEN-other Corpus. In addition, I scraped several asexual blogs and asexual communities other than AVEN (e.g. a LiveJournal community): these comprise the Asexual-other corpus. Using a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, I found moderate distinguishability between the AVEN-main and non-asexual corpura at the level of individual posts when only considering individual words. To rule out the possibility that the classifier was distinguishing AVEN vs. non-AVEN discourse, I first created an algorithm to remove from consideration words that probably refer to users. Second, I used the same classifier on the AVEN-other corpora and the asexual-other corpora. Results for the asexual-other corpus are similar to results for the AVEN-main corpus, while results for the AVEN-other corpus are not. This suggests that the classifier is identifying asexual discourse vs. other discourse. I used the AVEN-core Corpus to generate a list of “key-words” that well-characterize asexual discourse, and then investigate the evolution of three sets of these: intermediate category terms, romantic orientation terms, and the terms repulsed and indifferent. Results provide strong support for the “rise of intermediate categories” hypothesis, and also provide evidence of terminological change for the other two domains. To test the “AVEN shift” hypothesis, I conducted an online survey in Early 2012 about people’s self-understanding prior to and after finding an online asexual community. Results provide evidence for all predictions of the “AVEN shift” hypothesis, although the changes were by no means monolithic. Through this research, I illustrate the utility of applying methodologies from corpus linguistics and from machine learning for investigating the language of specific online communities. Further, I provide novel methodologies (or novel uses of existing methodologies) for problems likely to be faced by other researchers using corpus linguistics to study online language change in specific (sub)communities."

LGBTIQ1 young people are subject to a range of socio-cultural inequities that impact on their health and wellbeing and are particularly at a higher risk of facing mental health issues. Further to this, homophobia, transphobia, (non)disclosure of gender and sexuality identities, and fears of not being understood and/or being judged can prevent LGBTIQ young people from seeking mental health support. ‘You learn from each other’ reports on our research findings on the experiences of LGBTIQ young people seeking mental health support, and how technology can promote mental health and reduce barriers for help-seeking. Our project aims to empower Australian LGBTIQ young people to access mental health support, and to assist service providers and mental health professionals in providing optimal care and support to LGBTIQ young people through the use of technology. The project culminated in the development of the e-tool prototype, RAD Australia – a user-driven online directory to support both LGBTIQ young people’s mental health wellbeing, and the referral processes of health and community workers.Research report on a project that interviewed several LGBTIQ australian youth about how they seek mental healthcare, and developed and received suggestions and feedback for a mental healthcare digital directory.The report especially focuses on trans and nonbinary youth.

There is a disparity in mental health between people who are part of gender and sexual minority groups, and those who are not, meaning that gender and sexual minorities tend to have poorer mental health outcomes and higher incidences of mental health symptoms than people outside of that community. Due to the connection between mental health, marginalization, and stigma in society, this disparity may weigh more heavily on people whose identities are especially marginalized, such as bisexuals, asexuals, trans people in general, and non-binary trans people even more so. It is difficult to determine how exactly mental health disparities impact people with these identities because of the lack of psychological literature about these groups. Further, gender and sexual identities are complex and fluid, and therefore can be hard to define, and although people with some identities tend to experience more stigma than others, whether this correlation can be attributed to the identity itself or to other factors is undetermined. The lack of representation of gender and sexual minorities in literature demonstrates that these marginalized groups are historically ignored in research as well as in broader society.I’ve only taken a quick glance so far, but it seems to include quite a bit of discussion of recent research on asexual experiences with discrimination, pathologization, and barriers to accessing competent mental healthcare. It also has a section on implications for clinicians." True link

This makes  it easy for prospective students or researchers who want to use the library to view it with a single click.In order to edit the library, however (adding, moving, changing, or deleting entries), you must be a member of the group. In order to  become a member, you will need to contact one of the admins (currently me) for an email invite. As of right now, the plan is to allow anyone who sends a request to be a member, so it’s not meant to be exclusive - it’s just a safety measure that allows us to block any trolls or spammers who are found to be messing with library contents.It should be noted that the primary target of this group is asexual community members, whether they are researchers themselves, activists, students, or just people who like to understand or follow asexual research. As such, there will likely be a lot of documentation or discussion that is from the perspective of ace community activists rather than formal academic researchers.That said, we also hope to make this project useful for anyone interested in the study of asexuality, especially in light of the lack of overall asexual research resources for any audiences. That include both non-ace researchers as well as any laypeople who just finds the topic interesting, and we would like to invite them to contribute as well! Project StagesStage 1: Stocking the library (the current step)This is where we are now. At this point, the main goal is getting as many listings as possible into the library, as there is a lot of extant research already out there.Although entries can also be manually entered by hand, by far the easiest way to add new entries is through one of the Zotero browser extensions, which allow you to auto-import things into the library.What’s needed at this point:At the point, what we really need is volunteers who either already use zotero or who are willing to learn,in order to help add as many entries as possible into the library (it only takes about 15 minutes to learn the basics, and I’d be happy to set up quick chats to walk people through it).While it would help to have people who are also knowledgeable about asexual research at this point, it’s not required - one thing that we could use help with is taking existing research lists and adding items from them to Zotero one by one, which requires no knowledge of existing literature at all.Stage 2: Filling in the GapsOnce we have a substantial amount of content added to the library, we’ll need help coming through these entries to add information that is still missing and correct any items that may have imported incorrectly. This means:Adding any lesser known papers that might still be missingAdding missing information to incomplete entries (for example, adding things like author names, publishing companies, years, or other basic info if it has not been imported properly).Correcting any incorrect entries (for example, fixing imports where author first and last name have been incorrectly swapped)Adding links to publicly accessible pdfs, when availableetc.What’s will be needed at that point:At that point, we need people from two groups:On the one hand, people who are well-versed in current asexual research are needed to help find lesser know article that still need to be addedOn the other hand, we also need volunteers to proofread and double check entries, which requires no knowledge of current research at all (just free time and attention to detail)Since this step should (hopefully) be less volume-intensive, this is a place where even people who don’t have zotero installed can help - if you can write up any missing/incorrect items in an email and send it to me or another volunteer to add to Zotero, that would also be great!If you are a current researcher, this would also be a good time to promo any of your own works that we might have missed.Stage 3: Curating the library and adding useful annotations and guidesOnce the library is stocked with a large raw list of research, it’s time to start curating that data in a way that will make it actually useful for people.Making comprehensive sub-lists of specific topics (for example: a sub-library of all articles that mention asexuality and autism, or all articles about asexuality from gender studies journals). These are lists that include all known research on a topic, regardless of quality, and should be editable by anyone.Making curated sub-lists that are carefully crafted to include the most useful and highest quality research on a particular topic. (For example, a list of recommended sociological research, a list of recommended papers for undergrads doing class papers, etc.). As these are inherently subjective, these are ideally curated and signed by specific person or group of people. Adding internal commentary Adding links to external commentary or summaries - for example, adding links to public summaries of paywalled papers, or links to published commentary or criticismStage 4: Continuing to update the bibliography as new research is published Once a basic library is established, the final step is just continuing to update it as new research is released! Here is where we will really rely on crowdsourcing, in the hopes that with many people keeping an eye on research and adding things they spot we will be able to maintain a decently comprehensive list.Again, if you are interested in helping with any of the above, please send in an ask or message or send me an email at sennkestra@gmail.com!"

Here is the PDF of the article.Basically the entire paper is a discussion of the last decade of asexuality research in terms of definition and linguistics.  It covers whether or not asexuality should be classified as a sexual disorder, paraphilia, or its own sexual orientation.  Currently, asexuality is defined by a “lack” of many things; going forward, the authors argue that asexuality should be examined in a positive light.  They also recommend further research into neurobiological components, research not from a sexual standpoint, and broader research into asexuality (not relying solely on AVEN to provide data).
