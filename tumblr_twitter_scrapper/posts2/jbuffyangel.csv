I just enjoy talking to him and everyone seemed to enjoy the giveaways. I asked him what is in store for Diggle in S6. He said more Diggle and Lyla stuff. I asked if it would be carry over issues from S5. He said yeah and referenced ARGUS. But then he said there will be internal conflict in the team and smashed his fists together. I remembered Stephen’s two truths and a lie (he said there would be a rift between Oliver and Diggle). So I asked if him if the conflict was between Oliver and Diggle. David said yes and then explained it will be like Civil War (the movie)." True text

This isn’t like anything we have done before. It’s a great challenge but what we’ve learned in the past (2 times Ship of the Year award winners) is that Olicity fans go BIG!  The project:  - Celebrate Olicity’s legacy by dedicating a bench in their honor in a park of Vancouver (Where Arrow is filmed)  - The bench could now become a mini tourist attraction for fans all over the world who visit Vancouver.  Goal:  - The goal of the project is to raise 4,000$ CAD for a 10 years dedication which is approx. 3,050$ USD depending on the daily exchange rate.  How we will raise the money:  Follow this link to donate https://www.gofundme.com/olicityleavesitsmark What is included in the dedication? - All dedications include a single bronze plaque for inscription (maximum of 3 lines of text and 40 characters per line, including spaces and punctuation). Example of a bench at Stanley Park in Vancouver (Fern detail in the back).  Perks for this campaign - For every 500$ raised, there will be a special giveaway between those who donated 10$ and +. Example of giveaway (An Olicity shirt, Stephen Amell’s Autograph, Arts, Gift boxes etc.) More details coming….  - There will be a poll to determine which Olicity quote will be included on the plaque. & There will also be a poll to determine the exact location of the bench. We have been in contact with the City of Vancouver and they have specific maps for the benches available in parks.  Other Details:  - the money raised is reinvested in the parks for preservation aka the environment.  - If you would like to submit something for the giveaway, if you have any questions about the campaign or would like to submit art pieces to make this campaign beautiful, feel free to contact us @olicitybench on twitter.  Thank you very much! Let the fun begin!   I’m a little late reblogging this, but I thought this was such a fun idea." False text

This is no way means I’m going to get all of these done, but it’s good to have goals.Hiatus ProjectsArrow Season 5 Wrap Up: Yeah… so…. I’m really late on this. I have it written in my head. Doesn’t do y’all much good in there, but it’s thereQ&A: I’ll schedule one of these after I’ve posted the Season 5 Wrap Up. Wonder Woman Review: I saw it. It’s awesome. Review must be done.Arrow Season 1 Reviews: Remember when I actually had a schedule with these?   HA! Yeah me too. Didn’t last long did it? Oh life. You are a time cruncher. I do plan on revisiting these. Maybe knock off a few more before Arrow returns in October.Fanfiction: The past two summer hiatus projects were mostly devoted to big fanfictions (Once and Forever Queen and Broken Pieces). I’m not going big on fics this year, but I do have a couple of ficlet ideas.“Cake”: I owe @callistawolf a fic. This is the working title. She knows what it’s about. It’s gonna happen. I promise.Post 5x23 Reunion Ficlet: Yeah, I’m jumping on that bandgwagon. Too much fun not to.“Broken Pieces” Alternate Ending: Some were unhappy with my ending in Broken Pieces *cough*my beautiful beta Angela*cough* because some convinced me to change my original ending *cough* @callistawolf *cough* for the ending I actually ended up going with. So… because I love @hotcookinmama so much, and she’s such a fabulous & patient editor, I’m going to add the alternate ending I originally intended. It’ll be like “Choose Your Own Adventure” and who doesn’t love “Choose Your Own Adventure” books? NOBODY.Okay. That’s all I got for now. If I achieve half this list this summer I’ll be amazed, but I’m going to give it a go." True text

I could use your help…  and it’s for a good cause too!  Many of you know that I’m an independent consultant with Pampered Chef, one of the top brands of kitchen tools in America. This has been my main source of income for 13 years. I usually go into people’s homes, do cooking classes and make commission from the sales of tools. Due to some health issues in the past 6 months, my business has been on the back burner. Unfortunately, that now means it’s crunch time for me. I have to reach certain sales goals this month or else I lose my leadership position in the sales force.  I did some brainstorming with @fiacresgirl and @scu11y22 . We came up with the idea of doing an Arrow Fandom VIRTUAL Pampered Chef Party to raise money for the American Cancer Society.  Up to 35% of the sales will be donated to the fight against breast cancer.  What’s a Pampered Chef Virtual Party? It’s a week-long group on Facebook. I post recipes, give cooking tips, host games and giveaway prizes! You participate at your pace when you have the time. It’s a lot of fun!  If you’re worried about losing your fandom anonymity by using your real-world Facebook page, keep in mind, you don’t have to share with anyone your Tumblr or Twitter name. All anyone knows is that we’re all fellow Arrow fans! So, want to learn to cook better than Felicity?  Don’t fail this omelette!  I’ll give a lesson on omelettes and I might even try a soufflé.  I might not be able to teach you how to catch a bottle like Oliver does… but I can show you some super easy ways to open a wine bottle!

There’s really no medium like this. The experience is over in a couple hours with a movie.  We can control how quickly we read a book (even if we have to wait for additional sequels). But television? Television is a week to week story that spans years. Or at least it is if you watch live from start to finish. Television can be a long and arduous journey. Full of ups and downs. Great episodes and horribly bad ones.  We walk the road with the characters in real time. It’s a serious time investment and the hope is the story eventually connects. That the threads the writers weave come together in the end and we can see the full picture.  ""Lian Yu"" is one of those rare storytelling gifts that repays all the many years of patience.  We started this journey with Oliver Queen five years ago. We have walked each step with him. We’ve rejoiced with Oliver in his moments of triumph. We’ve grieved with him. We threw things at him with every maddening step backward. Step by step, we’ve watched Oliver come back to life. It hurt and he fought it for a long time, but slowly Oliver began to learn how to live again. Instead of shutting himself off, he chose to build a life filled with purposehonor teamworkfriendshipfamily and love. He’s clawed his way out of the dark and into the light that was always there, deep inside.  It was all leading somewhere. A destination, a choice, Oliver had to make. No matter how far Oliver has come there is always a piece of him that remains on the island… and on the boat.  Oliver had to return to Lian Yu, one last time, so he could finally let it go. So he could finally come home.A hero’s story is fraught with triumph and tragedy. There is both in “Lian Yu.” The great tragedy is once Oliver decides who he is, and is ready for all that entails, he’s faced with an impossible choice and loses what he’s spent years building.Or did he? Adrian Chase is the master chess player. He was always ten moves ahead, even in the final moments, but perhaps there was a move Chase couldn’t foresee. One Oliver set in motion years ago, in a moment where he clung to the light and held to Diggle and Felicity’s faith in him. A moment where Oliver kept a promise.Let’s dig in…Oliver QueenAs I often say, Arrow is about many things and we all have our favorite areas of focus. This story is about Olicity and Original Team Arrow for me, but it’s also about family. Family is core to what I love about Arrow. This story will always begin with Robert Queen for me. That tragedy on the boat is what drew me in and made me come back for Episode 2. This is the moment when everything changed for Oliver Queen. This is the moment the man he was died. Then, Oliver arrived on Purgatory and the island made him into something new. A Phoenix rising from the ashes.Oliver Queen carries many sins on his shoulders. He carries his father’s and he carries his own. There is intense guilt that comes from all those sins. They are like stones around Oliver’s neck. These stones weigh Oliver down, stop him from moving forward and, if they are heavy enough, roll him back. However, there is one sin that weighs more than all the others. It’s a shame and guilt that keeps Oliver trapped forever on Lian Yu. Robert Queen’s death.As I explained in my 5x20 review, Robert Queen is the reason Oliver believed he was a monster. Robert Queen is the reason Oliver believed he enjoyed killing. It is the one “What If” Oliver cannot escape from. If he never got on the boat, then his father would be alive. Robert could have made it to the island. He could have survived… if not for his son. In Oliver’s eyes, Robert Queen paid for his selfishness. Oliver believes, in his bones, that he killed his father.Arrow is a hero’s tale. In any hero’s tale there is a defining event. The catalyst that forever changes the hero from the person they were and turns them into the person they will become.  This event is almost always a tragedy.Why is it always tragedy? Because what these people experience would stop most humans in their tracks. Instead they rise.  This horrific moment propels them forward as they become more than a person. They become a symbol. A symbol for justice. A guardian for those who cannot defend themselves because once they were the defenseless. They have experienced the bitterness of injustice, the humiliation when someone breaks you down, and the unbearable pain of losing a loved one while being powerless to stop it. A hero rises and reclaims their power to ensure what happened to them never happens to anyone ever again. It is why we read their stories. It is why we admire them. It is why we love them. However, as much as this tragedy can propel the hero forward it can also be what holds them back. Eventually, the hero must make their peace with what happened. Otherwise their evolution remains trapped; forever locked in between the past and future. Eventually, a choice must be made.It’s important to know the genre of your story.  The will always be trials and tribulations in a hero’s journey. The hero will always fall, but the beauty in the tale is how he/she gets back up. That’s where a hero’s evolution lives. That’s how he/she becomes the very best parts of humanity. A hero finds a way to do what most of us couldn’t. Ultimately, the point of a hero’s tale is to challenge us to be better people. Adrian Chase is the embodiment of Oliver’s past, much like other villains before him. However, unlike the other villains, Chase is not motivated by revenge or power. Chase wants to reflect Oliver’s darkness back to him. So, that reflection becomes Oliver’s truth… because it is Adrian’s truth. Adrian believes Oliver Queen is death.Oliver began killing as a means of survival, but eventually it morphed into something else. A means to an end. A necessity. The cost of a nightly war. What I love about Arrow is that it doesn’t shy away from the examination of Oliver’s choices. “Lian Yu” takes that examination to another level. Yes, The Hood killed Justin Claybourne. That choice gave birth to Prometheus. Adrian Chase is created from Oliver’s killing, the darkest part of him.  Even though Oliver believed he made those choices out of necessity, and honorable reasons, he cannot escape the other haunting question - is there another choice? If there is, what does that choice look like? Where does it lead?Source: SMOAKS Oliver’s entire team is captured. He’s never beat the bad guy by himself. He’s always had Felicity and Diggle by his side and Oliver KNOWS this. He knows he cannot do it alone and that means asking for help anywhere he can find it. Source: captainheroism There’s a sense of trepidation as Oliver enters the ARGUS prison. Slade Wilson is the greatest villain in Arrow’s history (or at least he was until Prometheus). So what version of Slade are we going to get? Is it the Slade we fell in love with? The man who taught Oliver Queen how to survive and became a brother to him? Or is it the man we hate? The man who became consumed with revenge and killed Moira Queen.It would seem the Slade we’re going to get is the man of Season 1. The man we love, although he is forever changed by his actions of Season 2. The Mirakuru is out of his system and he’s regained his sanity. The rage over Shado’s death has settled into a quiet grief. Slade asks Oliver the question we’re all asking - why is Oliver asking for his help?Oliver explains Chase has everyone Oliver holds dear - including Thea and his son. Now, before we Olicity shippers get our panties in a twist I think those mentioned were calculated on Oliver’s part. He’s trying to get a read on Slade. Slade has expressed guilt over Moira’s death, an act Thea bore witness to. By mentioning Thea, Oliver is potentially twisting the guilt knife to illicit Slade’s help. As for William, Slade is a father and if there is humanity in him then I believe Oliver is trying to appeal to his fatherly compassion. Oliver offers Slade his freedom and the chance to find his son, Joe Wilson, to sweeten the pot.I love that Oliver has been searching for Joe Wilson. Slade was never gone from Oliver’s mind. The idea that the son could come back to avenge the father is something that occurred to Oliver I believe.  It’s not unlike Adrian Chase, except Oliver knows Joe exists. Oliver wanted to be prepared.  The one area that is the potential powder keg to this accord between Slade and Oliver is Shado. Shado’s death is what kicked off the war to begin with and I think Oliver’s omission of Felicity’s name, even though she’s included in “everyone,” is probably wise. Oliver still has the love of his life, whereas Slade does not. Felicity Smoak has always been the red zone between these two men. This is a delicate peace Oliver is brokering. Best not to poke the bear. Speaking from a psychological standpoint, I think it’s smart.The mere fact that Oliver is even considering working with the man who killed his mother shows how desperate he is and… how much he loves everyone Chase has taken. The past doesn’t matter when his future is at stake. Oliver sets it aside and asks the man who murdered his mother for help. That takes a strength and grace most people do not have. It would seem Slade Wilson agrees.Slade: I think I’m stating the obvious when I say I killed your mother. For that alone, you should have killed me.Oliver: Maybe what’s happening now is the reason I didn’t.This is a vitally important line, which is why it is in the first act. For all those worried about the cliffhanger, this is the line you pay attention to because it’s the ballgame. Source:  zorro-rita There’s an extreme amount of hilariousness with Oliver and his new band of Merry Men… err and woman. The sniping between Nyssa and Merlyn is funny enough to make a case for their own spin off. I don’t know what this show would be. All I know is I’d watch it. Oliver also frees Boomerang, Digger Harkness, which leads to a confrontation with Nyssa. Source:   queensarrow  ALL HAIL THE QUEEN. Although, I would have preferred she’d chosen a different piece of anatomy, but we’re still on at 8/7c. Next year kids. Source:  zorro-rita Chase blows up Oliver’s plane and Team Misfit Toys is completely unfazed. CLASSIC. It does, however, present a problem and makes this remark seem wildly more relevant.Nyssa & Merlyn split up from Oliver, Slade and Digger. They find the some of the team (Felicity, Thea, Curtis and Samantha) in cages. There’s a really fascinating shift as Slade and Oliver divide. Oliver goes to Samantha to inquire about William. Slade immediately moves to Felicity’s cage. Given their history, I should be uneasy, but it feels like Slade is working in tangent with Oliver. William is an innocent and Oliver has to find his son, but that doesn’t make Felicity any less important to him. So, Slade puts his body in front of the woman he once tried to kill - to protect her. Or maybe I just so desperately want to believe Slade Wilson is redeemable because, a long time ago, I loved him. It’s all too easy because it’s supposed to be. Talia shows up with Evelyn and aims an arrow on Samantha while Diggler Hartness pulls a gun on Slade. Chase already made a deal with him. Evenlyn makes an interesting comment to Slade. She says Chase told them it would be pointless to reach out to him. Chase has done his homework on everyone in Oliver’s life. If he thought he could use Slade he would have. Or this is all part of the ruse? Y'all… this is fun. I’m having a good time. Digger offers Slade the same deal and it seems like Slade takes him up on it. Now… I missed this watching the episode but that’s why we have fandom members with eagle eyes and wonderful gif makers. Slade tells Evelyn to put a gun on Oliver.This is a call back to 1x14 and @cogentranting does a wonderful job detailing the beauty of this scene. It’s a coded message to Oliver. While it may seem like Slade is betraying Oliver, he is not. Slade is telling Oliver exactly what to do, so they can all survive. Oliver executes the move perfectly. Just as Slade trained him.Source:   arrowsourceHe tosses Evelyn like a rag doll. It’s awesome. Also, physically speaking incredibly accurate because Amell is a mountain man compared to Madison McLaughlin. Source: arrowsourceThe little flick of the dagger to knock Talia’s arrow, and thus saving Samantha, is the precision we have come to expect from our hero.Oliver needs to focus on finding William, Diggle, Rene, Quentin and Dinah, so he asks Curtis, Thea, Samantha and Felicity to leave the island. Oh… don’t worry. We’re going to talk about Olicity. Next section. Hang tight.With a lull in the action, Slade wants to know what went down between Oliver and Chase. Oliver can’t understand why his past continues to come back to haunt him and Slade just decides to lay it out for him in plain English. It’s season finale time folks! No time for beating around the bush.Source:   1-crazy-dreamerSource:   olivergifsOliver: You say that like it’s easy.Slade: It’s the hardest thing in this world.I HAVE WAITED FIVE YEARS FOR THIS CONVERSATION. IT WAS WORTH EVERY SECOND. This is the shame that has defined Oliver Queen for ten years. It’s been a boulder around his neck and no matter how far he goes, there’s always some part of him that is still drowning. There is always some part of him that is in that boat with his dad. Robert Queen asked his son to survive and Oliver cannot forgive himself that he did. Oliver cannot forgive himself that his father had to die so he could live.Shame feeds into everything. It infects the very marrow of our bones until it becomes part of our DNA. Until, it starts to define who we are. Robert Queen’s death was first domino in a long line of death, pain and loss. It was the first domino of sin that kicked off all the others. Oliver chose to cheat on Laurel with Sara. He chose to get on the boat with Sara. This all lead to Robert’s death in Oliver’s mind and, in some respects, Oliver is right.However, if Oliver can forgive himself for Robert that will also be a domino effect. This guilt is the most difficult to let go of. Robert’s death is the one Oliver blames himself for above all others. But if Oliver can forgive himself for Robert’s death, if he can let the shame go, then the forgiveness will also be a domino effect in the same way the guilt was. It will be easier to forgive himself for all the other sins he carries. That’s why we’re focusing on Robert Queen again. This is where the pain started for Oliver. This is where it must end.It’s fitting for Slade to tell him. Oliver is a man now. The boy his was before Lian Yu is long gone. Yet, when it comes to our parents we will always be children. Oliver will always be that boy in the boat. Before Shado, Mirakuru and Moira, Slade Wilson was Oliver’s friend. What’s more, he was a father figure to Oliver when he needed one - much like Yao Fei. In fact, most of the friends Oliver encountered over those five years were surrogate fathers in their own way. Oliver was constantly searching for a way to connect to his father again, to stop missing what he lost and ease the pain.Slade knows Oliver. He was by his side those two years on the island. They spent countless nights by the fire. Slade understands Oliver’s guilt, because he carries it himself. Not simply for the things he did as Deathstroke, but for surviving too when Shado, and even Billy Wintergreen, did not.  It all comes down to high noon. Team Arrow and Team Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs face off.  Honestly, I needed commercial breaks just to breathe. The editing, cutting back and forth between flashbacks and present day, is seamless. The juxtaposition between Oliver fighting Chase and Oliver fighting Kovar is also extremely important. It’s similar to the way Arrow cut back and forth between Oliver’s fight with Slade in the past/present for 2x23 as well. The point is to highlight the different choices Oliver is about to make.There were two things Robert Queen asked of Oliver on that boat. The first was to right his wrongs. The second was to survive. Oliver has struggled for ten years to understand what those requests meant.When Oliver kills Kovar I believe he is killing out of survival. However, there is a difference between killing out of survival and killing out of revenge or retribution. It’s a delicate balance, one Oliver has struggled to find in himself. The truth is, he’s not on the island anymore. Killing is not the only means of survival and it is not the way justice is best served. Or at least… that’s not the justice Robert Queen was asking Oliver to bring to Starling City. Moral justification is not enough of a reason to end someone’s life. Oliver is being called to something greater than that. He was called in that boat. It’s simply taken him ten years to understand it.This all started because Robert Queen killed someone. Yes, it was an accident, but it doesn’t erase that he hid it. The shame followed Robert. It led to Merlyn and The Undertaking. Death begets death. This cycle all started with killing. So, killing is not the way to end it. Robert was asking his son to be a better man than he was. Robert was asking Oliver to find another way. Oliver does not kill Chase even though he is morally justified to do so. Chase kidnapped his son. He threatened everything most dear to Oliver. But see… that’s the point. Oliver began this season believing, because of Laurel’s death, that killing needed to be back on the table. As long as he was morally justified in taking a life then he should be willing to do what is necessary. Oliver believed taking a life will ultimately save lives. However, even though we may be morally justified in taking someone’s life it doesn’t mean that we SHOULD.  That’s the lesson Oliver has learned. There is another choice and… there is justice in that choice. Even more important is Oliver’s soul. He’s not a monster. He doesn’t enjoy killing, but every time he does it strips a piece of his soul. All of the men Oliver killed were evil. I believe the world would be better off without them. However, there is a cost to Oliver’s soul. There is a price Oliver and all those he loves will pay. That’s the cycle and it will only end when Oliver chooses differently. When Oliver finds another way. Oliver found another way not so long ago. He had the chance to show Slade Wilson mercy on the island and instead he chose to drive an arrow through is eye. There was a penance for that choice. When the time came for Oliver to choose again… he chose differently. Source:olivergifsOliver cannot kill Chase because then Adrian wins.  If he does, then Adrian’s truth is correct: All that exists in Oliver is darkness. He killed Adrian’s father. Oliver Queen killed his own father. He is death. But that’s a shame Oliver will no longer carry. Adrian can blame Oliver for his father’s death. Chase can carry that weight, but Oliver will no longer carry Robert’s suicide. He’s ready to let it go now. Source: @callistawolfMe:It’s a beautiful contrast to one of the most heartbreaking scenes of the episode. After Oliver is rescued he calls his mom.  And just like that… Moira is back. She is dressed in a beautiful black dress, on her way out to dinner. It’s like a freeze frame on how we began the series , to the way the Queen family was and everything Oliver has lost (and gained) since then. She doesn’t believe him at first, but then Moira listens to his voice.Source:   @callistawolfSource:   olivergifsOliver begs his mother not to hang up and everything he’s been shutting down for these past five years comes flooding back all at once. He’s a little boy again, who’s lost and just wants to come home to his mom. But then Moira asks the question.Oliver closes his eyes, tears streaming down his face. He can’t speak. This is the reason he couldn’t go home. This is why he couldn’t face his family. He’s been running from this call for five years. For so long, Oliver called it “the darkness” and said Moira and Thea wouldn’t recognize who he is. But the darkness is his shame. It is Robert Queen. Oliver couldn’t bear to tell his mother and sister that Robert is dead. No matter what Oliver does from now on he can never bring his father home.Source:  @callistawolfForgiveness is a grace. It’s a grace we give to others and it’s one we give to ourselves. We have to choose it like anything else. Oliver finally, after all these years, chooses to forgive himself for Robert’s death… and for what came after. This won’t be a onetime thing. Oliver will have to choose it every day, but the first time is the hardest. The guilt and shame falls like an anchor from his chest. We know it does because even when Adrian tells Oliver that William is dead he does not bend.Source: olivergifsHonestly I gasped. The mere thought of Oliver losing his son sent a chill down my spine. Anyone losing their child is an unthinkable horror. Even though we don’t know William well the moment still carried a significant emotional weight for me. Who is William? He is a child. An innocent. He is a piece of Oliver that is pure. It doesn’t matter that I haven’t seen episode after episode of Oliver parenting him. It doesn’t matter to me that I haven’t seen them playing catch or Felicity teaching William how to code. It doesn’t matter to me that I don’t know what William likes to play or what subjects he’s good at or if he’s funny. All of those details will come in time as Oliver embraces fatherhood in a different way. But the innocence of William will always be true. That will always be who he is and what he represents because that’s who all children are. That’s what all children represent.Stephen gives a powerhouse performance as he faces Adrian once again. He’s right to believe Adrian is manipulating him, but Oliver also acknowledges there exists the possibility that his son his dead. His voice shatters, the strength breaking from the thought of such an overwhelming grief. There could be no greater moral justification than taking the life of the person who took the life of your child.  Source: arrowsourceYet, even then Oliver refuses to kill Chase. Yes, because then Adrian would win but also because the cycle of death that started with Robert Queen needs to be broken.  A hero is called to be more than we believe we are capable of. A hero holds to a code, in the face of insurmountable odds, and refuses to bend. It is how they become the example, the beacon of light, for everyone else. Oliver holds to his code. He refuses to bend. Not even if his son is dead.Of course, Chase has a few final moves on the chess board left. He’s rigged the island to explode, but it’s a dead man’s trigger. If Oliver kills Chase then everyone dies. It’s such a poetically insane fruition to Chase’s plan.Oliver goes after William and they cut between him running through the woods in present day versus the flashback. Oliver is running to a boat in both instances. He’s running towards home in the past and the present. In the flashback, Oliver is running towards home with the weight of the past on his shoulders. Source: olivergifsIn the present, Oliver is running towards home, but is free of the past. He is running to the future. Except, William represents a future, a home, Oliver never dreamed possible five years ago.Oliver Queen always had a light inside him. He always believed that it was the darkness that helped him survive, but now he understands differently. Oliver embraces the truth of who he is.  He is not a killer. Not anymore. He’s become someone else… he’s become something else. That man has the strength to let the guilt go. That man has the will to show mercy to his enemies. That man has the courage to love without fear of loss. That man doesn’t just want to survive. He wants to live.We started this journey with Oliver Queen running through a darkened forest and igniting a fire. It was a signal to the boat, but also a symbol of his rebirth. The fires of Purgatory made him something new, but his journey wasn’t over. He was just beginning.Source: @callistawolfNow, we are watching Oliver run through a forest of light. The sun beams down on him as he chases after his son. Oliver Queen has chosen life in every way possible. This is the evolution we’ve waited for.  It’s the man Robert Queen never imagined, yet always believed Oliver could become. It’s the man Robert gave his life for. There is nothing but light because Oliver is that light. He is The Green Arrow. It means Oliver is ready for one final test. One final choice. Oliver and Prometheus battle on a boat, where this all began. Chase leads them out into the very same waters where Robert Queen died and brings out William. Oliver’s terror chokes in his throat and he holds the arrow on Chase, but his hand is shaking.   Source:olivergifsHe’s been here before. Oliver lost his innocence in this very same spot. It hollowed him out and he’s fought for ten years to claw his way back. Now, he’s facing that loss again. Only this time he is not the son. He is the father.Chase remarks how Oliver only seems concerned about William despite his entire team trapped on the island facing certain death. This is an extremely smart writing choice. It addresses the “What about Felicity?” and “What about Diggle?” questions head on. Oliver tells Chase his team can handle themselves. This is a moment of monumental growth for Oliver. There was a time Oliver couldn’t fathom trusting anyone out of fear of losing them.  Now, Oliver puts his faith in his team. He believes they can save themselves. He entrusts his heart into their hands. Oliver is also acknowledging they are all soldiers. Felicity, Diggle, Quentin, Thea, Curtis, Rene and Dinah chose this life.  Oliver respects their choice. William chose nothing. I firmly believe every single team member, INCLUDING FELICITY,  would tell Oliver to choose his son. Every team member would take a bullet for William or any child for that matter. They are heroes. And no, Samantha is not a member of Team Arrow. She didn’t choose this life, but she is William’s mother. She will gladly give up her life for him. Oliver is exactly where he needs to be.Chase gives Oliver the choice. Save William by killing Chase and therefore his entire team OR let Chase kill William and the team survives.  Oliver faced a similar choice with Moira and Thea with Slade. Slade was driven by revenge, fueled by an intense grief over the loss of Shado. Even in all his madness, there was humanity in that evil. But Chase? He’s only driven by the hollow truth he lives by - that Oliver Queen is a monster. This isn’t about revenge over his father. Chase believes Oliver freed him with that act. He could become who he was meant to be. Now, Chase wants to return the favor. He wants to reveal who Oliver truly is. Adrian simply wants to be proven right. There is no humanity in Sam Morrison. Oliver refused to choose between Moira and Thea, so his mother chose for him. Oliver and Felicity found another way. They always had the upper hand with Slade. This time is different. Chase has the upper hand. The choice is Oliver’s and his alone.So much of Oliver’s life is made up of these moments. Times when he wished he’d gone left instead of right. Choosing between who lives and who dies. It’s been ten years of making these choices and learning from them. Part of the challenge of being a hero, being worthy of the mantle, is to find a way out when your back is against the wall. When presented with Option A or B, a hero has to find C. That’s what Oliver failed to do in Season 4… and it’s what he does now. He lowers the bow, seemingly like the choice is made. Oliver is going to let Chase kill his son… but then he fires. It’s not a kill shot.  Source: itbericeIt goes into Adrian’s foot, but it’s enough to give Oliver the chance to pull William away. Oliver doesn’t make a choice between William and his team. He finds another way.Source:   olivergifsOliver holding William makes me so emotional.  Oliver lost his father, but he saved his son.  Also, points for wearing a green hoodie William. I like you kid.Source:   songbinBut Adrian Chase punishes Oliver for refusing to choose.  He whispers to Oliver about how much he and William will need each other. How lonely it will be without Mom… and Felicity. Then Chase puts a gun to his head and pulls the trigger.  It’s a horrific parallel to the same choice Robert Queen made. Only Robert killed himself to save Oliver’s life. Source:   olivergifsAdrian Chase kills himself to destroy Oliver’s life. Source:  songbin The flash of Chase’s gun reflects in Oliver’s eyes and the horror of what is about to happen hits him. Oliver turns, holding his son, and watches as Lian Yu, the island called Purgatory, bursts into flames and takes everyone Oliver loves with it.  A final recompense for Oliver’s sins? (Shh… no. Hang in there with me.)The boy, who lost his father, now is the father with only his boy.source:   itberice What makes this tragedy all the worse is that Oliver is finally ready to be the brother, friend and husband he is meant to be. The weight that held him back from the future he is meant to have, with the  family he fought so hard to build, is gone. In the moment Oliver is free, in the moment he is truly home, he loses everything again.So that’s it huh? Blew up the cast. Game over. Thanks a lot Arrow.HA. Right. Come on kiddos. Don’t tell me you buy that for a hot second. There’s more to it.  I raised you better. This idea of blowing up the cast (via boat and not island) bounced around the fandom for awhile and I always had a beef with it because… HOW IS THAT A CLIFFHANGER? I still hold to that beef. (Not with those who had the idea, but simply from a writing standpoint).  I believe Marc has confirmed Emily, David, Paul and Willa will all be back for Season 6 on his Tumblr. (I’m too lazy to look for it, but it’s there folks.) So, we know they survive. It doesn’t make for much of a cliffhanger.Well… unless the question isn’t who survived, but rather HOW they survive. Admittedly, Samantha, Slade and Evelyn are all possible fatalities, but the series regulars are safe. I am confident about that. That’s where things get interesting though. That’s where Arrow reveals a potential long game that’s been a few years in the making. If I’m right. So, how does Team Arrow survive?Slade Wilson.There has been ONE villain Oliver Queen has not killed. Despite being absolutely morally justified in killing him, Oliver showed Slade mercy. And why? Because he made a promise to Tommy. Because Felicity believed he could find another way. Oliver held to that promise and that belief in the face of crushing rage and grief. And in the end… found the way.Oliver began this season believing killing was necessary. He chose not to kill Damien Darhk and Laurel died. Therefore, killing had to be back on the table to save lives. To make sure what happened to Laurel never happened to anyone else he loves.But what if… the opposite is true? What if mercy offers Oliver that same opportunity? What if mercy can also save lives? Slade’s desire for redemption is clear. He more than proved his loyalty to Oliver in “Lian Yu.” Slade protects Felicity. He refuses to leave without Oliver and William. And… nobody knows this island better. It’s a move on the chess board Adrian Chase couldn’t have foreseen because it’s something a man like Chase could never understand. The one villain Oliver offered life to will be the man who saves the lives of everyone he holds dear. Oliver found another way three years before Prometheus ever came into their lives and that choice is what will beat Adrian in the end. Oliver will return to the island. He will not leave without being sure. He won’t leave another body behind on the island that already took so many. When Oliver does he will find his loved ones and the lesson that’s been years in the making. Life begets life.Source:   queensarrowOlicityOh the FEELS. I LIVE FOR THIS ANGSTY SHIT!!!Listen, the point of Season 5 was for Oliver to finally get his crap together so he could be ready for a relationship with Felicity Smoak. Felicity had some stuff to work on her end too, don’t get me wrong, but it was mostly Oliver.So, I wasn’t expecting too much of an Olicity focus simply because we needed to close out this five year journey and Oliver’s emotional baggage. This puts a big spotlight on Oliver for the finale, which I’m fine with. I had different goals for 5x23. I wanted emotional resolution on all the stuff I just spent 15 pages talking about. Felicity is the future and “Lian Yu” is very much about Oliver dealing with the past, so he can be ready for that future. BUT I am extremely happy with the Olicity scene we did get. Oliver finds his girl, of course, but the fact that he’s aligned with the man who put a sword to her throat does not go unnoticed.Source:   westallenolicitygifsOh how I love a communicative Olicity. Also, Felicity is the boss. Never forget it.Oliver tells Malcolm to get them off the island, but Felicity doesn’t want to leave Oliver. But he can’t risk her. Source:    sharingmyworld Oh… I will never grow tired of the 2x23 dance. Let us waltz this waltz forever with my loves.This time is a little different than 2x23. William is a factor and Oliver needs to focus on finding his son. He can’t do that if he’s worrying about Felicity and if she’s on the island then he’s going to be worrying about her. That puts both their lives in danger. Just jump into Oliver’s waking nightmare. Oliver is all business at first, giving Felicity detailed imagery of the island “just in case.” Felicity hesitates for just a moment, but then she stands on her tiptoes (I love that she has to do that) and pulls Oliver to her. It’s a sweet and gentle kiss. Oliver is surprised at first, but in spite of the madness surrounding them, he allows himself a moment. A moment to breathe her in and to feel her lips against his. He’s missed her. He’s missed this. Lian Yu melts away and it’s just the two of them again. When it ends, the “all business” approach is gone. He’s her Oliver. He softens his voice, to the tone that’s reserved just for Felicity. There’s a little smile playing on his lips, but he can’t hide his surprise. So much for hypothetically dating huh big fella?Source:   gothsmoakFelicity is scared. Oliver reassures her that they will make it through, but Felicity is right. He can’t know that.    Source:amanitacaplanThey’ve both made their fair share of mistakes, but not kissing Oliver is one Felicity won’t allow. She won’t regret that. YOUR OTP COULD NEVERFeeling regretful is a natural part of rebuilding. You wish you said and did things differently. It can take awhile to realize that maybe it all happened the way it was supposed to. That the lessons you learned from the breaking were just as important if you had never broken at all.What does Felicity regret? Closing the door forever. For losing faith Oliver could change. Not telling Oliver she was leaving the door open for them. Dating Billy. (Alright that one might be mine.) Pushing him away because she was hurt and angry. Wasting so much time because she was terrified to get hurt again.It doesn’t mean Felicity should regret all of this. It’s simply where her mind and heart is right now. And yes… Oliver has regrets too. We spent a lot of time on them from 5x17-5x23, so Imma gonna skip the gifs.It’s why he tells Felicity they will talk about it when find their way off the island…. when they go home. Together. It’s such a beautifully soft and tender moment. A gentle reminder to Oliver of everything he is fighting to save.  Source: underconstruction87Slade is wildly interested in Oliver’s personal life. He can’t understand how Oliver married Ra’s Al Ghul’s daughter and not “the blonde.” Welcome to the fandom Wilson. Bar in the back. We’ve been getting boozy over 3x22 for awhile now. Oliver says Nyssa talks too much, but Slade is all, “TELL ME MORE."" It’s like his own personal version of Days of Our Lives. I mean… the guy has gone without television for awhile. While we’re on the subject, he’d like to know what’s happening on Days of Our Lives. We also had a long awaited conversation between Felicity and Samantha. Felicity stating again how she wasn’t in favor of Oliver sending William away, but then pointedly adding that she wasn’t consulted, gives me life. It pretty much sums up the break up too, which is why it’s funny to me that Felicity tells Samantha it’s ""complicated."" No precious unicorn. That’s about the it. I think Felicity is being gracious because she has to co-parent with this woman. If you want to talk reasons for Oliver and Felicity breaking up, let’s start with your RIDICULOUS AND ILLOGICAL ultimatum Samantha.  Pause. I have to start doing my breathing exercises. Otherwise I slip back into 4x08 Ragey Jen.  Okay, I’m good.Source:   felicitysSeriously, everybody ships these two. One kiss and Samantha is sold. Bar is in the back honey. Slade is drinking a Mai Tai with Diggle and Curtis.I was sent some of tweets about Samantha being jealous. She wasn’t jealous. I vehemently disagree. Perhaps she was exhausted from being held in a cage, sick of walking through the woods and worried to death about William. But I am confident there are no ""feelings” for Oliver there. Samantha is simply pointing out the obvious. There is so much love between Oliver and Felicity and that love can conquer whatever is “complicated.” PREACH MY SISTER. Keep talking like this and stop complicating things for my babies with your crazy ultimatums and you can stay.The final scene with Chase is eerily horrifying because we know what’s going to happen.  We know just as Oliver has become the man Felicity knew he always could be… he’s going to lose her.Robert Queen’s final word was, “Survive."" Chase’s final word is a name, ""Felicity."" The pairing in the parallel is clear. Felicity is where the road to survival led. Their love brought Oliver back to life. Source:   feilcityqueenChase posed the Thea versus Felicity question to Oliver. While I believe Oliver cannot live without either of these women, Chase answers it. Adrian knows Oliver. He knows that when the day is over, and William is asleep in bed, the loneliness will settle in. Oliver will ache to hold Felicity and hear the sound of voice. Thea is Oliver’s family, but Felicity is his life. She is the life Oliver secretly dreamed of, but never thought possible. He wanted to raise William with her, have children with her, and grow old with her.  And in flash… she’s gone. Source: gothsmoak Yeah… except she’s not. We know she’s not because Arrow is not insane. We’re going to tune in for Season 6 and watch as Oliver reunites with the love of his life, after thinking she died, AND we’ll be in a 9 pm time slot baby!!!It’s been a long road back to Oliver and Felicity, but I believe it was worth every step of the journey. Even the wildly frustrating ones. If Arrow paralleling Robert Queen’s ""survive” with the final word spoken at the end of this five year journey (“Felicity”) does not confirm their endgame status to you then honestly folks… I do not know what will. Felicity was always the last piece to this puzzle. When Oliver and Felicity are reunited next season they will finally begin to live that puzzle, the whole picture, in the life they build together.Malcolm Merlyn and Thea QueenSource: arrowsourceOh Thea. Never change. As predicated, Merlyn goes out in a blaze of glory. He takes Thea’s place on the landmine. His speech to her is moving and, despite being super evil, pretty accurate about parenthood.The death happens off screen, and Merlyn is the magician after all, so I’m always a little wary. We’ve danced this dance before Arrow! However, given that the entire island blew up I feel it’s safe to say that Merlyn is dead. It’s fitting too. He’s the reason Oliver ended up on Lian Yu. This should be the place Malcolm Merlyn dies. Malcolm took Oliver’s father from him, but his death saves his sister. He is also able to give Thea what he was never able to give Tommy - he put his child above his own desires. Source: zorro-ritaOf course, Merlyn goes out like the bad ass motherfucker he is - taking Digger and a bunch of LOA members with him. My sincerest hope is the character remains dead. I love John Barrowman, but Merlyn has reached the finish line. This is a necessary end to the villain who started it all. It’s a good death.Thea’s emotional conflict over Merlyn’s death is played out so beautifully by Willa Holland. This is what Doug Ross (ER) had to say after his father died:“I hated the son of a bitch and I loved him.”Pretty much sums up Thea and Merlyn for me. Thea shares her emotional turmoil with Felicity. She lists all the horrible things Malcolm has done, but she cannot help missing him. No one understands more than Felicity Smoak. Her own father is quite a piece of work too. Felicity gently tells Thea that yes, her father was super evil, but he loved her in his own way.    Source:amanitacaplanThen, she kisses Thea on the forehead and hugs her. This is the sisterly bonding I need.My hope is with Merlyn’s death that Thea is freed from some of her pain in the same way Oliver is freed from his. By sacrificing himself for his daughter, hopefully Thea can see there can be good even in a monster.  If there can be goodness in a man like Malcolm Merlyn, then Thea has no reason to fear what is inside her.Nyssa and Talia Al GhulThe action and fight sequences are exceptional in “Lian Yu” (ALL THE PRAISE JAMES BAMFORD), but I have to say one of my favorite fights is  between Nyssa and Talia Al Ghul. This is the heavy weight fight I waited all season for. Talia obviously has her issues with Nyssa for aligning with Oliver Queen. However, I’m glad Arrow took the time for Nyssa to outline her issues with Talia. Source:   itbericeShe essentially abandoned Nyssa to their tyrant father because Talia craved power.  We’re all aware of Ra’s Ah Ghul’s stance on Nyssa’s sexuality, so growing up with that man had to be a nightmare. A nightmare Talia may have been able to ease if she put family over power.   TEAM NYSSA ALL THE WAY!   The kicking of Talia’s ass was one of the episode highlights for me.Source:   sonadorasBl*ck S*ren and Bl*ck C*nary.The Screaming Canaries is another showdown highlight.  I know who my Canary is!!! Source:   sharingmyworldTheir canary cries canceling each other out is pretty hilarious though.BS is straight up evil in the finale, as predicted.  She gave zero fucks about Oliver and did nothing to help anyone. Villain, villain, villain and a bumbling one at that! Slade tricks her into believing he is on Chase’s team, which gives Oliver the opportunity to give Dinah her canary collar thing. This is good. Let’s keep this up for S6.No joke, I legit SCREAMED when this happened.Source: sharingmyworldSO. MUCH. GLORIOUSNESS. It’s bloody fantastic Quentin Lance anoints Dinah Drake as the Bl*ck C*nary and in the episode she’s facing off with BS. This entire exchange is so much GOLD. Source:   lindsayshalsteadBAM.   Bitch goes down!!!!“FOR SO MANY REASONS.”Arrow never grows tired of shading the haters and if these are the scenes we’re going to get now that KC is back then consider me SOLD. This is going to be so much fun.If any Felicity Smoak hater comes into your yard blustering about Arrow blowing her up, simply remind them they blew up their fave AGAIN. Except not a single character cares. Well, first apply logic and tell them neither character was blown up. But when that inevitably fails use the above argument.Stray ThoughtsPretty seamless transition from this finale to the pilot. Although, I have questions for Oliver’s hairdresser. Did Oliver pay the hairdresser off when he/she removed the wig?Let’s talk about the smoke trick thing. Is there a trap door? The smoke doesn’t travel far enough for them to run even 100 feet. WHERE DO THEY GO?  Helicopter can’t make a single shot. Oliver takes down in one. Oh TV I love you.“If it’s anything like the three gulf streams I used to have, yes.” Malcolm continues to be a 1%er asshole up until the end. Points for consistency. Oliver asking Thea to keep Samantha and Felicity safe makes me emotional. There’s no one Oliver trusts more with his future wife. QUEEN SIBILINGS FOREVER. Curtis keeps Felicity safe? Hmmm. Nice try. More like the other way around, but okay Arrow.“Sort of a sweet kid actually. You sure he’s yours?” Chase you are an evil dick of the supreme order, but I will miss your Joker level loony tunes. Josh Segarra was phenomenal. BEST. VILLAIN. EVER.Source:   sharingmyworldRene being supportive is cute. They can date next year. I’m down.Protective Father Oliver is hot.They didn’t want to let go. I’m not crying. There’s just something in my eye. *sniffie* Source: songbinWe blew up Lian Yu. It would have been way more awesome (and far less terrifying) if all my children weren’t on it, but I’m willing to recognize blowing up the island is the shit.So a couple ideas for 6x01. I think the team either made it to the bunker or to the plane. My bet is we’ll see how they survive and then there’s a five month time jump. IF there are flashbacks they might be  immediately post 5x23. I guarantee you there are pilot/finale parallels I missed. I am perfectly okay with that.Season 5 wrap up will be coming later!

With Adrian Chase (Josh Segarra) still on the loose, mysterious  hacker organization Helix offers Felicity (Emily Bett Rickards) a way to  track him down in exchange for her services involving something  illegal. Needless to say, Oliver (Stephen Amell) & Co. won’t be  happy. But Ollie and Felicity will be forced to face their divide head on  next week when the duo gets trapped in the bunker together. Will this  actually bring them closer together? EW turned to executive producer  Wendy Mericle to get the scoop: ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: What can you tease of what Felicity has gotten herself into? And will we get more info on Helix? WENDY MERICLE: We will definitely get more info on Helix. We’re super psyched about this episode because it is really Felicity’s Dark Night of the Soul.  We’re not going to wrap it up here, but we’re definitely going to take  her to one of the darkest places we’ve ever seen her character go.  Because she’s gone down this rabbit hole with Helix, she’s going to find  out that — as per usual when people get themselves involved with these  organizations — things aren’t always as they seem. Even though she has  been really blinded by her drive to get Adrian Chase, I think she’s  going to come out of this asking some pretty tough questions about  herself and her moral decisions, and there’s a pretty big fight with  Oliver, too. How might this actually bring Oliver and Felicity closer? We’re also very excited about next week’s episode. We haven’t done a lot  of bottle [episodes], and this is one of the few that we’ve done. I  think it turned out so well. [Director] Wendey Stanzler hit it out of  the park. They’re stuck in a bunker together, and they’re not in a good  place. They’ve taken their individual paths, which is was exactly what  they wanted at the top of the season. They’ve gone down these different  roads. Oliver’s tries to pull her back from this brink and has failed.  All that fallout is going to happen right there in the bunker where they  have nowhere to run and there’s no escaping that conflict. And yet the sizzle trailer seems to indicate they’re on the road to reconciliation. Is that true? They are definitely on the road toward — well, the interesting thing  about taking her down this road with Helix is she is going to come out  of it with this, the same way Diggle came out of it when he killed his  brother — new understanding and appreciation for where Oliver’s been and  what he’s been through. No matter whether they end up together or not  (sorry, all Olicity Twitter fans), this is going to absolutely deepen  the relationship. It has to. She’s now gone through her own island in a  way. Speaking of Diggle, an upcoming episode features Diggle and Lyla dealing with some marital issues. What’s going on there? We’ve always wondered, ever since Lyla stepped up and took over  A.R.G.U.S., the interesting thing about her character is she, in a lot  of ways, is very similar to Oliver in that she’s now in the position of  making some really hard decisions and having to constantly justify the  means by the end. Dig’s going to find out about some of these things  that she’s been doing, and he’s going to really wonder where did his  wife go? It’s rich territory because they’ve always been such a solid  couple. They’ve had their ups and downs, but I think this is the first  time where Dig has looked at her and wondered that this person that he  sees in front of him doesn’t really resemble the person that he fell in  love with. That’s an interesting question for anyone in a marriage  situation to be asking themselves. It’s interesting because there was an episode where Diggle  and Dinah were working really closely together, and fans noticed  some chemistry between them. Does that play into this at all, or was  that just two good actors working off each other? It’s two great actors working off each other. [Laughs.] That  said, I think that part of the fun of having the team there is it’s  going to create theses different dynamics. If, down the road, there’s a  little misunderstanding here or there, I’m not saying that might not  happen. But right now, that’s not the case. With Chase still on the loose, how much danger is the team in? It’s safe to say, without teasing too much, they’re in the most danger they’ve ever been in. How will the team — most of whom are relatively new and have  not faced an ultimate showdown with a big bad before — deal with heading  into the final battle with Prometheus? Each character is going to have a different reaction to it. Dinah is  very much on the page of, “This guy just needs to be taken down.” Rene  is too, but he’s going to have other stakes; we’ve met his daughter  before in episode 513. The people who have potential for collateral  damage, if you will, the people with families who have more at stake are  going to have different attitudes about that. Everyone is going to be  on the same page of wanting to take this guy down. Nobody has really  been left unscathed by Adrian Chase. They’re going to be all in, and all  in in a way that newbies would be. There’s no doubt that Oliver is  going to have a much more profound sense of the dangers ahead, but by  the same token, he’s come to rely on this team and he needs them. Malcolm Merlyn popped up in the sizzle reel. What role will he be playing in these last episodes? Malcolm is going to be doing exactly what he’s always done. Part of the  fun of him is that you never know exactly where he stands. One thing  that is absolutely clear is he’s always there for Thea. He and Thea are  going to have some pretty cool scenes together because she’s going to  come back and he’s going to be there. She’s not happy to see him. Oliver  is going to be pulling at any possible help, whether he can trust that  help or not; he’s going to be calling in every reinforcement he has to  take down Chase. I think Josh Segarra has done an amazing job at really  making Chase one of the scariest villains that we’ve seen on the show. Are Oliver and Slade actually aligning then? That’s a great question. With Deathstroke, you never really know who  you’re dealing with, in a similar way with Malcolm, but with a little  bit more of an edge, because the history between Slade and Oliver is as  deep and troubled as the one between him and Malcolm. Slade is  definitely coming back. We’re definitely going to be thinking he might  be on Oliver’s side. That’s all I’m going to say about that, to quote  Forrest Gump. [Laughs.] What’s next for Thea? Thea is going to be going through a very similar emotional journey —  Oliver’s going to maybe arrive at his conclusion emotionally a little  bit sooner than she does, but it’s the same idea of really grappling.  The last time we saw her, she was going away to try to figure herself  out, because she had gone down this very Moira-esque road and started to  pull these antics that were really morally questionable. She sees that,  so when she comes back, it’s not going to be because she’s ready, it’s  going to be because she has to. She’s going to be working that out.  Eventually, she’s going to get to a place where she can put the past  behind her, but it’s going to be a pretty hard road for her. Will Oliver ever be able to operate as Green Arrow again? And  if not, what does that mean for the future of the show? Are we going to  see a new legacy for him? He’s questioning his legacy; he’s been doing it all season. The fact  that we’ve put the Green Arrow under the microscope to such an extent,  we are definitely setting some stuff up for season 6. We will definitely  see the Green Arrow again, but in what capacity? That’s a really good  question. That’s a premiere question.  Not a ton of new information, but a great kick off interview for the final 5 episodes. I am extremely excited for 5x19 and the deep dive into Felicity’s dark arc. I’m ready for them to turn up the heat on this storyline and really examine Felicity’s motivations. Plus… OLIVER AND FELICITY FIGHT! I AM ALIVE!!!!! We’ve waited a long time for this my friends. I like that they’ve addressed the Diggle/Dinah thing. I’ve noticed the chemistry between these two characters too. David and Julianna work great together. However, I don’t think they’ll go there. Dyla is the anchor. They are rock solid, so I’m glad that they alleviated any concerns that the marital issues are Dinah related. The ARGUS storyline for Dyla sounds more interesting to me anyway, and again, is something we’ve waited a long time for. I’m just happy Audrey is back in any capacity. Her availability is so limited I’m just thanking my lucky stars they snagged her for a few eps.I like the clue they gave about Oliver in relation to Thea. Oliver arrives at his emotional conclusion sooner than Thea does, which says to me that he heads into 5x23 somewhat resolved on the man he is - which is why he’ll be able to beat Prometheus. That should tie into the Olicity reunion as well, which makes me think my hunch about 5x22 might be correct. But we shall see.I like that Thea is still grappling, but I’m a little wary of the Malcolm Merlyn factor. We’ve hit this Thea/Malcolm note so many times before. I hope they are driving at new ground with Thea. If she’s moving along the same trajectory that Oliver is, which Wendy says they are, then I’m less concerned because she will arrive at the same conclusion as Oliver. It’s the new ground we’ve been waiting for. Essentially the entire cast has been in a holding pattern since 4x23, especially Thea, Oliver and Felicity, so it’ll be nice for these storylines to come to fruition.As for what Wendy said about Olicity ending the season together or not - please don’t freak. Like I always say, the EPs are never going to tell us the status of Olicity’s relationship in an article teasing the rest of the season. Just sit back, relax, watch and enjoy. I think they are going to be great." False link

This is the first group that she’s allowed herself to be vulnerable with. Oliver was the one who sought her out and let her in, so her connection to him in particular is a special one. She has a particular fondness for Oliver — not in a romantic way, but as a partner. And with Diggle, he’s the second in command, and that appeals to Dinah. She likes to sort of team up and go on runs with him. He’s a competent fighter and so is she.  “Not in a romantic way”Say it for the people in the back!!!!This was a really good interview, but that was my favorite part. Any and all BC/GA romantic storylines (whether it’s Din&h or Bl&ck Sir&n) have been shot down repeatedly. Olicity is the love story of Arrow. END OF DISCUSSION.This question also cracked me up -   TVLINE | Lastly, how do you feel your reception from the fans has been? They can be a pretty particular bunch, and yet I actually feel like they’re OK with you — which often can be the highest praise.  “A pretty particular bunch…” Who? Us? Never!Although I wouldn’t mind Dinah getting a romantic storyline. Maybe in Season 6." True link
