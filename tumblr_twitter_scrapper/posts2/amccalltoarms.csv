amccalltoarms 162759657569 "2017-07-08 22:06:05 GMT" https://amccalltoarms.tumblr.com/post/162759657569/dark-matter "I saw a woman in the park next to my AirBnB (in Toronto) on Wednesday who resembled my (abusive) ex and a wave of panic washed over me. Even though I knew it wasn’t her and she was still over 2,500 miles away - I felt like my shoulders had been ripped out of socket, my skin begin to crawl, and a sickness rotted in my gut. It was like watching ice crack - but inside of me. Both of my therapists and multiple mutual friends have been abundantly distinct that my ex intentionally (and repeatedly) lied to, maimed, manipulated, and gaslighted me. They remind me that she is toxic, narcissistic, faithless, manipulative, and abusive - and that she feels no remorse. Most days I can see that clearly. But healing from abuse isn’t linear, and there are days when I feel like I’m trapped in a straight jacket, and I can feel the noxious edges of her words and betrayal twisting in my intestines. And on those days I have to remember that love and healing are not additional knifes that I twist inside of myself. There are multiple symptoms of abuse that I continually have to identify as harmful, and toxic (for myself). This includes any remote connection to her, including friends/mutuals who have not identified her behavior as abusive/inexcusable. I haven’t had analytics on this blog (or my private one I made specifically for processing early on) for over 6 months, but I still have the impulse to install them again, weekly. I have a lot of impulses that are unhealthy/vengeful - the desire to lash out, hack her, to out her, to reblog all the things she promised and proclaimed publicly (and then deleted) - but they are just impulses. Early on, those impulses nearly qualified as needs. Lashing out felt as vital as breathing. Two weeks in my therapist told me “hatred is a normal response to this type of repeated infidelity/abuse”. And I didn’t understand what she meant by that, at first. Maybe it was because I still had a suspension of disbelief, I couldn’t fully grasp what was happening because it was so merciless. The only way I could process it was to tell myself that my ex was fully disassociating, because the truth, that she was strategically and purposefully maiming, manipulating, and gaslighting me (again) was too much to bear. I remember thinking that if I continued to speak to my ex in understanding and love that she would hear me, that she would “come back” to me like she did 3 years ago. Which was a mistake on my part, I should’ve walked out the door the second she started rewriting history. I should’ve turned around the moment she told me that “love wasn’t a choice” for her - and denied the physical evidence I had of her promising and claiming the opposite. I should’ve realized the moment that she purposefully violated my boundaries and blatantly lied to me about her plans that she wasn’t deluded or dissociating - she was purposefully re-opening the most intimate wounds she previously created. My therapist and two close (mutual) friends told me “she knew what and who would hurt you the most, her behavior was calculated”. I couldn’t see that at the time, all I knew is that nothing was making sense. I remember telling her that what she was saying directly conflicted with everything had ever written, said, and promised. That it went against everything I knew, what we had learned in couple’s counseling, and her own history and trauma. That I felt that she was intentionally doing and saying things to hurt me (she was). I often think about the evidence (and backups of her blogs) that I have, even though it’s locked away. About the countless binding, eternal (and public) solemn vows, promises and proclamations she made. I remember telling her “this is all I have left of you” holding on to the handwritten letters she had mailed me over the course of 5 years. I wonder sometimes if she overestimated her ability to dictate and control my reality, mainly because she was able to 3 years ago. I know she certainly tried, and when she failed - she maimed me, used guilt and shame to manipulate me, and cut all communication (the silent treatment is typical in situations of narcissistic/emotional abuse, and I’ve experienced all of these behaviors with her before). I know that she crazy-painted me to her friends, and attempted to use 3 of them to dictate/undermine my reality. I didn’t realize that she was using a group to manipulate me, until they started defending/justifying her behavior - and telling me that my anger/hurt was unwarranted. Being gaslighted by a group makes you feel like you’re losing your fucking mind. I remember presenting them with evidence of the trauma my ex was denying, the things she had written publicly, and they either dismissed or ignored it. I didn’t realize how toxic that circle was, and that the friends who had said “you two are meant to be”, “nothing can stop you guys, not even the apocalypse” would turn on me in an instant. Especially because they had personally witnessed the consequences of this same behavior 3 years ago. I don’t know what to call those people, because they certainly don’t qualify as friends. Every beautiful memory I have of her is tainted by her contempt, treachery, and abuse. There are days when I feel hate, vengeance, resentment, wrath, and animosity  - and I have to repeatedly perform something between emotional open heart surgery and archeology. I have to trace the root of those feelings and remind myself that I feel them because I was betrayed, lied to, gaslighted and maimed intimately - for the second time. I have to remind myself that she made our (healthy) mutual friends physically uncomfortable being in her presence. That they both told me they felt physically ill, and she made their skin crawl. That I didn’t even recognize her at the airport - and that I felt a physical hole in her over the course of those 4 days in November. I have to remind myself that both of my (female) therapists made faces of disgust regarding her language and behavior. I have to remind myself that I do not not want to be connected to anyone who can intentionally maim, gaslight, and crazy-paint the person they claimed to love most in the world, twice - and not feel an ounce of remorse. But mostly I remind myself that I do not have any magical thinking, that I do not wish for her return, another time-line, or the path not taken. I wouldn’t trade places with another version of me in another life because it wouldn’t be my life. I don’t know how many more times I’ll break down in public, or have a panic attack in a bathroom stall, or how many more times I’ll throw up in the shower. But I know that when I want to self-harm I don’t have to (because I haven’t, once). I do not not need to out her because she’s doing that herself. I know that she did her worst - and she could not break me. I know that I can (and have) let go of that anger, continuously. I know that I can pull every knife out of my own back without twisting or using them to gut myself. I do not need to look her up, or make contact, even in the remotest sense.I know that any desire for catharsis or contact with her is a symptom of the abuse. I know that the person I thought I knew (even intimately - for years) is gone. I know that the extremities of her behavior and language have absolutely nothing to do with me. I do not concern myself with whatever lies she’s spread, or how she’s painted me. I am grounded, my feet are firmly planted in truth, evidence, and professional behavioral assessments - and everyone who knows me knows exactly what we’re both made of. I do not wish her well, or harm. I only wish to be and break free. " True text

I mean, how does one convey the complexities of emotional abuse to someone who has not experienced the cruelty of being intentionally and intimately maimed (for the second time) by the person who publicly claimed, for years, to love you most in the world? To have that person gaslight you, rewrite your combined history and deny, or delete/destroy every shred of (overwhelming) evidence of the things they confessed, promised, and swore on their life? I would liken it to having all your joints dislocated and then being strapped into a straight jacket for six months. Or having someone shove glass down your throat and then duct-taping your mouth over, forcing you to swallow - fully knowing the damage it’ll do because they’ve done it before. Or to have that person purposefully re-open the deepest, most intimate wounds they inflicted - and then crazy paint and stigmatize you?Words don’t come out when you’ve been hurt that deeply. It’s hard to convey that level of emotional and psychological violence. The effects of infidelity (with the intent to maim), emotional abuse (especially gaslighting) are lasting. It is legitimate trauma. I threw up every day for the first eight weeks and lost over 25lbs from starving myself over those first two months. I lost any and every remote desire for intimacy, I recoiled at any and every touch. I still do. I cry nearly every time I drive. Anger still washes over me at times, along with waves of wrath. I still find myself punching my steering wheel in abandoned parking lots, or screaming (“FAITHLESS!”) into my pillow every other week. I know, that’s progress, but it certainly doesn’t feel that way when you’re in the middle of it all.While she was unable to dictate my reality, she was still able to maim me, manipulate me, and gaslight me (to an extent). I know she wanted me to lash out so she could justify her behavior, which I didn’t do once. But that also doesn’t mean I have to stay silent either. An important lesson I’ve learned (this time around) is that abusive words lose their power when we make them known to others. When I told (and showed) my therapists the language my ex used to gaslight me (both times), they both made immediate faces of disgust - with no attempt to hide their reaction. My EMDR therapist literally spit out her water and said, “what the actual fuck.’ And my behavioral therapist said, ""you realize how insane/manipulative that language is, right?” (I do btw).When I showed/told that language to (trusted) friends, they all had similar responses. One mutual friend said, “Jesus Christ, I just said that out loud. She’s trying to rewrite history to justify her behavior.” Another said, “Troy, she’s a liar. She’s fucking cruel and abusive.” And when my ex went out of her way to “passively” manipulate me weeks later I made her actions known to people I trusted, and they told me “That makes me so angry. What kind of person does that?”Which is a question I’ve repeatedly had to ask myself.A dear friend of mine asked me back in January “is that (her intentional abusive behavior, narcissism, contempt, utter betrayal, and complete lack of remorse) something you want to subscribe to?” And I knew deep down then, just like I know now - my answer was, is, and forever will be “no.”I do not want to subscribe to that, much less be attached to it. Love is not a knife I use to twist inside myself. Part of the acceptance piece is realizing that she is not the person I believed (and knew) her to be. Nor is she the person that others thought she was, or who she publicly claimed (and promised) to be for years. I know that no amount of evidence will ever bring that version of her back, and with time - the more I realize that the woman I thought I knew never really existed at all. No matter how real that version seemed to me. She/it was mimicked. If it was real she wouldn’t have done the very thing that she repeatedly swore on her life she’d never to do again, much less in the exact same manner. I know a crucial part of healing from emotional abuse (at least for me) is letting go of that “you didn’t know them like I did” way of thinking. Still, how do you let that go without doubting your instincts and judgment? I haven’t quite figured that out yet, other than knowing my instincts were right leading up to that abuse, and they were right in the midst of it. I knew I was being lied to, manipulated, and maimed - intentionally. But part of her act is believing (and seemingly being utterly convinced of) the lies that she tells. And I fell for that. She knew, based on our couple’s counseling sessions, that I wouldn’t negate her reality, especially if I believed she was deluded and dissociative. All she had to do was convince herself of the lies she was telling - and I wouldn’t call her a liar (even though I told her those things weren’t true, and directly conflicted with everything she had ever said to me, written, blogged, and confessed during couple’s counseling).A mutual friend also told me “She has no interest in authenticity. She doesn’t have any of the qualities or characteristics that you have. I was physically uncomfortable in her presence.” And my therapists have made it very clear what she is and isn’t capable of (due to her pathology).I’m still wrapping my head around that. Maybe I’ll never be able to fully. It seemed so authentic in the moment. She seemed so real (for a time). But I can trust those friends and my therapists. I know it was infidelity and abuse because I was definitively told that by two mental health professionals.  I can trust Bell Hooks, Erich Fromm, Brene Brown, Esther Perel, Andrea Gibson, and Lundy Bancroft.I can trust that nothing beautiful, holy, or divine can come from someone who behaves narcissistically and abusively. I can trust that love can’t exist in someone who betrayed everything they swore on their life and shows no remorse for their actions. And I can trust that she’s never going to hear anyone, much less god say “Good job, you’re finally not full of bullshit” again.My behavioral therapist told me yesterday: “There are two options, either she lied about that trauma and experience to you, me, her therapists, her friends, and publicly on her blog for two and half years and faked those dozens of panic attacks and shame spirals - or she’s lying now. Either way - she lied.”All the magic I thought she held was only a reflection. All she has left are curses and maledictions that can no longer hurt me. She can no longer hurt me. I am no longer under her spell. Words lose all their power when they are based in duplicity. I used to wonder what I was made of, and she used to tell me that I was composed of starlight. And I’m beginning to see it break through the cracks and rips of this straightjacket, in my backyard, with the fireflies. I can see it in the mirror when I wake up before dawn. I can see it in my rearview mirror through my tears when I drive at night. It’s been said that grief doesn’t change you, it reveals you; I think it’s a combination, but then again - grief, abuse, and infidelity aren’t the same things. I might not be where I want to be, but I am who I want (and claimed) to be. I’ll get to where I’m going soon enough. The tickets are already booked." True text

Reading this got me thinking about not just why I got sober (obviously my life had become unmanageable), but why I started using in the first place. I became physically dependent on (addicted to) Oxycontin at the age of 19, after compound fracturing my tailbone (due to a skating incident) and having multiple spinal fusions/surgeries. My habit didn’t start because I was a “rebel”, or because I was experimenting around with drugs in college. I’m literally a medical statistic: (1 out of 5 patients that are prescribed opioids for 10 days become long-term users). I didn’t drink until my 21st birthday (seriously). Of course, I was a pill-head by that point - but I was still obtaining everything legally (and continued to until I was 23). The problem, for me, wasn’t just the physical dependence and being in chronic pain - it’s that oxy (and later - fentanyl) worked better at treating my depression and anxiety than any of the psychiatric medication I had been prescribed.  Simply, I never “chased the rabbit”, or “enjoyed” the bliss. I used because when I was high - I wasn’t severely depressed/suicidal. And instead of developing (healthy) coping mechanisms and emotionally maturing - I became dependent on that drug to deal any type of emotional stress/trauma. It eliminated my depression, so why not use it for other (extreme) emotional duress?  Anxiety over grad school/work? Use. Lonely? Use. Feel guilt/shame? Use. And when the drugs ran out? Drink.The problem, of course - is that I eventually reached the point where I didn’t know how to cope (with anything) without using/drinking. I was, what is referred to as “a high functioning addict/alcoholic”: Triple Majored, worked for a Fortune 500 Company, was charming/athletic. And until I was 25, there weren’t any physical symptoms. I knew I had a problem, and I knew how to hide it, because I felt entitled to it. Not because I enjoyed it - because I needed it to survive - just to get through the day. I even ran (and placed in) two marathons in 2009 (a year before I ODed) just to purposefully throw people off the “he might have a problem” scent. Everything I did from ages 19-25 was strictly by design. I can look back and recognize the exact moment I pushed someone away, or burned a bridge because I felt that they were getting close enough to “find out” that deep-down, I was a fraud. I remember waking up a couple weeks before I ODed in my ex’s bathtub - completely naked, covered in tiny scrapes and nicks, and a soaked towel draped over me - not knowing how I got there, or even having any memory of the last 10-12hrs. Dried blood caking my nose. Looking in that bathroom mirror - where I used to watch her dry her hair in the mornings - not even recognizing the person staring back at me. Looking at myself and saying “How the fuck did I get here?” But not “How did I physically end up in this bathroom?”, I meant “How the fuck did I get here in a cosmic, incorporeal, metaphysical sense? Why the fuck am I here at all? What have I become? I don’t know who that person is in that reflection.”And realizing I didn’t know who I was - outside of my job, outside of GPA, outside of my GRE score, outside of the mind-games and manipulation tactics, outside of the need to use to feel normal - that’s what lead me to get sober. The day after I ODed - I got dropped off at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting wearing hospital socks - the doctor’s words reverberating off the walls in my brain: “if you don’t stop using you won’t live to see 26, much less 30″, and that’s certainly was part of why I haven’t used since. But mostly it’s because, deep-down, I truly don’t want to. The person who needs to use/drink in order to cope is the weakest/smallest version of me. And I haven’t been that person in a very long time. The only thing that ever stopped me was fear. Not of failure.

If the relationship breaks down, the sponsored spouse’s permanent residency can be revoked. Spouses holding conditional permanent resident status enjoy the same rights and benefits as any other permanent resident.  Continue Reading.  Good news for me in case Trump wins" False link

At the beginning of our “educational” phase of learning, topics need to be engaging. Invoking emotion, humor, or whatever rhetorical trick is available to convince the student/pupil is seemingly worthwhile. Provided that the trick is a way of simplifying a complex subject - not a lie, or a way of controlling the student’s beliefs, or thoughts.In college, education *can* be engaging while remaining intellectually honest and devoid of (outright) appeals to emotion. I know this might seem like a rare case, but if you’re lucky enough to have a professor who treated you like a peer, you know how much of an impact being respected for your own ideas can make - and how it can set you on the path to who you later become.When education becomes about *how* to think and not *what* to think, it is inherently more compelling. I remember the (moral) philosophy and ethics classes I took as an undergrad; and they were the most engaging classes I ever took precisely because they challenged everything I thought I knew. Those professors could have spent the time teaching me what to think (e.g. just what the major moral philosophy theories are) but instead they used a (somewhat) socratic method and challenged us (each class) about what we already believed and how philosophers like Kant, Nietzsche, & Kierkegaard came to their own theories.Of course, intellectual and moral relativism are dangerous subjects because they require coming to knowledge/truth (an epistemology) that no one else has access to and/or that relies on subjective evidence (i.e. emotions/feelings).Still, I don’t believe (higher) education is the enemy here. In Graduate School (for instance), when you hit the frontier of your field - you start thinking about problems no one ever thought about. You start thinking about solutions to the problem no-one else has thought about. Stylized dry writing is easer to evaluate for correctness. You don’t want an emotional investment (despite how personal the subject is), you want to convey an objective view so it can be picked apart based on its own merits. If that stands up, seems correct, or at least worth more investigation, then it can be dressed up in the easy to communicate way.However, some ideas can’t be evaluated (at all) without investing in their emotional content. That’s a difficult place to find truth. Perhaps that’s why art, and - in turn, why media exists.While I believe (popular) media (especially books) can communicate thoughts and questions that academia is incapable of, I don’t think you’re going to discover the answer to life’s questions by watching a Taylor Swift music video on Youtube. But who’s to say really? Is “Breaking Bad” really just a story about meth, or is it an existential moral conflict? Is “Mr. Robot” just a story about NY Hackers, or is it a compelling descent into madness? Is “Out of the Woods” the catchiest song ever written, or is it about the possibility of an unperceived existence? (That’s a “If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?” joke).I guess that depends on who you are.PS: I don’t think the Guardian gets Nietzsche." True link

I feel like my life is closing in around me, like there’s a dark cloud hanging over everything and slowly enveloping me in a kind of blurry panic. It’s staining everything I see and making it harder and harder for me to notice the good things when I’m surrounded by so many bad vibes. How do I make my way through this? How do I see in the dark?Help,Losing My LightDear Losing My Light,Sometimes a dark time isn’t necessarily a bad time. What you’re experiencing is a transition, the end of one chapter of life and the beginning of a new one. As the sun sets and night falls, we can feel a sense of loss — longing for the warmth and brightness of the day, when we could see things clearly and take comfort in the security of life at its most illuminated and transparent. But only a fool would expect the day to last forever, and even the longest day must eventually come to a close. The wise person learns not only to accept this transition, but to appreciate it — to see the night and its darkness as an absolute necessity, a natural companion to the day and its brilliance.We must not mistake the experience of darkness as a sign of torturous death or the end of all good things. It is just a turning point, a part of a cycle. And once the darkness has completed its part of the pattern, the shadows will retreat, the sun will rise, and the light will return once more. We must be able to accept and love the cycles of life, and learn to recognize these signs of transition as part of the ever-unfolding and developing nature of life.The best thing we can do is use these moments of darkness to rejuvenate and recover our strength, to absorb and grow and prepare ourselves for what comes when the light returns. Do not be afraid of the dark. Do not resent it, and do not seek to artificially illuminate yourself out of desperation. Much like the body wants rest and recuperation during a good night’s sleep, the soul and spirit needs to slumber in these moments of transitory twilight. It needs to succumb to the natural spiraling movement between light and dark, positive and negative, something and nothing. It’s in this space that we come into form; in this space, we hover between being and becoming. This is what life is, and to fight it is futile and counterproductive.Learning how to allow oneself the space to simply exist is one of the great lessons life can teach us. And it is during these moments of darkness that we sometimes have no other choice but to simply…live. Because it is in that nonjudgmental and non-panicked state of calm acceptance that we can see the dark and the light for what they truly are: both part of one beautiful pulse. Take a light switch, for instance: It must be in the on or off position; it can never be both. Inhale, and exhale. You can’t hold your breath forever or not breathe at all. It’s the back-and-forth of existence that allows us to exist at all.Most of all, don’t lose hope. Don’t close your heart or make drastic decisions out of desperation. Just know that you are going through these natural ebbs and flows in life, and they’re an absolutely necessary aspect of being a person. Sometimes the pain we feel is simply the discomfort of growing. Sometimes the darkness is just a shadow cast by a beautiful and radiant light. Sometimes our hardest moments will reveal themselves to be the most rewarding and important experiences of all.Stay strong and remember that you are the light that will continuously see you through all the challenges and darkness you encounter. The shadows aren’t always bad. Sometimes they’re just the result of so much light around the corner.Your friend,Andrew W.K." True link

You simply don’t know enough to be doing this, and in doing so, you are hurting people’s perspective of the industry.”Jamie and I eye-rolled when we saw the above article, but realised it may be a good opportunity to talk about this stuff, as it happens a lot, for a lot of books. I meant to write it back in may, but I got distracted by working myself to death. However, I appear to have a few minutes spare, and as there’s a lot of comics economics talk going around in the last few days, it strikes me as a good time to throw this into the mix.In August 2006, the month that our first issue of Phonogram launched, the Walking Dead’s sales figures were estimated at 20,501.I can tell you, this wasn’t a failure or a cause of concern. Every single creator envied Kirkman and Allard. In the same month, Invincible’s sales were estimated as 13,584. Maybe that was a cause for concern? It’s basically 2/3rds of Walking Dead. It’s well beneath the line Marvel would cancel a book.No, it wasn’t a cause for concern. Almost every Image Creator would have also killed for those numbers.Walking Dead then wasn’t what Walking Dead is now, but it was still the book which set the conversation in terms of what Indie books were capable of. That Kirkman had his name on two books with that level of success made him the go-to example of how to indie comics. No, I don’t mean “hey, you get to do your own thing and make some money.” I mean “you are doing financially better than you would by doing a WFH book for the big two.”I’ll give you some really basic rule of thumbs for indie comic commentary:Anything selling stably over 10k in single issues is a cause for celebration and joy. The creators are almost certainly extremely happy.If you’re selling over (ooh) 12k, you’re probably making more than either of the big two would pay you, unless you’re one of the very biggest names.If you’re selling anything near 20k, you probably have to buy drinks for your friends.And in a real way, if Phonogram settled around 6k back in 2006, I suspect Jamie and I would have settled into doing it for another 40 or 50 issues.There’s all manner of exceptions to the above, but if you look at the charts and bear that in mind, you’ll be closer to how the industry looks at those numbers.None of the above includes digital sales. None of the above include trades. You throw trades in, and you change everything entirely. A cursory look at hit indie comic numbers reveals that their trades sell much more than Marvel/DC main universe trades, with a few exceptions (There’s a reason why Matt and David’s Hawkeye was such a big thing, and it wasn’t its monthly sales). Let’s bold another sentence.You cannot do an industry commentary column on indie books without including  the impact of trades.There are books that are selling well beneath 10k and are doing just fine.All the three sentences I bolded in a block were about making  money from the single issues. They do not include any other revenue source, such as trades. If the single issues break even and you make your money in trades, that’s also fine. With a few exceptions, big two comics primarily make their money in single issues. That is one reason why their single issue sales matter so much more.There’s other reasons why single issue sales need to be higher…Overheads. They have more editors staff, etc. What a creator owned book makes, generally speaking, a creator owned book keeps. The overheads are lower.Profit targets. Books don’t just need to be profitable. They need to be profitable to a level which has been corporately pre-determined, in a set period of time. A relatively low selling book is taking the place of a book which could abstractly sell higher. Why keep a book which sells 18k on the shelf when you could have one which sells more?All those factors interacting are amongst the reasons why the bar is higher for a monthly audience at the big two.Equally, it would be a mistake to confuse the audience of a book with its monthly sales. As said above, you would have to include a trades for that, and the trades are not a small thing. On a personal level, we’ve sold over 50,000 copies of the first WicDiv Trade. Last I looked at Amazon’s stats we were selling about 1000 a month via book shops alone (i.e. not including comic shops, which is usually more.) The orders for 12 were 22k. The initial orders of the second trade are up 33% on the first trade. Realistically, we were hoping to stabilise at around 13k, and we’d have been enormously happy with that, even if we weren’t selling trades. Which we are. WicDiv is a ludicrous success, by far the biggest thing in our entire career. And thanks to everyone’s support in achieving that. The idea that there’s articles being written which try and frame discussion of indie comics like this - and it’s an approach which is picked up by comment threads - is entirely counter to the reality of the comics industry. " False link

Every time a clearly mentally ill person commits a crime, and someone says, “Hey, maybe this is a sign that we need to improve mental health awareness in this country,” everyone goes to screaming: “This isn’t about mental illness! Mentally ill people aren’t violent!”But yes, sometimes mentally ill people are violent. Sometimes we are bad people.
