But this list got longer  Jesus…  • Native Americans had to register to become American • Black Panthers once watched over the police to prevent unjust arrests and beatings • Native American children were massively murdered when schools got too full • Black people were in zoos • There were Asian concentration camps during WW2  *The World’s largest Great White shark ever recorded in history fed off of slaves thrown over the ships*Gay white plantation owners used to rape the slave men in front of the slave’s wives, children, and friends. They used this method to deter the slaves from revolting or any other unwanted acts. *Plantation owner would make a “deal” with the hardest working male slave to bore 10 children and he will be set free. Creating the stereotype of black men leaving and abandoning their children.*Harriet Tubman’s first husband, a freed man, tried to discourage Harriet’s mission to free as many slaves as she could he threatening to tell her over.  We were taught that about Abe but this is some important info  Male slaves would have their teeth removed - the front two to mark them as slaves if they escaped and the back ones for sale one of the reasons for landowners to back the revolution was that England had abolished slavery and wanted to bring it across to the colonies - one hundred years before slavery was abolished the US has been responsible for almost every major conflict of the last one hundred years and interfered in the others almost always for drugs or oil the great depression was entirely caused by the newly developed aggro farming of the 1920s the US accidentally sank several ships of Jewish refugees in WW2 including one mostly full of children  •in Africa the white men that were there to “collect” the slaves would give tribes guns. This was in order to have tribes turn against each other so the “weak” tribe members would be sent to America. •During the Armenian Genocide, families would potentially be spared if the oldest daughter had her face and arms tattooed with blue X’s. These blue X’s signified that the Turkish soldiers could do anything they wanted to her. [I met a woman that this happened to, while she ended up having a husband and children and had some sort of happiness in life. It was hard to look at her. Not because of the X’s but by what happened to her because they were there.]  *Southern black people were convicted of “crimes” (walking by the railroad, looking a certain way) after slavery had been abolished and forced to do hard labor like working in mines for weeks without seeing the sun where they had to drink stagnant water sitting at the bottom of the mines, being whipped and killed if they ran away. A lot of black people were put in jail during the cotton season when men, women, and children were whipped and killed while working in the fields. *Southern black people were enslaved in this same time period (after slavery was abolished) through imaginary debt that white people claimed that they had and they couldn’t pay it back because the person that they were “indebted” to set all the terms. *The literally “Constitution” of the Confederacy says that the point of their nation is slavery.  Don’t listen to people who say its about states rights. *A lot of Republicans switched from being Democrats bc of the integrated military, the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts because they didn’t want to vote in the same party as black people. The literal founding of their party is racism.  because this has gotten longer  - Native children were rounded up by white people and put into boarding schools where most of them were brutally beaten and raped repeatedly while also being banned from seeing their parents ever again. - White men would rape their way into native bloodlines just so they could be “legally entitled” to land, money and livestock that was reserved for natives. -Native reservations were purposely established in places that were uninhabitable (i.e. poor soil, sparse food & water etc.) This was a way of forcing assimilation. -Many cultures of PoC recognized more than just 2 genders before white supremacy came in with that basic shit. -Ghandi also beat his wife -America has a very long history of wartime sexual violence  Dear God " False text
