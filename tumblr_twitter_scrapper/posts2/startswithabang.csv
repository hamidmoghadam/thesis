Someone villainous actor can club the truth over the back of the head with a folding chair, but when the scrupulous hero goes to pick up the folding chair, the referee notices. The hero gets disqualified. And suddenly the villain is victorious. This is what I object to. This is what I resent. You may not see this happening but I do, and many others do as well. Not just with something where there isn’t a nefarious actor like the EmDrive, but when there’s over fraud involved. You may object to the “make a law” route, and claim it’s unconstitutional, and I don’t enough know about such matters to evaluate that one way or the other; I have to defer to someone with more expertise. So then the challenge is this: how do we change the way business-as-usual is done to value the correct information of a valid expert over the gain-motivated misinformation of a fraudster?”There has been an incredible roundup of scientific news from this year’s annual AAS meeting, and we’ve taken on an entire slew of amazing stories. I may be in the SLC airport, unable to upload images, edit articles or post links very well, but we’re doing our damnedest to deliver the best stories plus our weekly dose of bonus science to you.

Am I right to assume that the speed of light is also the speed of causality (how fast things lead to one another in the universe) and that no matter what I do, the last domino will fall at best one year after the first?”The speed of light is usually thought of as a speed limit for how fast an object can travel, but you’re right to also think of it as a speed limit on the transfer of information.  If you want an object to influence another object, you first have to transfer some information around.  In the case of light, this influence can come in the form of… Read the full article on Forbes!

Each year, the website “3 Quarks Daily” holds a science writing contest where anyone can nominate any piece of science writing (including their own) and they not only give out awards, they include cash prizes for the writers.Some of my favorites (not counting myself) this past year include Natalie Wolchover at Quanta Magazine, many different writers at Nautilus including Lee Billings and Julia Rosen, some great stories at Aeon by authors such as Sarah Scoles and Ross Andersen, and an emerging set of outstanding stories on Forbes Science, among many other independent writers and bloggers like Sabine Hossenfelder, Paul Halpern, Jillian Scudder and Brian Koberlein.Go here – http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2015/09/nick-lane-to-judge-6th-annual-3qd-science-prize.html – and nominate your favorites!"
