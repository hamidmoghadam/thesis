It’s just so tiring. Acknowledge where they can do better, but give yourself a break for the things you like. No one is perfect and you can like things that aren’t perfect.  Boom, there it is.  All-or-nothing thinking is so draining and toxic. It’s okay to say “I’m aware of x, y, and z, but I really like a, b, and c.” It’s okay to have a multi-faceted, nuanced understanding of the people and things around you.   I just can’t get behind the whole “this person said/did this one bad thing this one time, therefore they are literal human trash #deleted forever bye!” all-or-nothing cultureit’s toxic and it’s draining, and it puts people in the awful position of being a hair’s breadth from “unproblematic fave” to “garbage person” with zero possibility of being allowed to grow or changethis kind of all-or-nothing thinking is *exhausting*. people fuck up. people grow. people make mistakes and sometimes say imperfect things and sometimes act shitty. people can also learn and change and move onbut it takes grace and compassion  NEWSFLASH: you don’t have to agree with everything a celebrity does/says!!"

This “Bughead” relationship, is something to root for in 2017 at last.Everyone who ever wanted the girl next door to forgo her crush on the jock and see the sensitive guy in the corner should be jumping for joy right now.  The fact that all of the characters involved are more layered than that, and Jughead never pined or fit into a problematic “nice guy” stereotype is also great. Plus, they make a really good team — something I always look for in my favorite ‘ships. Honestly, Betty and Jughead as a simple and straightforward couple is the fantasy these days. They’re not ghosting each other via text message. They don’t hide their emotions behind a wall of fear and three levels of irony. Both of them have demons and angst like any self-respecting teen, but not when it comes to each other. We should value this kind of romantic sincerity! Keep it safe! " False link
