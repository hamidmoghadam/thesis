You‚Äôve got a pretty good chance the officer who shows up helps out in a meaningful way.

Not so much in the station. Generally speaking (and I know this is oversimplification and is worse in a lot of places but), it went like this:  On the street, you were considered as a person/citizen they have sworn to protect who may have made a mistake or done something wrong. Once you were in the station, you were considered as a criminal. In the station you are the only one on your side. Stay safe.  TV and film has you thinking that only guilty people ask for a lawyer. This is not true. The law is complex and difficult and confusing and if you‚Äôre being questioned by the police you‚Äôre not going to be in your best state of mind. A lawyer is your basic civil right and you should exercise that right. Keep silent, ask for a lawyer, take your legal advice. Guilty people don‚Äôt ask for a lawyer, smart people do.  ‚ÄúGuilty people don‚Äôt ask for a lawyer, smart people do.‚Äù  My uncle was a cop.

My friend tells it so well, and I can offer only a pale shadow of his story. Last summer, he was working with one of the younger units comprised of ten year old boys. They had spent the night camping on another beach and were just readying themselves to depart. ‚ÄúMake sure you have all your things!‚Äù called my friend. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt leave anything behind!‚Äù One small boy came up, dragging a massive tangle of decomposing seaweed behind him. ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ what about me boy?‚Äù he asked, lip trembling. ‚Äú‚Ä¶what is ‚Äòme boy‚Äô?‚Äù The child held up the stinking wad of bull kelp. ‚ÄúThis is him. This is Me Boy.‚Äù ‚ÄúMe Boy is not coming back with us,‚Äù said his counselor. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to leave Me Boy behind on the beach where he belongs.‚Äù The campers loudly mourned the loss of Me Boy. They insisted on giving him a Viking burial at sea, which just consisted of pushing him solemnly off the back of the rowboat into the water and watching him drift away in the surf. That was only the beginning. Me Boy would be back. The campers, in true camp fashion, possessed some kind of cultic hive-mind and a predisposition for bizarre memes. Me Boy would not be forgotten. They started telling each other stories about Me Boy and how he would one day rise again. There were warring factions with contradicting dogmas about Me Boy. Only when the gardener allowed them to take home a zucchini she had harvested did they find their god, born anew.  Me Boy, The Zucchini That Was A God, became the whole unit‚Äôs mascot. The kids would bicker over who got to carry him. They built nests and carriers for Me Boy and brought him to different activities, fiercely defending him from those that would do him harm. One child appointed himself the Voice of Me Boy and would translate the zucchini‚Äôs divine wishes into human speech.  It got out of hand. Me Boy had become a distraction, a fixation, a violent controversy. Something had to be done. My friend, their counselor, took it upon himself to kill Me Boy. The children wailed in despair as he chopped their God into refreshing slices. With this sudden turn of fortune, followers of Me Boy turned to theophagy. ‚ÄúWe must eat him to preserve his power!‚Äù they cried. Boys who would otherwise never have touched a vegetable ate greedily of this sacrament, eager to let Me Boy live on within them. For a time, it seemed that peace and order had been restored, and the religion had already faded into its silver age. But only for a time. In the last few days of camp, the religion of Me Boy splintered into several denominations. Every meal yielded new vegetable matter said to be a reincarnation of Me Boy, only for opposing groups to dismiss these as false prophets. Some believed that Me Boy was gone. Others believed his spirit lived on, intangible, omnipresent. Some believed he had found a new vessel inside a carrot, a pear, a slice of cantaloupe‚Ä¶ even inside a child. There was chaos, and strife, and heartbreak without the guidance of Me Boy.  The tags on this post are very polarized. Half of them are¬†‚Äú#I‚Äôm glad I never went to camp‚Äù and¬†‚Äú#reasons why I never want kids‚Äù, the other half are¬†‚Äú#BOY I LOVE CHILDREN CAMP IS SO GOOD AMIRIGHT?‚Äù " False text

Funnily enough, their politics are so downright awful that in order to get their ideal policies through they have to pander to CONSERVATIVES, often far right ones, who are pretty authoritarian funnily enough.  If you support the Koch Bros you support media manipulation, government corruption, intimidation of journalists, deadly business practices (literally), backing far-right regimes, and overall an ideology that is quite literally killing people in the name of profit.

The meeting was also attended by his campaign chairman at the time, Paul J. Manafort, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Mr. Manafort and Mr. Kushner only recently disclosed the meeting, though not its content, in confidential government documents described to The New York Times. The Times reported the existence of the meeting on Saturday. But in subsequent interviews, the advisers and others revealed the motivation behind it. The meeting ‚Äî at Trump Tower on June 9, 2016, two weeks after Donald J. Trump clinched the Republican nomination ‚Äî points to the central question in federal investigations of the Kremlin‚Äôs meddling in the presidential election: whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians. The accounts of the meeting represent the first public indication that at least some in the campaign were willing to accept Russian help. And while President Trump has been dogged by revelations of undisclosed meetings between his associates and the Russians, the episode at Trump Tower is the first such confirmed private meeting involving members of his inner circle during the campaign ‚Äî as well as the first one known to have included his eldest son. It came at an inflection point in the campaign, when Donald Trump Jr., who served as an adviser and a surrogate, was ascendant and Mr. Manafort was consolidating power. It is unclear whether the Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, actually produced the promised compromising information about Mrs. Clinton. But the people interviewed by The Times about the meeting said the expectation was that she would do so. In a statement on Sunday, Donald Trump Jr. said he had met with the Russian lawyer at the request of an acquaintance. ‚ÄúAfter pleasantries were exchanged,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthe woman stated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Ms. Clinton. Her statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense. No details or supporting information was provided or even offered. It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information.‚Äù He said she then turned the conversation to adoption of Russian children and the Magnitsky Act, an American law that blacklists suspected Russian human rights abusers. The law so enraged Mr. Putin that he retaliated by halting American adoptions of Russian children. ‚ÄúIt became clear to me that this was the true agenda all along and that the claims of potentially helpful information were a pretext for the meeting.‚Äù Mr. Trump said. When he was first asked about the meeting on Saturday, he said only that it was primarily about adoptions and mentioned nothing about Mrs. Clinton. Mark Corallo, a spokesman for the president‚Äôs lawyer, said on Sunday that ‚Äúthe president was not aware of and did not attend the meeting.‚Äù Lawyers and spokesmen for Mr. Kushner and Mr. Manafort did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In his statement, Donald Trump Jr. said he asked Mr. Manafort and Mr. Kushner to attend, but did not tell them what the meeting was about. American intelligence agencies have concluded that Russian hackers and propagandists worked to tip the election toward Mr. Trump, in part by stealing and then providing to WikiLeaks internal Democratic Party and Clinton campaign emails that were embarrassing to Mrs. Clinton. WikiLeaks began releasing the material on July 22. A special prosecutor and congressional committees are now investigating the Trump campaign‚Äôs possible collusion with the Russians. Mr. Trump has disputed that, but the investigation has cast a shadow over his administration. [‚Ä¶] Since the president took office, Donald Trump Jr. and his brother Eric have assumed day-to-day control of their father‚Äôs real estate empire. Because he does not serve in the administration and does not have a security clearance, Donald Trump Jr. was not required to disclose his foreign contacts. Federal and congressional investigators have not publicly asked for any records that would require his disclosure of Russian contacts. Ms. Veselnitskaya is a formidable operator with a history of pushing the Kremlin‚Äôs agenda. Most notable is her campaign against the Magnitsky Act, which provoked a Cold War-style, tit-for-tat dispute with the Kremlin when President Barack Obama signed it into law in 2012. Under the law, some 44 Russian citizens have been put on a list that allows the United States to seize their American assets and deny them visas. The United States asserts that many of them are connected to the fraud exposed by Mr. Magnitsky, who after being jailed for more than a year was found dead in his cell. A Russian human rights panel found that he had been assaulted. To critics of Mr. Putin, Mr. Magnitsky, in death, became a symbol of corruption and brutality in the Russian state. An infuriated Mr. Putin has called the law an ‚Äúoutrageous act,‚Äù and, in addition to banning American adoptions, he compiled what became known as an ‚Äúanti-Magnitsky‚Äù blacklist of United States citizens. Among those blacklisted was Preet Bharara, then the United States attorney in Manhattan, who led notable convictions of Russian arms and drug dealers. Mr. Bharara was abruptly fired in March, after previously being asked to stay on by Mr. Trump.  " False link

Bernie Sanders is, by some measures the most popular politician in America, by far Democrats‚Äô most in-demand public speaker, and the most prolific grassroots fundraiser in American history.If he were 10 or 20 years younger, his absence from a 2020 cattle call held by the Center for American Progress back in May would have been glaring. As things stood, the whisper among everyone in the halls was simply that he‚Äôs too old and obviously won‚Äôt run.But make no mistake: Sanders is the real 2020 Democratic frontrunner.He‚Äôs doing exactly what a candidate who fell short needs to do to run a second time. He‚Äôs established a national political organization, he‚Äôs improved his ties with colleagues on Capitol Hill, he‚Äôs maintained a heavy presence in national media, and he‚Äôs traveling the country talking about issues.In subtle ways he‚Äôs shifted his policy commitments to the center, making himself a more broadly acceptable figure in the party. At the same time, he‚Äôs held on to a couple of signature issues ‚Äî Medicare-for-all and tuition-free public college ‚Äî that give him exactly the kind of clear-cut and broadly accessible agenda that mainstream Democrats lack.Of course, if he were to run and win, he‚Äôd be 78 years old, the oldest president on record by some margin. And maybe he won‚Äôt run. But his recent moves suggest that he is both interested in the nomination and very much the candidate to beat for it.Nobody thought Bernie Sanders could winBy the time it was clear the Sanders 2016 campaign had legs, it was already fatally hobbled. Almost no one believed in the summer and fall of 2015 that he stood any chance of beating Hillary Clinton ‚Äî and that included Sanders himself. As Patrick Healy and Yamiche Alcindor reported last April, he ‚Äúwas originally skeptical that he could beat Mrs. Clinton, and his mission in 2015 was to spread his political message about a rigged America rather than do whatever it took to win the nomination‚Äù and only began to really focus on trying to win when his poll numbers unexpectedly soared in early 2016.Consequently, labor leaders who sympathized with Sanders‚Äôs critique of Clinton didn‚Äôt give any serious thought to actually endorsing him. Instead, they used his presence in the race as leverage to extract concessions on issues like the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Cadillac tax on high-value health insurance plans from Clinton.And since Sanders was running to raise the profile of his issues rather than to win, he didn‚Äôt bother to develop much in the way of answers to foreign policy questions, even though Clinton‚Äôs record of support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq and her hawkish instincts were some of her biggest vulnerabilities with the Democratic Party base.Elected officials were almost uniformly afraid to endorse him, even if their policy views were closer to his than to Clinton‚Äôs, and left-of-center think tanks ‚Äî including ones that are deliberately positioned to the left of mainstream Democrats ideologically ‚Äî shied away from working with Sanders on policy development, for fear that Clinton‚Äôs wrath would destroy them if they did.(Continue Reading)" False link
