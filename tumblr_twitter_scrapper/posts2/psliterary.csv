But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique  Grant for the job, no one in the journalism community is more astounded  than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?Monique is not exactly on  top of the world. Her husband, David, has left her, and her career has  stagnated. Regardless of why Evelyn has chosen her to write her  biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart  her career.Summoned to Evelyn‚Äôs Upper East Side apartment,  Monique listens as Evelyn unfurls her story: from making her way to Los  Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the late  80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way. As Evelyn‚Äôs life  unfolds through the decades‚Äîrevealing a ruthless ambition, an unexpected  friendship, and a great forbidden love‚ÄîMonique begins to feel a very a  real connection to the actress. But as Evelyn‚Äôs story catches up with  the present, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique‚Äôs  own in tragic and irreversible ways.Filled with emotional  insight and written with Reid‚Äôs signature talent, this is a fascinating  journey through the splendor of Old Hollywood into the harsh realities  of the present day as two women struggle with what it means‚Äîand what it  takes‚Äîto face the truth.

Some publishing companies have imprints devoted to multicultural books  (HarperCollins‚Äô Amistad, Simon & Schuster‚Äôs Salaam Reads, Kensington‚Äôs Dafina), and others make diversity their primary mission (Lee & Low).  Nearly every established publisher, from the Big Five to independent  presses, has launched some sort of initiative or committee or program  dedicated to diversity. But are these efforts enough? How do  agents‚Äîgenerally considered the gatekeepers to publishing  companies‚Äîapproach this highly subjective issue? Are they in a position  to increase diversity and equity in publishing? I asked Saba Sulaiman of  Talcott Notch Literary Services and Eric Smith of P.S. Literary. SANGEETA MEHTA: To start, what is your definition of diversity? Do you think that this word is losing its meaning, or is the conversation just getting started?SABA SULAIMAN: I think the conversation has already  started‚Äîin fact, author Alisha Rai did a fantastic panel at the RT  convention this year called Diversity 102 which addresses this issue  perfectly (here‚Äôs the thread).  Most industry professionals are aware of the need for more diverse  books‚ÄîI‚Äôm ready to talk about how best to combat the lack of diversity  in publishing, both in terms of the books we read and push out, and in  terms of employing more marginalized people in the industry.ERIC SMITH: For me, diversity is about a wide array of  people being represented. And the reason we frequently talk about  publishing having that diversity problem, is because‚Ä¶well, those people  aren‚Äôt represented. And it‚Äôs tiring. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre losing the  meaning, I think lots of us are just exhausted from having the same  conversations again and again.Read the full interview at JaneFriedman.com" True link

It‚Äôs been edited by a critique partner.  You‚Äôve assembled a pitch. Now what? The next step is securing  literary representation to pitch your project to prospective  publishers. At P.S. Literary we receive approximately 2,000 emails a  month from aspiring authors‚Äîso how does a writer get from the slush pile  (what agents call those unsolicited emails) to our client roster?Believe it or not, it‚Äôs a series of reasonable steps that separate the rejections from the requests:1. Follow A Simple TemplateA  three-paragraph structure (1: title, word count, genre, hook; 2: an  overview of the plot told in a sales-oriented way like back cover copy;  3: a short author bio focusing on platform) is all you need. But don‚Äôt  label or number those paragraphs. Instead, try to make it flow like a  cover letter for a job. Most importantly, remember the goal of a query  letter is to get an agent to request more material, not to tell us your  life story or the entire backstory of your project. Leave us wanting  more, not with glazed eyes from an over-sharing monologue. If it‚Äôs too  long I‚Äôve probably stopped reading 25% of the way through. Some agents  ask for the title, word count, and genre at the bottom of a query  letter, but in my opinion essential information should absolutely be at  the top in case the agent doesn‚Äôt make it to the end.Read the full article at OpenBook.ca " True link

What is your favorite word?  ¬†FINISHED! ¬†Every author loves the feeling of completing a project, and  hearing your editor say that SHE also considers the manuscript to be  finished is a sensation second to none.2. What is your least favorite word?  ¬†I take issue with the word CAN‚ÄôT. ¬†Girls can‚Äôt join our club, I can‚Äôt  possibly complete this project on time, You can‚Äôt get anyone to publish  your book, We can‚Äôt fix what‚Äôs wrong. ¬†Saying CAN‚ÄôT closes every door.

I love sleeping under the  stars, eating out of doors, walking in all kinds of weather. If I hit a  block in my writing, a stroll around the neighborhood never fails to  shake something loose.

I decided to go into publishing for the usual reasons: books were  incredibly important to me growing up, and a huge comfort at many times  in my life. It always felt a bit magical to find the right book at the  right time, and when I realized that real people were involved in making  that magic happen, the decision to go into publishing seemed natural. I  first tried my hand at publicity because I‚Äôve always preferred to work  with people and enjoy the selling aspect of the business, but it was  very much ‚Äúend of the process‚Äù which I quickly realized was not a good  fit for me.Agenting, which is the complete opposite end of the process, seemed  like a natural alternative. And it turns out I love working with  projects I choose and believe in, and I really enjoy using my  negotiating skills as an advocate for authors. I was lucky enough to  assist at an agency that works with some of the top names in SF/F  fiction, which was just fantastic training with some really amazing  talent. Then I was ready to build my own list and well, here I am! What mistakes are you seeing most often in SF/F queries, and how can writers avoid them? I really think that SF/F queries are the most difficult ones to  write. The key (in my humble opinion) to any great query is of course  focusing on the character. It all falls apart without a concrete main  character to pin my emotions on. One mistake I often see is a query  that‚Äôs all about the elaborate magic system or the themes, but nothing  about why the conflict is personal for that main character/why I want to  read an entire book about them.But equally important in an SF/F query is showing what makes the world: 1. Interesting, and 2. Unique.The biggest problems I see in this area all come from a lack of  specificity. Vague phrases like ‚Äútrouble looms‚Äù or ‚Äúenemies surround  them‚Äù or ‚Äúa dark past‚Äù or even ‚Äúmagical powers‚Äù can apply to almost any  book, which means your MS will sound boring [or] unoriginal and I won‚Äôt  feel the need to read it. The good, interesting bits are always in the  specifics.If you‚Äôre in doubt, try a three draft method. First, vaguely sketch  out the events you need to include in the query, keeping a decent  balance of character and world, ending at the initial conflict that  pushes the MC into the meat of the book. Then, go back and add as many  specific details as you can to replace any vague wording. (Why is there a  war? What are the powers? What trouble do they fear? Why do they care  about these people? Etc.) Lastly, go back and prune because you‚Äôve  probably just written a monster of a query! Your best critiques are  going to come from people who have NOT read your manuscript (but who do  read in your genre).Read the full interview at Queership.com" True link

Most people, when faced with a messy disaster of a home, usually do one  of two things:1. Wait until it gets to the point of being completely unbearable and then clean everything in a whirlwind marathon and then consider it done; or2. Decide it‚Äôs all too overwhelming and just give up entirely, only cleaning things that are needed for immediate use and ignoring everything else because where do you even begin when everything is so terrible?Unfortunately,  neither one of those approaches is particularly effective or  sustainable. With marathon cleaning, your home ends up completely clean  for a very short period of time, and then the mess accumulates until you  reach your breaking point again. With avoidance, you never make any  progress, and you continue to be frustrated and overwhelmed by your home  all the time. But there is a better way. Rather than knocking yourself  out doing it all at once or pretending the mess isn‚Äôt there at all,  investing just a little bit of time every day (or, realistically, most  days) will get you to a clean home that you can actually enjoy much  faster than you‚Äôd think.‚ÄúA 20/10 is 20 minutes of cleaning followed by a 10-minute break‚ÄùRead the full article at HouseBeautiful.com" True link

First off, how long have you been an agent? What made you want to dive into this wacky business in the first place?I‚Äôve been at it for two years as of‚Ä¶ wow, as of just a week ago or so.I‚Äôd  spent a solid few years working at a publishing house in Philadelphia  (hi Quirk Books!), and while I adored every single minute of it, I  wanted to really work on my own projects. When the opportunity to agent  surfaced, with an agency that was on board for me to take on any wild  idea and just let me run with it, I jumped at the chance.It‚Äôs definitely a wacky business, but so extremely fulfilling. I love the book community.2. What genres do you represent? How important is the genre,  or will you take on something different just because it gives you the  feelings?I‚Äôm a little all over the place? Young Adult  across all genres‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs where my heart is, absolutely. I‚Äôve sold more  YA than anything else. But I also really love quirky and hard hitting  non-fiction, voice-driven sci-fi and fantasy, and cookbooks.Genre  is pretty important. Some stuff I just don‚Äôt quite get, because I don‚Äôt  read enough of it. For example, I don‚Äôt work on Middle Grade books,  because I simply haven‚Äôt read enough of it to feel confident that I‚Äôd  know what‚Äôs good. Same with say, commercial horror novels.Read the full interview in all its gif glory at FizzyFangirling.com " True link
