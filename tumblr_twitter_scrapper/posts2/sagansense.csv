The newly discovered Peruvian Viridigigas ciseskii is a neotropical ghost moth found in the Andes Mountains and is the first of its kind to be officially categorized.  John Rawlins, curator of the Section of Invertebrate Zoology at Carnegie Museum of Natural History, and John Grehan, a research associate, helped describe the new species and published their findings in the Annals of the Carnegie.  This green giant is so distinct, its wider evolutionary position has not been determined and a new genus, Viridigigas, has been created as it is unlike anything entomologists have observed before. Two unique individuals, a male and female, have been described and are the only ones to be collected thus far. A monster among ghost moths, the Viridigigas ciseskii has a 12 cm wingspan and a combination of features that are not seen in any other ghost moths of the Amazon or the world. Perhaps most striking, the moth’s wings are olive green and overlaid with swirls of irregular dark circular spots, enclosed in a series of fine lines. Other tropical ghost moths have predominantly brown wings, and not one has been documented with any type of circular pattern. Beyond its coloring, this new species also has unusual characteristics not typically found in ghost moths. The male features a large oval scent gland at the base of his forewing and the moth’s hind legs have long scent scales. While other moths do have similar traits, they are uncommon and shared only with an obscure, small gray moth found in central Chile and a large moth whose habitat is on the islands of Fiji. While it seems hard to believe that a moth this big remained hidden from human eyes for so long, many ghost moths go unnoticed. The caterpillars burrow in the ground or inside stems, and the non-feeding moths do not often come to light. Because these moths are often ghost-like and hard to come across, it is not yet known if the new species is rare or simply elusive. " False text

New solar panels, investigations that study neutron stars and even fruit flies are on the cargo list. Let’s take a look at what other bits of science are making their way to the orbiting laboratory 250 miles above the Earth… New solar panels to test concept for more efficient power source  Solar panels generate power well, but they can be delicate and large when used to power a spacecraft or satellites. This technology demonstration is a solar panel concept that is lighter and stores more compactly for launch than the solar panels currently in use.  Roll-Out Solar Array (ROSA) has solar cells on a flexible blanket and a framework that rolls out like a tape measure and snap into place, and could be used to power future space vehicles.   Investigation to Study Composition of Neutron Stars Neutron stars, the glowing cinders left behind when massive stars explode as supernovas, contain exotic states of matter that are impossible to replicate in any lab. NICER studies the makeup of these stars, and could provide new insight into their nature and super weird behavior. Neutron stars emit X-ray radiation, enabling the NICER technology to observe and record information about its structure, dynamics and energetics.  Experiment to Study Effect of New Drug on Bone Loss When people and animals spend lots of space, they experience bone density loss. In-flight exercise can prevent it from getting worse, but there isn’t a therapy on Earth or in space that can restore bone that is already lost. The Systemic Therapy of NELL-1 for osteoporosis (Rodent Research-5) investigation tests a new drug that can both rebuild bone and block further bone loss, improving health for crew members. Research to Understand Cardiovascular Changes Exposure to reduced gravity environments can result in cardiovascular changes such as fluid shifts, changes in total blood volume, heartbeat and heart rhythm irregularities, and diminished aerobic capacity.  The Fruit Fly Lab-02 study will use the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) to better understand the underlying mechanisms responsible for the adverse effects of prolonged exposure to microgravity on the heart. Fruit flies are effective model organisms, and we don’t mean on the fashion runway. Want to see how 1,000 bottles of fruit flies were prepared to go to space? Check THIS out. Space Life-Support Investigation Currently, the life-support systems aboard the space station require special equipment to separate liquids and gases. This technology utilizes rotating and moving parts that, if broken or otherwise compromised, could cause contamination aboard the station.  The Capillary Structures investigation studies a new method of water recycling and carbon dioxide removal using structures designed in specific shapes to manage fluid and gas mixtures.  Earth-Observation Tools Orbiting approximately 250 miles above the Earth’s surface, the space station provides pretty amazing views of the Earth. The Multiple User System for Earth Sensing (MUSES) facility hosts Earth-viewing instruments such as high-resolution digital cameras, hyperspectral imagers, and provides precision pointing and other accommodations.  This investigation can produce data that could be used for maritime domain awareness, agricultural awareness, food security, disaster response, air quality, oil and gas exploration and fire detection.  Watch the launch live HERE!

Below are 10 things to know about this iconic mission as we celebrate two decades of unprecedented science and discovery. 1. A Date to Remember Pathfinder launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on Dec. 4, 1996, and landed at Mars’ Ares Vallis on July 4, 1997. The landing site, an ancient flood plain in Mars’ northern hemisphere, is among the rockiest parts of the planet. Scientists chose it because they believed it was a relatively safe surface to land on and contained a wide variety of rocks deposited during a catastrophic flood. 2. Precious Cargo  Pathfinder delivered to Mars a tiny, 23-pound (11.5 kilogram) rover named Sojourner, which carried scientific instruments to analyze the Martian atmosphere, climate and geology. To put its small size in perspective, the mechanisms at the end of the Curiosity Rover’s robotic arm are heavier than all of Sojourner. You can check out a 360 video of Pathfinder and Sojourner here. 3. Who Named the Rover?  The name Sojourner was chosen after a year-long, worldwide competition in which students up to 18 years old were invited to write about a historical heroine and how she would translate their accomplishments to the Martian environment. Twelve-year-old Valerie Ambroise of Bridgeport, Connecticut, submitted the winning essay on Sojourner Truth, a Civil War-era abolitionist who made it her mission to “travel up and down the land” advocating for the rights of all people to be free and participate fully in society. 4. Quite the Entrance  Pathfinder’s landing was innovative and unprecedented. It entered the thin Martian atmosphere assisted by parachute to slow its descent and with a giant system of airbags to cushion the impact. This mission marked the first time this airbag technique was used. Spirit and Opportunity later used the same method successfully. 5. Mobile Matters  The wireless modem between Pathfinder and Sojourner was a commercial, off-the-shelf product. The project team acquired several and stress-tested them until they found the best ones to send off to Mars. 6. It’s in the Details  Sojourner had bumpers—actual mechanical fenders—painted with black and white stripes. It also had two forward-facing black-and-white cameras, and one rear-facing camera (all one-third of a Megapixel). And Sojourner’s tiny wheels measured just 12.5 centimeters in diameter. 7. Viral-worthy Pathfinder was widely regarded as one of the first “internet sensations.” There was so much web traffic from around the world, the entire internet backbone of France crashed under the load. 8. We’re Getting Warmer  Among the many scientific discoveries from Pathfinder and Sojourner: Rounded pebbles and cobbles at the landing site suggested that Mars might have had running water during a warmer past when liquid water was stable on the planet. Early morning water ice clouds also were seen in the lower atmosphere. 9. Long Live the Mission  The lander and the rover both outlived their design lives—the lander by nearly three times, and the rover by 12 times. 10. Pathfinder’s Photo Album  Go back in time and see historical photographs of Pathfinder’s assembly process here. " False text

Controlling through fear and intimidation; coercing and terrorizing them; forcing them to witness violence or callousness; threatening to physically harm them, others they love, their animals or possessions; stalking them; threatening abandonment.   4. Isolating them from others, especially their friends and family; physically confining them; telling them how they should think, act, dress, what decisions they can make, who they can see and what they can do (limiting their freedom); controlling their financial affairs.   5.

In new research published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,  they found, for the first time, that the neurotransmitter dopamine is  involved in human bonding, bringing the brain’s reward system into our  understanding of how we form human attachments. The results, based on a  study with 19 mother-infant pairs, have important implications for  therapies addressing postpartum depression as well as disorders of the  dopamine system such as Parkinson’s disease, addiction, and social  dysfunction. “The  infant brain is very different from the mature adult brain—it is not  fully formed,” says Barrett, University Distinguished Professor of  Psychology and author of the forthcoming book How Emotions Are Made: The Secret Life of the Brain.  “Infants are completely dependent on their caregivers. Whether they get  enough to eat, the right kind of nutrients, whether they’re kept warm  or cool enough, whether they’re hugged enough and get enough social  attention, all these things are important to normal brain development.  Our study shows clearly that a biological process in one person’s brain,  the mother’s, is linked to behavior that gives the child the social  input that will help wire his or her brain normally. That means parents’  ability to keep their infants cared for leads to optimal brain  development, which over the years results in better adult health and  greater productivity.”  A novel technology  To  conduct the study, the researchers turned to a novel technology: a  machine capable of performing two types of brain scans  simultaneously—functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, and  positron emission tomography, or PET. fMRI  looks at the brain in slices, front to back, like a loaf of bread, and  tracks blood flow to its various parts. It is especially useful in  revealing which neurons are firing frequently as well as how different  brain regions connect in networks. PET uses a small amount of  radioactive chemical plus dye (called a tracer) injected into the  bloodstream along with a camera and a computer to produce  multidimensional images to show the distribution of a specific  neurotransmitter, such as dopamine or opiods. Barrett’s  team focused on the neurotransmitter dopamine, a chemical that acts in  various brain systems to spark the motivation necessary to work for a  reward.  They tied the mothers’ level of dopamine to her degree of  synchrony with her infant as well as to the strength of the connection  within a brain network called the medial amygdala network that, within  the social realm, supports social affiliation. “We  found that social affiliation is a potent stimulator of dopamine,” says  Barrett. “This link implies that  strong social relationships have the  potential to improve your outcome if you have a disease, such as  depression, where dopamine is compromised. We already know that people  deal with illness better when they have a strong social network. What  our study suggests is that caring for others, not just receiving caring,  may have the ability to increase your dopamine levels.”  Cautionary findings  Before  performing the scans, the researchers videotaped the mothers at home  interacting with their babies and applied measurements to the behaviors  of both to ascertain their degree of synchrony. They also videotaped the  infants playing on their own. Once  in the brain scanner, each mother viewed footage of her own baby at  solitary play as well as an unfamiliar baby at play while the  researchers measured dopamine levels, with PET, and tracked the strength  of the medial amygdala network, with fMRI. The  mothers who were more synchronous with their own infants showed both an  increased dopamine response when viewing their child at play and  stronger connectivity within the medial amygdala network. “Animal  studies have shown the role of dopamine in bonding but this was the  first scientific evidence that it is involved in human bonding,” says  Barrett. “That suggests that other animal research in this area could be  directly applied to humans as well.” The  findings, says Barrett, are “cautionary.” “They have the potential to  reveal how the social environment impacts the developing brain,” she  says. “People’s future health, mental and physical, is affected by the  kind of care they receive when they are babies. If we want to invest  wisely in the health of our country, we should concentrate on infants  and children, eradicating the adverse conditions that interfere with  brain development.” " False text

As such, it’s nearly impossible for us to fathom the implications of exponential change. Exponential technologies are a tsunami of change… and you can either surf on top of them or be crushed by them. Kodak was crushed. Check out this 5 minute video that illustrates the implication of ignoring disruptive technologies.  The New “Kodak Moment” In 1996, Kodak was at the top of its game, with a market cap of over $28 billion and 140,000 employees. Few people know that 20 years earlier, in 1976, Kodak had invented the digital camera. It had the patents and the first-mover advantage. But that first digital camera was a baby that only its inventor (Steven Sasson) could love and appreciate. That first camera took .01 megapixel photos, took 23 seconds to record the image to a tape drive, and only shot in black and white. When Sasson showed his discovery to his executives, they ignored the technology and its implications. Fast forward to 2012, when Kodak filed for bankruptcy – disrupted by the very technology that they invented and subsequently ignored. In that same year, another company in the digital imagery business, Instagram, was acquired by Facebook for $1 billion, but they had just 13 employees. We’ve seen many other examples of disruption beyond Kodak. Blockbuster, for example, was disrupted by Netflix, a company that dematerialized, demonetized and democratized the video industry. The same year Blockbuster went bankrupt (2010), Netflix hit $2.2 billion in valuation. Today, Netflix is valued at nearly $70 billion. Regardless of their size, companies that don’t embrace exponential technological change will be left in the dust. What industries will be disrupted next?

Therefore, here’s a preemptive TL;DR so you still experience how cool these solar panels are: I now own 4 portable solar panels and 2 power banksTotal investment of $320They store 93.6 Amp hours of energy, which is enough to charge my Galaxy S7 phone for an entire month without sunlight.You can take these things friggin anywhere, literally.Hiking, golfing, swimming at the beach, driving, eating at a restaurant, ANYWHERE.Charge phone at same rate as a wall outletIf I charge my phone once per day, it will take me more 400 years to pay this offI need to continue to integrate more devices and appliances to make this investment worth itI have too much energy and can’t use it quickly enoughBest approach at the moment is to share as much energy per day with as many people as possibleFuture outlook: connect laptop, lamps, and smaller appliances in apartmentDespite current financial flaws, it’s just insanely cool and convenientFree and infinite energy no matter where you goI am now extremely conscious about how much power I waste doing mindless things on my phone Alright, there’s your TL;DR. Now let’s get to this.  PART 1: THE TECHNICAL STUFF May 31, 2017, was the last time I plugged my phone into a wall outlet. That night, my first portable solar panel arrived, and my phone has been disconnected from the grid ever since. As of my writing this on July 1, I’ve grown my solar production and storage to four panels and two power banks, and I haven’t felt worried about charging my phone at all (anymore). I’m someone who always promotes and advocates for solar energy, but until recently, I never used solar for myself. There came a point when I needed to take my advocacy a step further. As they say, if you’re going to talk the talk, you have to walk the walk. My mission is to show people the power of solar, and what better way to do that than to get some portable panels and show them off? Such as in a restaurant after a day of golf… Or, quite literally, while golfing… My first purchase was one portable solar panel, for just about $50. I purchased it from a company called iNiCE, which, I’ve found, was probably the best company to buy these from for one simple reason: this version of the iNiCE solar panels has 10000 mAh (10 Amp hours) of internal energy storage, which is enough to recharge my Samsung Galaxy S7 a little more than three times (it would charge the iPhone 7 four to five times). This means that with the panel’s 2.4 Amp, 5 Volt output, it takes my phone about 1.2 hours to recharge from empty, which is the same as the wall plug in your house. For some technical clarity, storage capacity is defined in terms of how long it takes a battery to recharge at 1 Amp/hour. A 10 Amp hours battery (10000 mAh), takes 10 hours to recharge. The iNiCE solar panel functions optimally at 2.4 Amps under direct sunlight, so, optimally, it takes 4.1 hours to charge (but efficiency decreases as the panel heats up, so allow time in the shade or find a way to cool the panel if you want to maintain peak performance in one sitting). Trust me, these things get HOT. Looking at other products, most competitors don’t have energy storage attached to their panels. This makes iNiCE convenient and reliable, because I can sit my solar panels out in the sun for a few hours and charge their batteries to full capacity. But if you put a competitor’s panel in the sun all day, it won’t store energy without a separate power bank attached. That’s the other reason iNiCE panels are so convenient: you can charge them, then drain their batteries into a power bank. Granted, you’ll lose some energy in the transfer, but you won’t notice the loss without physically measuring it yourself. Along with my first solar panel, I purchased a 26800 mAh power bank (26.8 Amp hours) from Anker, for $60. This power bank can charge my phone just about nine times at full capacity.   In the image below, the power banks are the black boxes behind the panels (each bank is 7 in X 3 in). Alright, all the technical stuff is out of the way. Let’s get to the fun parts, shall we?  PART 2: SOLAR PANELS ARE FUN AND EXCITING The sheer awesomeness of owning solar panels definitely put me on a high for a few days. I was, and still am, very conscious of putting my panels in the sun when it’s out. There’s just something so beautiful about opening the panels under the sun and seeing your phone screen light up, indicating a charge has begun. I can be out in the middle of my yard, driving down the road, playing golf, even going for a hike, and these work absolutely everywhere. Solar gives you that freedom. I’d even go so far as to say that solar panels should be a priority for anyone who goes long-term hiking and camping. No need to worry about your phone going dead in an emergency, ever. The image below was taken as I was driving 9 hours to vacation. It’s just exciting. Every morning, when I need to, I wake up and put my solar panels in the sunlight to make use of every photon the day has to give. I eat breakfast, take a shower, go write my book in a coffee shop for a couple hours, come back, and the panel is fully charged. By then, it’s usually only 10 or 11 in the morning! Three full phone charges – more than enough for two days – all in the time it takes me to edit a few pages in my book and drink a few coffees. Weeks of phone charge, that is. You may be wondering about range anxiety, a common issue people bring up about electric cars (the general argument is that gas stations are everywhere, electric chargers are not. If you’re running low on charge, will you make it to an EV charger before you lose power?) I will admit, at first I was definitely using more power than I had available. Wasting time on the phone, bright screen, playing music and videos off the phone a lot, etc. My restriction on power made me self-conscious of how much power I, as an individual, use every single day. And I consider myself to be on the low end of power usage. I know people who watch YouTube for hours. Play mindless games. Text nonstop. Even more power consuming, using Snapchat for most of their communication. Imagine how many full phone charges a day some people require, maybe even yourself! I started limiting myself on my phone. I set time restrictions, restrictions on things I’d download, how long I’d use my phone for videos and music, how I would communicate with people. This conscious effort not only made me aware of how much energy I waste, but made me think, if I’m somewhere on the low to middle end of the spectrum, how much energy are we wasting when hundreds of millions of people are combined? What if we, the consumers, are responsible for higher costs of energy because it is so convenient to access, because we almost always near a wall outlet (except for the Starbucks I wrote my fourth book in. That place was a power outlet void). Let me point something out: Sunlight, if you didn’t notice, IS FREAKING EVERYWHERE. As a guy trying to use sunlight to generate electrical energy, to prove the concept that solar panels work and are exciting and should be adopted en masse, I’ve already caught myself wishing for cloudy days. No pun intended, but that’s where I think solar power really shines. The fact that I can literally step outside and immediately charge my phone is amazing in itself, but is, in the end, just a cheap trick I started taking for granted in the first week of owning solar panels. The true proof of concept requires you to sustain yourself day after day like that, even on the cloudy ones. Even in the rainstorms. Even in the blizzards. Even in the asteroid apocalypse. If the sun is always out, there’s nothing to prove. It gets boring. You stop noticing where your energy is coming from. The real excitement–the stuff that gets your blood pumping–comes when the sun isn’t shining. Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs? When that first power level light drops down a bar, does your heart start racing, and your mind start thinking, “I need to recharge, NOW.” Yes, the proof of concept for bringing solar energy to the world’s infrastructure is not in producing energy, but in storing energy. Fast fact: enough sunlight hits the earth every hour to power the world for an entire year. The trick is, do we have the ability to store that energy and use it later? And if we don’t have enough storage, can we use that energy quickly enough, and begin storing even more energy, in a way that is deemed a successful economic investment? Or is it being used simply to show off, to look flashy? Ooooh, shiny: the only thing missing is some good ol’ Star Trek lens flare. Above, I said there is simply too much energy for me to use. I’m not lying. As of writing this, I haven’t even touched my power banks in almost three weeks, because every day, I charge my panels when I’m writing, or at work, or literally driving around town. I am always collecting energy, but that doesn’t mean I’m using it. I know I can fill 100% of my storage capacity in less than two days of sunlight (15 hours of peak performance). But I use less than 4% of that energy per day, which means the rest of the energy is just…existing. Nobody is touching it. I would need to connect every phone in my house, every laptop, and every television, just to use most of the energy I can store each day. And the thing is, I can keep upgrading. I can keep adding storage. I know with my current 48 inches by 12 inches of surface area (all four panels combined), I can collect about 200 Amp hours every day. That’s 24 laptop charges, or 66 cell phone charges. I just need more storage to accomplish that. Finding more ways to use this energy will help me pay off my investment. At the moment, if I charge my phone once a day, it will take me a whopping 400 years to pay off this entire system. You can see the problem. As I said above, I need to use as much energy as possible, as quickly as possible, to make the return on this investment worth it, and chop down that time. Fortunately, I’m conscious about this sobering fact, and when I see family and friends charging from a power outlet or computer, I immediately connect them to my panels. I also leave the panels in the open, with the cords already attached, to encourage them to connect to the panel instead of plugging into the wall. Going even further than that, I’m going to start offering for other people to plug into my panels and power banks in public, rather than outlets. It’s free energy. It’s there for everyone to use. So here, have some, on me! Down the line, I plan to integrate my laptop, and build up to where I’m running lamps and appliances in my apartment on solar energy. Only then will the investments will pay off in years, even months, not centuries.  PART THREE: ENERGY USAGE AND AN ECONOMY OF SCALE The typical phone is recharged twice to three times a day. On average, over the course of a year, that adds up to about $2.40 USD added to your electric bill. Not much money, right? And that money is spread out. You don’t charge just at your house. You charge at work. At the airport. At your friend’s house. At a restaurant. You, the individual, might not be paying that $2.40, but it exists collectively, a few cents here, a few cents there. Someone, somewhere, is paying for a portion of the energy that goes into your phone. Imagine one million average people charging their phones each year. That’s $2,400,000 spent on energy. Now, let’s say they all drastically change their phone habits and charge just once a day. That price becomes a mere $800,000. By limiting their usage, one million people are saving $1,600,000. That’s an extra $1.60 in every person’s pocket, just by reducing the wasteful time we spend our phones. It might not seem like much on a small scale, but imagine that amplified across the world. The savings in just one year would be incredible. And that’s just from the energy on a phone. Imagine lights. Refrigerators. Air conditioning. Computers. Televisions. The savings from reducing wasteful usage on a large scale would add billions, perhaps trillions, into the world’s economy. Let me slow down a bit, because I’m getting ahead of myself. I’m sitting here saying that limiting our energy usage will save the world billions of dollars, but I’m supposed to be talking about solar panels. I made an investment. Sure, not using your phone will save you money, but you want to use your phone, obviously. So how does solar let you get your money’s worth? In the first week of June, I went to the beach and charged my panel every day, letting my family connect, too, so I could drain the power each day and maximize my energy investment. By the second week of June, I had four solar panels and two identical power banks. Altogether, 93.6 Amp hours of storage, enough to charge my laptop, from empty, 11 times. Altogether, this investment cost me $320. So again, you ask, “Is it worth the money?” My answer is complicated. You know what I’ve found? There is simply too much energy to collect, and I don’t have enough storage to collect it, nor do I have enough devices connected to the solar panels and power banks to make good use of all the energy I do have. As of my writing this, three solar panels and both power banks are 100% charged. The fourth panel is 50% charged, because I’ve had my phone hooked up to it all day during and after extensive use. I even had my panel charging in the middle of a restaurant to gain energy when I didn’t need it.  We take energy for granted. We see a wire that runs into our house, and we know that wire provides us with all the power we can ever hope for. But we never see the substation the energy comes from. We don’t see the coal or gas that gets burned. Energy is simply given to us, with the promise that it will always be there. What about blackouts, then? When a substation overloads, or a massive storm rampages up the coast, hundreds, thousands, even millions of people can lose power, because suddenly, the single line into their home is no longer receiving energy from the source. Solar energy, and all renewables, I should add, is different because of storage. When you put solar panels on your house, you can also add a box that collects the energy to save surplus energy for later use, and it can be located inside the house, not out in the weather. What happens when a storm takes out the neighborhood? You won’t lose power.  What happens when a tree smashes through a power line? You won’t lose power. What happens when lightning strikes the substation, or a transformer explodes? You won’t lose power. What happens when ice snaps electric wires? You won’t lose power. There are still pitfalls—such as cloudy days, or not enough storage capacity—but solar energy, in the long term, is meant to be shared. Energy collected on one side of the world can be transferred elsewhere as needed. Live in Portland, Oregon, or the UK? You could be getting your energy from a location that receives copious amounts of sunlight, too much for that area to use. In fact, there are already entire islands running on solar energy, such as the American Somoa, Haiti, the island of Kauai in Hawai’i, and other small islands. And soon, following massive rolling blackouts, southern Australia will be powered by solar, thanks to an initiative by Tesla and Elon Musk that has led to a worldwide solar energy arms race. It is this kind of competition – healthy competition that forges an energy revolution – that is steadily rising as renewable energy takes center stage away from limited fossil fuels. So there it is, the experience of my first month with portable solar panels. It’s been fun, and I’m looking forward to building up my solar array even more! I will continue to update as I experiment and grow, and hopefully one day my life will be running on free, clean, and infinite solar energy, and all the other renewable sources nature has to provide. In just one month, these four small panels have begun to transform my life and energy awareness. What else are they capable of? Do you want your own portable solar panels? I purchased mine HERE  Like the power banks I have? I got those HERE  " False text

Don’t be afraid to ditch your textbooks when necessary to learn something your own way! Here are some of my favorite educational YoutTube channels! TED-Ed You’ve heard of TEDx Talks, now get ready for TED-Ed! These videos range from philosophy and history to science and riddles! They even have a few videos on writing! Most all videos are done in five minute animations with narration and also include links to full lessons in the descriptions of the videos. Watching this channel for hours on end will only scratch the surface of what is offered! CrashCourse This one you’ve probably already heard of, but it’s worth checking out! Since CrashCourse has been online for years now, they now have several very interesting videos to watch, ranging from psychology to sociology and physics to film history. They also have videos centered around literature and astronomy and so much more. My personal favorite has been the mythology videos! The videos are made weekly in a series format, so you could watch one lesson a week or binge watch the whole class once it’s done. Overly Sarcastic Productions If you’re not so into the lecturing-style the above channels have, then a great place to check out is Overly Sarcastic Productions. These videos are actually made by two college students hoping to teach their favorite subjects in a humorous way! They have videos ranging from literature to history to mythology, as well as some videos on religion and philosophy. And most all of these videos are done in adorable animation and are quite easy to follow, and they stand the test of watching multiple times! NerdyAndQuirky If you’re looking for something even more casual and without any sort of curriculum, if you’re just looking to watch some educational videos just for the fun of it—I highly suggest NerdyAndQuirky! This channel is chock full of “Cool History,” ranging from art to debunking myths as well as video essays and some social commentary. Also, get ready for the puns!  Might I add: Philosophy Tube A fantastic resource for balanced, clear, and accessible philosophy videos. The host, Olly Lennard, makes philosophy fun and interesting, as it should be. The topics range from ethics to politics & law to aesthetics. Plus, he’s charming and easy on the eyes, which always makes learning a bit easier.  Contrapoints This channel is challenging and enlightening. The host (name unknown) bridges incredibly complex and controversial topics with a combination of nuance and humor that is as refreshing as it is rare. Not for the faint of heart or the lazy of mind, Contrapoints may offend some but will never fail to offer a sophisticated take on an issue. The topics typically revolve around social issues, with lots of time spent exploring the tension between left and right political ideologies. I HIGHLY recommend the two-part series exploring free speech. It’s one of the best analyses of the issue I’ve come across.  Vox Bite-size journalistic editorials that explore up-to-date news stories and a wide range of novel topics, from Why cartoon characters wear gloves to the rise of ISIS, explained in 6 minutes. Their stated mission is to help you ‘cut through the noise and understand what’s driving events in the headlines and in our lives, on everything from Taxes to Terrorism to Taylor Swift’ The School of Life This channel, created by author and public philosopher Alain de Botton, aims to explore ‘the questions we’re never taught enough about at regular school or college: How can relationships go well? What is meaningful work? How can love last? How can one find calm? What’s gone wrong (and right) with capitalism?’ It offers short introductions to various thinkers and schools of thought, including Stoicism, Epicureanism, Sartre, and Camus. Will Schoder While Schoder hasn’t released a whole lot of videos as of yet, each one he’s done is damn near a masterpiece. One of the most talented video essayists I’ve come across on YouTube, his videos dive into the philosophy and psychology of pop culture, including the existentialism of Rick and Morty, the cognitive underpinnings of persuasion via Mr. Rogers, and the dangers of postmodern irony through the lens of David Foster Wallace and sitcoms.  Nerdwriter1 Another one of my favorite video essayists, Nerdwriter tackles a variety of topics with adept editing talents, impressive production value, and surprising insights. The stated mission of this channel is to ‘put ideas to work,’ which is skillfully and entertainingly accomplished here on a regular basis. If those don’t satiate your hunger for knowledge, some of my other most beloved channels include: Physics Girl, PBS Idea Channel, Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell, WirelessPhilosophy, SciShow, feministfrequency, minutephysics, Mental Floss, AsapSCIENCE, Wisecrack, and It’s Okay To Be Smart Now go drink in the wonders, my friends!

A total solar eclipse occurs when the new moon is in just the right position to completely cover the sun’s disk. This will happen next month on August 21, when the new month completely blocks our view of the sun along a narrow path from Oregon to South Carolina. It may even be dark enough during the eclipse to see some of the brighter stars and few planets! Two weeks before or after a solar eclipse, there is often, but not always, a lunar eclipse. This happens because the full moon, the Earth and the sun will be lined up with Earth in the middle. Beginning July 1, we can see all the moon’s phases. Many of the Apollo landing sites are on the lit side of the first quarter moon. But to see these sites, you’ll have to rely on images for lunar orbiting spacecraft. On July 9, the full moon rises at sunset and July 16 is the last quarter. The new moon begins on July 23 and is the phase we’ll look forward to in August, when it will give us the total solar eclipse. The month of July ends with a first quarter moon. We’ll also have two meteor showers, both of which peak on July 30. The Delta Aquarids will have 25 meteors per hour between midnight and dawn. The nearby slow and bright Alpha Capricornids per at 5 per hour and often produce fireballs.

Here are some things to know about our fascinating space rubble. 1. A Place in Space  Asteroids—named by British astronomer William Herschel from the Greek expression meaning “star-like""—are rocky, airless worlds that are too small to be called planets. But what they might lack in size they certainly make up for in number: An estimated 1.1 to 1.9 million asteroids larger than 1 kilometer are in the Main Belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. And there are millions more that are smaller in size. Asteroids range in size from Vesta—the largest at about 329 miles (529 kilometers) wide—to bodies that are just a few feet across. 2. What Lies Beneath  Asteroids are generally categorized into three types: carbon-rich, silicate, or metallic, or some combination of the three. Why the different types? It all comes down to how far from the sun they formed. Some experienced high temperatures and partly melted, with iron sinking to the center and volcanic lava forced to the surface. The asteroid Vesta is one example we know of today. 3. Small Overall  If all of the asteroids were combined into a ball, they would still be much smaller than the Earth’s moon. 4. Except for a Big One  In 1801, Giuseppe Piazzi discovered the first and then-largest asteroid, Ceres, orbiting between Mars and Jupiter. Ceres is so large that it encompasses about one-fourth of the estimated total mass of all the asteroids in the asteroid belt. In 2006, its classification changed from asteroid to  as a dwarf planet. 5. Mission to a Metal World  NASA’s Psyche mission will launch in 2022 to explore an all-metal asteroid—what could be the core of an early planet—for the very first time. And in October 2021, the Lucy mission will be the first to visit Jupiter’s swarms of Trojan asteroids. 6. Near-Earth Asteroids The term ‘near’ in near-Earth asteroid is actually a misnomer; most of these bodies do not come close to Earth at all. By definition, a near-Earth asteroid is an asteroid that comes within 28 million miles (44 million km) of Earth’s orbit. As of June 19, 2017, there are 16,209 known near-Earth asteroids, with 1,803 classified as potentially hazardous asteroids (those that could someday pose a threat to Earth). 7. Comin’ in Hot  About once a year, a car-sized asteroid hits Earth’s atmosphere, creates an impressive fireball, and burns up before reaching the surface. 8. But We’re Keeping an Eye Out Ground-based observatories and facilities such as Pan-STARRS, the Catalina Sky Survey, and ATLAS are constantly on the hunt to detect near-Earth asteroids. NASA also has a small infrared observatory in orbit about the Earth: NEOWISE. In addition to detecting asteroids and comets, NEOWISE also characterizes these small bodies. 9. Buddy System Roughly one-sixth of the asteroid population have a small companion moon (some even have two moons). The first discovery of an asteroid-moon system was of asteroid Ida and its moon Dactyl in 1993. 10. Earthly Visitors  Several NASA space missions have flown to and observed asteroids. The NEAR Shoemaker mission landed on asteroid Eros in 2001 and NASA’s Dawn mission was the first mission to orbit an asteroid in 2011. In 2005, the Japanese spacecraft Hayabusa landed on asteroid Itokawa. Currently, NASA’s OSIRIS-REx is en route to a near-Earth asteroid called Bennu; it will bring a small sample back to Earth for study.

This debris poses a threat to satellites, space vehicles and astronauts aboard those vehicles. What makes tidying up especially challenging is that the debris exists in space. Suction cups don’t work in a vacuum. Traditional sticky substances, like tape, are largely useless because the chemicals they rely on can’t withstand the extreme temperature swings. Magnets only work on objects that are magnetic. Most proposed solutions, including debris harpoons, either require or cause forceful interaction with the debris, which could push those objects in unintended, unpredictable directions.

People who are focused on criticizing their partners miss a whopping 50 percent of positive things their partners are doing and they see negativity when it’s not there. People who give their partner the cold shoulder—deliberately ignoring the partner or responding minimally—damage the relationship by making their partner feel worthless and invisible, as if they’re not there, not valued. And people who treat their partners with contempt and criticize them not only kill the love in the relationship, but they also kill their partner’s ability to fight off viruses and cancers. Being mean is the death knell of relationships. Kindness, on the other hand, glues couples together. Research independent from theirs has shown that kindness (along with emotional stability) is the most important predictor of satisfaction and stability in a marriage. Kindness makes each partner feel cared for, understood, and validated—feel loved. “My bounty is as boundless as the sea,” says Shakespeare’s Juliet. “My love as deep; the more I give to thee, / The more I have, for both are infinite.” That’s how kindness works too: there’s a great deal of evidence showing the more someone receives or witnesses kindness, the more they will be kind themselves, which leads to upward spirals of love and generosity in a relationship. There are two ways to think about kindness. You can think about it as a fixed trait: either you have it or you don’t. Or you could think of kindness as a muscle. In some people, that muscle is naturally stronger than in others, but it can grow stronger in everyone with exercise […] “Kindness doesn’t mean that we don’t express our anger,” Julie Gottman explained, “but the kindness informs how we choose to express the anger. You can throw spears at your partner. Or you can explain why you’re hurt and angry, and that’s the kinder path.” " False link

That is approximately the number of poor children there are in the world – which stands at 689m across 103 countries, according to a new report published by my colleagues at the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI).  Even more frustrating is that children, who represent 34% of the population in these countries, constitute half of the world’s poor and have a higher rate of poverty than adults. This is a call for action that poses a huge challenge to the accomplishment of goal number one of the UN’s sustainable development goals (SDGs): ending poverty in all its forms and dimensions.  As the UN High Level Political Forum meets on July 10 to discuss poverty eradication and track progress on the SDGs, the international community at large must take swift action to address this issue.  The OPHI report used the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index, first introduced in 2010, which comprises a series of measures that assess deprivations in health, education and living standards to find out how many children are what are called “multidimensionally poor”. When looking at populations across 103 low and middle-income countries for which data is available, the research team found that children represent 48% of the multidimensional poor – and account for two out of every five children in these countries. Some 87% of the 689m are growing up in South Asia and in Sub-Saharan Africa – around 300m in each region. In Ethiopia, Niger and South Sudan more than 90% of all children are multidimensionally poor. The report also found that younger children, from birth to the age of nine, are the poorest according to the index – meaning more action is needed to improve nutrition and education in early stages of life.

I’m going to share what I’ve learned. Scientists who study ticks saw this year coming. Two years ago, I was walking through the forest with biologist Richard Ostfeld as he hunted for ticks (“Oh, I have an adult! Fantastic!”) when he warned me that 2017 was going to be really bad. That’s because 2015 was a “mast year,” when trees produce a ton of acorns. (Plant biologists are still figuring out how and why trees decide to mast.) The year after a mast year, the acorn-gnawing mouse population booms, and then the year after that—i.e., right now—the mouse blood–sucking tick population goes bonkers. Mice are also among the most important hosts for Lyme disease, the most common tick-borne disease in the country, so 2017 is likely to be a doozy for Lyme. (There are other dangerous and weird tick-borne diseases, many of which are becoming more prevalent. For more on the glorious spectrum, read this article I wrote for Slate a couple years ago.) But back to the point. What should you do to avoid getting sick from a tick? 1. Do daily tick checks. I cannot stress this enough: The best way to avoid a tick-borne disease is to check every inch of every family member’s body every day from April through November. Make it part of your evening routine so that you don’t forget. Lyme usually takes at least 24 hours to transmit after a tick embeds—the range I’ve seen for most other tick-borne diseases is 12 to 36 hours, although there are scary exceptions. So if you remove it on the same day, you’ll probably be fine. Keep in mind, too, that tiny tick nymphs, which feed during the spring and early summer, are about the size of poppy seeds. Look for brown or black dots with legs. And look everywhere: ears, the backs of knees and elbows, armpits, hairlines, groins. (I know a handful of parents who’ve removed ticks from their sons’ penises.) If you do find one, don’t do crazy things to it. Follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s simple removal protocol. I recommend then saving the tick in a sealed plastic bag so that you can later identify and potentially test it. It’ll dry out and die in there, too. I rather enjoy watching ticks perish. 2. Treat your clothes. Permethrin is a synthetic pesticide derived from chrysanthemums that you can apply to shoes and clothes. When permethrin is dry, it’s perfectly safe; the concentration applied is very low (typically 0.5 percent permethrin; by comparison, Deep Woods Off is 25 percent DEET). Thomas Mather, the University of Rhode Island scientist who runs the most useful tick website around, explained to me that a child would have to wear 1,100 pairs of socks and shorts and T-shirts and hats, all at once, to get a dose of permethrin that reaches the Environmental Protection Agency’s level of concern. Adults would have to wear a lot more. I rather enjoy watching ticks perish. And permethrin works—way better than regular insect repellents. " False link

This is the first time the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has said it aims to send an astronaut beyond the International Space Station, an agency spokeswoman told AFP on Friday. The idea is to first join a NASA-led mission in 2025 to build a space station in the moon’s orbit, as part of a longer-term effort by NASA to reach Mars. Tokyo hopes that contributing to the multinational mission and sharing Japanese technology will land it a coveted spot at the station, from which it could eventually send an astronaut to the Moon, the spokeswoman said.

The Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Prohibition of Onshore Hydraulic Fracturing) Bill 2016 now awaits Irish President Michael D. Higgins’ signature. The president is expected to sign it into law “in the coming days.”  The Emerald Isle will join three other European Union member states, France, Germany and Bulgaria that have banned the practice on land. Fine Gael TD Tony McLoughlin introduced the private member’s bill—meaning it was not introduced by the government—last year. The bill passed Ireland’s Parliament in May. ‘We’ve made history,“ McLoughlin tweeted after the vote and called it one of the “proudest moments in my political career.”  Continue Reading.

The first, said Juno’s principal investigator said Juno’s principal investigator from Juno’s initial two flybys back in August 2016 describe giant cyclones, a super powerful magnetic field, and weird northern lights that behave totally different to our own. The discoveries were made when the basketball court-sized spacecraft swooped within 5,000 kilometres (3,106 miles) of the cloud tops, and drifted over the planet’s poles. “What we’ve learned so far is Earth-shattering. Or should I say, Jupiter-shattering,” said Juno’s principal investigator at the South Research Institute, Scott Bolton. “Discoveries about its composition, magnetosphere, and poles are as stunning as the photographs the mission is generating.”  Continue Reading.

I would encourage them to look past their opinions and social conditioning and key into what we’re doing here — which is telling a story about humanity that will hopefully bring us all together.. And it’s hard to understand and appreciate Star Trek if you don’t understand and appreciate that,” Martin-Green continued. “It’s one of the foundational principles of Star Trek and I feel if you miss that then you miss the legacy itself. I’m incredibly proud to be the lead of this show and be at the forefront of an iteration of Star Trek that’s from the eyes of a black woman that’s never been done before, though obviously there’s been other forms of diversity that have been innovated by Trek. I feel like we’re taking another step forward, which I think all stories should do. We should go boldly where nobody has gone before and stay true to that. " False link
