Cornell’s family said that without toxicology test results completed they don’t know what caused his death.  Cornell was a leader of the grunge movement with Seattle-based Soundgarden, with whom he gained critical and commercial acclaim. He also found success outside the band with his solo music and the band Temple of the Dog.  " True text

Plus, the guys talk about why they decided to work with producers Mattman & Robin on the new album (including the lead single – and top 20 Billboard Hot 100 hit – “Believer”) along with songwriter Justin Tranter. (That trio also collaborated on hits like DNCE’s “Cake by the Ocean” and Selena Gomez’s “Hands to Myself.”)“We knew for the first time we wanted to bring in producers [on the new album],” Reynolds tells Billboard. “As a band, we’ve always self-produced about 80 percent of [our albums] and then done a couple tracks per record with Alex Da Kid, who’s also our label [KIDinaKORNER] president – and he’s great. But we wanted to bring in fresh eyes to come in and say, ‘Hey, these are the things that maybe you can let go of with the band and these are things maybe let’s look at more.’“I felt like we still were trying to find our identity,” Reynolds continues, “and we needed someone to come in and kind of help us find our own identity – as crazy as that sounds.“We met with a lot of different producers, and Mattman & Robin were two that we really… we just really clicked with them. We knew that we wanted to be more minimalistic on this record, and they do that. That’s their bread and butter.“As for how the group linked up with former Semi Precious Weapons frontman Tranter? Turns out, he’s been pals of Reynolds’ for a while. “Justin is an old friend,” Reynolds says. “My wife [Aja Volkman] sings for a band called Nico Vega, and they used to tour with Semi Precious Weapons a lot. So I knew Justin from his days in the band, and he’s just such a rad individual and incredible writer.”In addition to writing tracks like “Cake by the Ocean” and “Hands to Myself,” Tranter has also co-written such songs as Justin Bieber’s No. 1 Hot 100 hit “Sorry,” Fall Out Boy’s “Centuries,” Maroon 5’s “Cold” and Linkin Park’s “Heavy.”  Reynolds says Tranter was “very respectful” when they got together to write. “[When] we got in the room, I said, ‘Look, this is the first time that I’ve written with someone else, and I feel I have to write my own lyrics, or I feel weird about it, and I just wanted to get that out of the way.’ And Justin was like, ‘Look, I am here to help you be the best version of you.’ And that was really important to me, and Justin was just such an incredible sounding board and brought so much to the table. They were just such a rad team to work with.”  " True text

With each appearance this time, however, Reynolds and his band mates will be delivering a message of social consciousness. Now the father of three, including five-week old twins, Reynolds wants to deliver a message of equality and love his kids can be proud of down the line.I spoke with Reynolds and guitarist Daniel Wayne Sermon about the new album, the greatest political songwriters and Kendrick Lamar.Steve Baltin: Will tonight be the first time you play new material live?Dan Reynolds: Two of the songs this will be the first time playing them tonight cause there are three new songs we’ve released. We’ve released “Believer,” then “Thunder” and “Whatever It Takes.” And so “Thunder” and “Whatever It Takes” we’ve never played live, gonna be a doozy.Baltin: There is always that exhilaration that comes from playing a song live because the audience takes it over.Reynolds: Totally, you feel the energy of the room.Daniel Wayne Sermon: We rehearsed it for the first time yesterday and so we’re so smart the first time we play a new song it’s gonna be broadcast on You Tube and it’s like, “What are we thinking?”Reynolds: But yeah, that is when a song comes to life, totally, when you have an audience.Baltin: How did the songs change in rehearsal?Reynolds: When we’re playing the song live we typically play it differently from how it’s on the record. In fact Wayne sat down with a couple of the songs and added parts and outros and intros and solos, just things that lend better to the live purposes cause when you’re putting something on a record you’re trimming the fat. But when we reproduce it live that fat lives, that’s where it thrives.Sermon: It’s like a delicious steak with all this fat on it, that’s the best part of the steak.Baltin: When you performed at the Grammys with Kendrick.in 2014 could you feel he was ready to go to the next level?  Sermon: Yeah, it felt like he’s the natural continuation of Tupac and Biggie, he’s that level.Reynolds: Yeah, he resurrects that ‘90s hip hop that I love and grew up on. When we got in the room with Kendrick, also just as a human being he’s a wonderful humble person that’s just there for the music.Sermon: That is true, it’s the music for him, he’s very old school.Baltin: How does it inspire you musically to be around people like that?Sermon: When you do an arena show it’s like the traveling circus. You see the same people every day, it’s generally the same show and if you’re not careful it can be a little monotonous, but these festivals we do and when we get to meet other bands, like you said, like-minded people, we’re not alone in this, there are other people that are trying to achieve the same goals we are. So each festival is different, but it can be a pretty good hang sometimes with the other artists.Baltin: Talk about your evolution as a political songwriter.Reynolds: I grew up on the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and those were two very politically driven bands, even U2. Bono and the role that he’s played, the voice that he’s had, I think inspired me growing up. And I think that is what remained with me the most even when it comes to those bands. The music I love, but the reason those are some of my favorite bands is I felt like behind the music there was a human being who had thoughts in his head and emotions and feelings about politics and feelings about culture and I think that solidified these bands as more than just music to me.Baltin: Who are some of the artists that stand out for you as messengers of social change?Reynolds: [David] Bowie represents, to me, a person who just symbolized accepting your identity and accepting everyone’s else identity for whoever they are and whatever they choose to identify as.Baltin: Does your success make it more important you speak out for the disenfranchised since music is so often a way for people to feel they are not alone?Reynolds: I think it’s more important than ever. I’m working with GLAAD and with the Trevor Project and they were telling me how it’s so important that people who come from conservative backgrounds, who come from the far right, step forward and become allies. As far as it goes for artists and musicians and actors and people in the spotlight, from all spectrums, the far right, the far left, when it comes to shedding a light on these things I think that it’s so important. The gravity and the weight I feel it every day, especially as I have, like I said, five-week old twins, when I pass on, whether or not they know I believed in God or anything like that, that, to me, I’m not concerned as much about. What I care is they know that dad believed in equality and that their dad believed in human rights, that is the lesson I want to leave with them.Baltin: Who would be your dream Billboard Awards collaborator?Reynolds: My dream collaboration would be Harry Nilsson since he’s my favorite artist and he’s passed on, but he’s influenced me more than probably any other artist. Current artist I’d always love to collaborate with Kendrick again. He’s one of my favorite artists currently and one of the most relevant artists alive right now." True text

According to the 29-year-old singer/songwriter, living in a house full of ladies has inspired new music on the band’s third studio album, Evolve, out June 23.“I will say that there are a couple songs on this record that are love songs and typically, I do not write love songs,” he told ET on Tuesday, just before hitting the stage for a performance at YouTube Space LA. “I think having all these girls in the house with me has softened my heart a little bit and led me to higher grounds.”When he’s not on the road, Reynolds says he couldn’t be happier to be surrounded by girls.“I am [outnumbered], yes, and I’m grateful for it,” he gushes. “I wanted girls, to be honest with you. So I’m happy.”Reynolds says that big sister Arrow – who frequents his adorable Instagram feed – is adjusting well to life with two little sisters.“She’s an amazing big sister, but I know that it’s been a little hard for her,” he admits. “Just because she was everything – and she still is, I want her to know that. I’ve found ways to kinda – like, two days ago we did a little hotel stay and had chocolate cake in bed and watched Aladdin. I definitely want her to know she’s still my number one.”With Evolve, Imagine Dragons are ready to do just that, taking on a new approach with both the lyrics and sound.“Lyrically, for me, this record was written from a really healthy spot,” Reynolds says. “We came home from tour, we’d been home for like a year, and so I think hopefully that shows in the record. Also, sonically, we took a more minimalistic approach to it, but it’s also a very colorful record, visually, so we thought Evolve was the appropriate title.”So far, fans have heard three offerings from the album – “Believer,” “Thunder” and “Whatever It Takes.”“I don’t think any one of those songs is an accurate representation of the album,” says drummer Daniel Platzman, “but I think between the three songs that are now available, in there lies Evolve.”One thing that won’t be on the album: collaborations with other artists.“I know we live in kinda the world of collaborations right now, but, you know, we really are focused on the band still, and we feel like we’re still kind of beginning to find out who we are as a band. We still feel young in a lot of ways,” Reynolds admits. “So we talked about it and then we decided, nah, we just wanted to do it all by ourselves.”After Evolve hits shelves, the guys will gear up for a fall tour to celebrate.“There are definitely a couple of elements to our live show that we’ve never done before,” says guitarist Wayne Sermon. “I think the best concerts are the ones where you feel sort of close to the person. Even if you’re up in the nosebleeds, you have that connection and you feel close to the performance, close to the artist, so we’re gonna try to capture that a little bit more on this album and make people feel like it’s just one big happy family.”" True text

The semi-annual fundraiser recognizes The Trevor Project’s impact in suicide prevention and crisis intervention for LGBTQ youth and raises awareness about their lifesaving resources.“With President Trump signing the religious liberty executive order last week, and anti-LGBTQ legislation being considered at the state level across the country, we need to reassure LGBTQ youth that they are not alone,” said Steve Mendelsohn, The Trevor Project Interim Executive Director. “There’s an army of allies standing with you, and they include Imagine Dragons band members and Shoshana Bean. We are grateful for advocates like them who are using their platform to counter and spread love.”Reynolds will be presented with the night’s top honor, the Trevor Hero award, for his advocacy and longtime support of The Trevor Project’s mission.“To me, equality means equal rights for all and showing love and support for every human being regardless of race, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, politics, or any other intersecting identities,” Reynolds said. “It’s important to me that I raise my three girls to see no difference in anyone and to only love. Both personally and professionally, I live my life in a way that will hopefully show my daughters that their dad will fight tirelessly until we all truly have equal rights. The Trevor Project award means far more to me than any accolade or accomplishment in my music or life. I want LGBTQ youth to know that they are whole and beautiful. I stand by their side and will do all in my power to be an ally, advocate and friend. Love is love.”Formed in 2009 and featuring lead vocalist Dan Reynolds, guitarist Wayne Sermon, bassist Ben McKee, and drummer Daniel Platzman, Imagine Dragons earned a grassroots following by independently releasing a series of EPs.The band made its major-label debut with the release of “Continued Silence,” a 2012 EP featuring the two-time platinum breakthrough single “It’s Time.” “Night Visions” arrived later that year and Imagine Dragons found themselves on a skyward trajectory that saw the album debut at No. 2 on the Billboard Top 200 Albums chart and became the No. 1 album on Spotify Worldwide for 2013. The album’s second single, the nine-time platinum “Radioactive,” hit No. 1 on the Billboard Rock chart and earned the band a 2014 Grammy for Best Rock Performance. Imagine Dragons’ platinum-selling second album, “Smoke + Mirrors,” debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Top 200 album chart and has sold 1.1 million copies worldwide. The band’s third album, “Evolve,” is due June 23.(…)Fans and advocates will be able to join the gala via Facebook where The Trevor Project will livestream the red carpet arrivals and show.

Since then, the Las Vegas-based rockers had reached the chart five times, with three top 10s to its credit, including the No. 2-peaking “Demons” (Aug. 20, 2013) and the No. 3 “I Bet My Life” (Feb. 7, 2015).Meanwhile, having needed only seven weeks to reach No. 1 after its debut at No. 30 (Feb. 18), “Believer” marks the quickest rise to No. 1 on the tally in nearly two years, since Muse’s “Dead Inside,” which also sprinted to the top in its seventh week (May 23, 2015).“Believer” tops Alternative Songs a week after its coronation on Hot Rock Songs, where it also became the band’s first leader in four years, following, again, “Radioactive” (23 weeks at No. 1). The track holds atop Hot Rock Songs, as well as Rock Digital Song Sales and Alternative Digital Song Sales (39,000 sold in the week, according to Nielsen Music).

It’s s an inflammatory disease that affects the spine and large joints within the body and during a sold-out show at the Leeds Arena in West Yorkshire, England Reynolds finally shared that diagnosis with fans.“I had had enough,” he said during a recent phone interview. “I was in a lot of pain and experiencing a really bad flare up and I wanted to cancel the show, but I didn’t. I just made the decision to share because I was tired of holding on to this.”Reynolds said his hips were aching and he was experiencing shooting pains but he addressed it with the crowd and let them know that he wasn’t going to let ankylosing spondylitis dictate how he lived his life any further.“The fans were incredibly supportive from day one,” he said. “From there, I made the connection with the ankylosing spondylitis society and we put together this plan to raise awareness about this hidden disease.”Reynolds has joined the This AS Life campaign, which is a partnership between global healthcare company Novartis and the Spondylitis Association of America, and is now connecting with others with AS via a series of webisodes of “This AS Life Live!” at ThisASLife.com. During the episodes he interviews people living with AS about their specific diets, exercise and pain management regimens.“The thing about ankylosing spondylitis is that it’s such a unique disease that everyone’s treatment is fairly different and there’s no one-size-fits all treatment,” Reynolds explained. He has found relief in cleaning up his diet, practicing yoga, lifting weights to build up his core and a specific series of medications prescribed by his rheumatologist.“While I was figuring all of that out it was frustrating but in the long run it has been great,” he continued. “I just live a moderate life now. I still have my donuts and my other vices but instead of eating Lucky Charms cereal every day, I might save that just for the weekend.”For the first episode of “This AS Life Live!” Reynolds met up with professional chef Helgi Olafson and for future episodes he will interview a doctor, who after her AS diagnosis, decided to become a rheumatologist, and a professional gamer who discusses the therapy he undergoes to be able to sit for extended periods of time for his work.“It’s very uplifting for me to do this,” he said. “These people have found a place of peace and comfort with the disease and they’re still able to do the things they love. It makes me think like, ‘OK, I can get through this, look at what these people are going through’.”Years before his official diagnosis, Reynolds said he was experiencing unexplained pains in his ankles, knees and hips and that he had been misdiagnosed by at least four doctors who said he had symptoms of sciatica or a chiropractor that told him he might have a disc slightly out of place. After multiple MRIs he finally saw a rheumatologist to confirm the Ankylosing Spondylitis diagnosis.“I was stubborn,” he said. “I didn’t want to believe I had a disease. I was embarrassed because the word disease isn’t something anyone wants to have associated with themselves. I kept it to myself for years and during ‘Smoke + Mirrors,’ it got really dark in a lot of ways because I was in a dark place. I was dealing with depression and the disease because I didn’t have it under control, so speaking out about it helped me realize that I didn’t have to let it rule my life or to be ashamed about it. I needed to be an advocate and use this platform that I’ve been given to raise awareness so that people aren’t getting misdiagnosed time and time again.”Reynolds said he’s currently keeping plenty active. He still lives full-time in his hometown of Las Vegas with his wife, Aja Volkman of Nico Vega, and their 4-year-old daughter, Arrow. The couple is also expecting twin daughters in mid-April. Imagine Dragons is gearing up for a brand new release, having put out its first single, “Believer,” in January. Though the band hasn’t announced any proper U.S. tour dates, it will be performing as part of the Zedd-curated ACLU benefit at Staples Center, also featuring Skrillex, Bebe Rexha, Daya, Halsey, Incubus and more, in Los Angeles on April 3.The new album, he said still doesn’t have a release date, but will contain much more positive content than its previous effort.“The artwork for the single is a picture by this artist named Beeple and it’s of a man kind of in this vast empty space and he’s arriving at a place of color with vibrant lights coming down from the sky,” Reynolds described. “That, to me, symbolized the transition I’ve taken in my own life from ‘Smoke + Mirrors’ to where I am now and that’s a place that’s much more vibrant and colorful. I found a lot of mental and physical health in this last year and did a lot of work to get there. Now I’m just in a place where I can reflect and I’m grateful for what I went through and will continue to go through because it’s a lifelong process.”" True text

During half of the video it was just acting, but on the other half we really did some fighting, you can see it in the video. The single is kind of a positive anthem, both in the lyrics and the sound. When did you write it? About six months ago. In this song I think about the past and some hard times, which anyway allowed me to find the motivation to go on. Talking about dark times, you recently publicly talked about your illness. Not an easy choice, I guess. I’m not someone who talks about his private life but you come to a point where the situation is so overwhelming that I couldn’t hold it in. It was influencing my job, we had to cancel some shows and I had to give explanations to my fans. When I got on the stage I was so in pain that I couldn’t get to the end. I talked clearly? Saying “hey, this is what’s happening”. Furthermore, I find it right to talk about illnesses that people know little about, we need to create awareness to make everything better. Smoke and Mirrors is about this, besides talking about the depression I went through. But now everything is different, my illness got better and I mentally feel renewed. Is it also thanks to religion? You were raised in a mormon family, what is you approach with faith? I’d say I took a step back regarding the concept of religion. I consider myself a very spiritual person, I went through kind of a spiritual chrisis in the past, I was looking for answers that I couldn’t have. Now I stopped questioning myself and I enjoy this rediscovered peace. And if the first single represents the album, I guess we’ll be able to see this tranquillity in the new work. Absolutely, it’s a “colored” album. It talks a lot about love, which we haven’t talked about that much before. It’s an album that celebrates life. The tour starts in April, you have dates all over the world. How are you getting ready? We aren’t getting ready! (Laughs). More than that we are drawing the scenography, but we really have to start rehearsing. You know, it’s one of those things that always seem so far and when it’s closed you start getting scared. Don’t worry by the way, we’ll do great!" True link

Does it begin with a melody, a hook, a lyric?REYNOLDS: Every song is different, and everyone contributes in their own way. A song may start from a beat, a guitar riff or a chord progression. Maybe even a word.What inspired the new single, “Believer”? REYNOLDS: The song is about overcoming emotional and physical pain to arrive at a place of peace and self-confidence.Where did the idea for the video come from, and what made you decide to include Dolph Lundgren? REYNOLDS: The video shows a man battling shadows of himself. We came up with the idea for this metaphorical representation of the song with Matt [Eastin], our director. Dolph was the perfect guy for the role. Not just because he’s a great actor and martial artist. He also does look a lot like an older, much, much stronger me [laughs].What was the filming process like? REYNOLDS: It was one of the most fun film shoots we’ve ever done. The set was beautiful and there really weren’t any unexpected problems, which is weird on a music video set. I got rocked pretty good on some of those hits, though.You mentioned Matt Eastin, who you’ve worked with several times in the past. What was it like working with him again? REYNOLDS: There’s nothing better than working with a director that you know and trust. Filming is a much less stressful process when you know that it’s going to look great on camera. Matt has a great eye but also understands the way we think and is super detail oriented.Wayne, who were/are some of your main guitar influences? SERMON: That’s hard for me to answer, and I feel like it shouldn’t be. I grew up on classic rock, so all your usual suspects, I guess. But if I had to name a few, Tom Scholz [Boston] for his OCD level recording techniques, George Harrison for always serving the song and Jimmy Page for, well, being Jimmy Page. All of them had a big impact on my playing. I studied a lot of jazz at school and discovered Bill Frisell in college. He probably has the best feel of any guitarist I’ve ever heard.What’s the best bit of advice you can give to an aspiring guitarist?SERMON: Honestly, worry a ton less about being a virtuoso and focus a lot more on creating a part that perfectly fits the song. Additionally, don’t listen to anyone else about gear, just find what inspires you and makes you want to play. For some people, that’s a cheap fuzz pedal plugged straight into a solid-state amp, and for other people, it’s three racks of gear. I’m still trying to follow my own advice.What is your current setup like? Is there a guitar/amp combination you prefer when you play live?SERMON: This is proof that I can’t follow my own advice [laughs]. I run three early Sixties Vox AC30’s in a wet/dry/wet scenario. All my pedals are in racks and I use Eventide H7600’s for time-based stuff. In my defense, it’s a pretty damn inspiring thing to play through. I’ve been a hopeless gearhead my whole life. Finally being able to do this kind of setup is a dream for me.Can you tell me the origin of the song, “Demons” and how the track all came together? SERMON: Dan writes all the lyrics. They’re straight from his brain and whatever he was going through at the time. We worked with Alex da Kid on that song. He has an amazing sense of drum sounds and affects them in awesome ways. I added my guitars last, trying to add texture to the pre-chorus and chorus without cluttering.What are you most looking forward to about this next phase of your career? SERMON: Finally being able to share this new music. It’s been incubating for years, and now is the fun part!" True link
