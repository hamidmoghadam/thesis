Might as well start putting hospitals on Yelp and Tripadvisor.   Our system focuses too much on patient satisfaction and less on medical skill. Less about doing what is necessary to improve someone’s medical state and more about doing everything in our power to keep them happy. And worse is Administration across the country is all about this model of practice. So the healthcare systems slap down regulation after regulation to automize us basically turning us into robots.

But when it comes to a point that getting a bad review because we forgot to bring you water due to the fact another patient was actively dying, and then we get more of a lecturing about the negative review instead of figuring out what we could of done better for the other patient…is absurd to me.

Next we proceeded into her exam.  The stigmata for bacterial infection were conspicuously absent.  I described my findings to her, watching her mood deflate slightly when I explained that antibiotics would not help.  I continued to work my way down her body in a systematic exam, explaining as I went.  As I came to her hands I winced.  The skin was thickened, dried, and cracked.  My hands began to hurt in sympathy. “Tell me about your hands,” I said. She responded in deeply accented English that her hands became like this after working with the nail chemicals all day.  “And do you like this job?” I asked. “I hate it,” she responded.  I continued to inquire why, if she hated her job and it hurt her skin in such a terrible way, she did not seek other employment.  “In my country I was a nurse.  But here I would have to start schooling over.  It would take twice as long because I would first have to take English classes.” She continued to explain that when coming over, many Vietnamese people worked in nail salons because that is where other Vietnamese people worked.  In other words, it was one of the few places they could get a foot in the door as untrained workers who barely spoke discernible English.  Suddenly the Dat Phan comedy bit seemed a lot less funny. “Why come to the U.S.?”  I asked.  “If you were a nurse in Vietnam, why immigrate to a place with few job opportunities.” Her answer?  She makes more here as a nail technician than a nurse in Vietnam, meaning she can send money to her family at home.  And being here gives her two teenage children a better opportunity for employment as they grow up.  In short, this woman gave up a job she enjoyed, to work in conditions she hates, in order for her family to have opportunities she never could. Long after I wrote her note and sent her on her way, my Vietnamese patient lingered in my mind.  Interestingly, the more I thought the more I realized she did fit into a stereotype, although I had placed her in the wrong one.  Perhaps it is partially true to think that many Vietnamese immigrants are nail technicians.  But I think the better way to look at immigrants, in all flavors, is with the lens of selfless hope they often bring with them, rather than the employment circumstances they often find themselves in.  She, like the most tremendous among us, gave up her life goals in order to propel her family into a new socioeconomic class.  That to me doesn’t fit the image the media promotes for immigrants, but rather the image I think of when I see working class mothers struggling for their family’s sake.  And I think that stereotype, an example of the best that people have to offer, is a stereotype I can live with.   Reminds me of a post I saw somewhere on Tumblr: Hands up for our parents that came to America with nothing and gave us everything.   Yes to all this, AND let’s be careful not to fall into the belief that it’s possible for every immigrant, or every ghetto-ized person of color to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps. We need a living wage, fair housing, health care for all, truly equitable education, and much more for folks at all levels of our very steep pyramid.

Today my attending and I called a patient’s bother and power of attorney.  We explained to him that his brother (who had multiple serious medical comorbidities) had been found in cardiac arrest after an unknown period of time, and while the paramedics had gotten his heart to start beating again, he was in very grave condition and given his multiple other health problems, we didn’t know what his chances for recovery looked like or what his quality of life would be if he did. The brother stopped us.  “I’m a doctor in (Town a few hours away)”, he said, “And he’s been miserable these past few years, being as sick as he is and going through the treatment he did.  He wouldn’t want this.  I’m leaving to drive there as soon as I hang up, but I want you to take the tube out, put him on comfort care, and if he starts to die before I get there, let him go.  Don’t put the tube back in, don’t start pressors, don’t do CPR, just let him go, I don’t want him to suffer any more for my sake.” I can only imagine how hard that must’ve been for him. We would’ve completely understood if he’d wanted us to keep his brother intubated until he got here and could be with him as he died, but he wanted us to make and keep him comfortable, instead. If my brother is ever (heaven forbid) in that same situation and I have to make a decision, I hope I’d have the compassion and strength to tell his docs to put his comfort first and foremost, let his death progress as naturally as it could, get in a car, and accept that I may not get there in time to see him alive again, but feel it is worth it so I can spare him some suffering.

I noticed that doctors tend to have certain lines or go-to phrases they say when they address different issues in the conversation, so I’m wondering if medblrs can reblog this and add some of the things they like to say when taking a history.  (Nurblr responses are welcome too, as are signal boosts, thanks! 😊)  I just learned this too!! Would love to hear about other medblrs tips and tricks!! Any advice @wayfaringmd @pedsblr @surrealmeds @cranquis @imaresident @md-admissions @mymedlife and any other medblrs out there?!  When suspecting prostatitis as a cause for symptoms, I don’t jump to asking questions about erectile dysfunction, loss of libido, and urinary obstructive symptoms right away. First, I ask the guy if he knows what his prostate is, and then I give a brief description of the prostate: “It’s basically a racquetball wrapped around the pee-tube coming out from your bladder, and it’s also next-door neighbors with your rectum. If it’s enlarged or sick, it can block your urine flow, and it can jack up your sex function. So that’s why I’m going to ask you these questions.” THEN, when they start pinging lots of +’s on the prostate symptoms (and, I suspect, answering them more honestly because they know what I’m getting at), I add this: “Well, sure sounds like your prostate could be the cause of your X symptoms, doesn’t it? So now, we need to feel it and see if it’s swollen or tender. Now that you’re an expert on prostates, can you guess how we examine it?” Believe it or not, my male patients seem to be overall less embarrassed and apprehensive about digital rectal exams if THEY are the first one in the room to say “finger in the butthole”… because by that point, they understand WHY it’s important to do this.   Never ask “are you missing any doses,” but rather “how often do you miss a dose?” Nobody is perfect. Let’s acknowledge that so your patient doesn’t feel like they have to lie.  When you run out of questions or blank out, always feel free to ask “is there anything else you think I should know that I haven’t asked?” It will give you a few more seconds to think.  In regards to pain complaints, always ask “what were you doing when it started?” It may be useless, but you’d be surprised how often you see people for neck pain who have no clue what caused it and when you ask that question they say “painting my ceiling”. I usually start my preventive care visits with “I’m going to ask you a bunch of nosy personal questions today so I can figure out what sort of diseases you might be at risk for. If at any time you think I’ve gone too far, please tell me, or if you have a question why I would ask about XYZ, please ask.”  When asking about anxiety, I usually ask people how they feel physically when they’re really anxious. I will explain that my heart beats extra hard and fast when I’m anxious, whereas some people get an upset stomach or shortness of breath. Often that helps zoom in on some somatic issues.  If a person has a series of vague complaints or they come in for fatigue, always always ask about sleep habits. Patients will roll their eyes and say they sleep fine and then admit they sleep 4 hours a night because they keep checking Facebook all night.  If you’re asking about a distance, like how far a person can walk before they have to stop and rest, try using relative terms like “from this room to the front desk” or “across the Walmart parking lot” rather than accurate distances like 100 yards or a half mile. Folks often don’t have much perspective on how far 100 feet is.  Also: I second Cranquis’ use of basic, easy to understand terms like “pee tube” and “jack up your sex function”. You and the patient will both know what you mean. However, when a patient uses vague terms like “my down-there” areas or “my privates,” make sure you can get them to be more specific. For example, if a woman complains of pelvic pain, specify is it deep in the abdomen like menstrual cramps, on the skin outside the vagina like a rash, inside the vagina like a yeast infection, etc.  That’s alls I can think of right now.  My addition is related to asking about mental health. My program (stupidly) focuses on not using the words “mental health” or “psychiatrist” when asking about history of depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, etc. because of the “stigma” associated with having to see a mental health professional. I find this extremely ironic because their approach to lessening the stigma associated with mental healthcare is by trying to tiptoe around it by asking questions like “Have you ever seen anyone for in the past for any sort of anxiety or depression?” The problem with asking about a mental health history in this manner is that it leaves out a multitude of other reasons someone may have seen a therapist, psychiatrist, or counselor. All aspects of mental health are extremely important, and by focusing on only two diagnoses (anxiety and depression) I feel that leaves out a lot of other conditions my patient might have, ranging from schizophrenia to arousal disorders.  So, what I usually ask is, “At any point in your life have you seen a mental health professional or counselor for any reason?” And it shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Not for you. Not for the patient. I have never once had a patient get offended by me asking about their mental health history. I hate this idea that we can’t say “mental health” because of the stigma associated with the phrase “mental health.” We won’t get rid of a stigma by avoiding the phrase entirely. If anything it just worsens it.   This thread keeps getting better and better. Check out the entry by @md-admissions in a separate reblog too.   This is fantastic! I’ll add some peds stuff because that’s what I’m on right now: –if your patient is old enough to talk, ask them who they brought with them. Like, point at the adult in the room and say “who is that?” It gives you a ton of insight into their social situation without having to ask awkward questions–for example, the person you may have assumed was mom is actually auntie and now you have a perfect opening to casually ask where mom is. It’s also fantastic because kids will always say things like “that’s Dad,” and you also call the father ‘Dad,’ which is a cheap but effective way to get a laugh out of a school age kids. –when you’re asking about developmental history, especially in the inpatient/urgent care/ER seeing, ask if anyone has ever been concerned about the child’s growth or development. It’s a quick way to assess for any major issues, then you can go through age-appropriate screening as needed. A surprisingly high number of people have told me that, yeah, little Johnny did need speech therapy for a year now that you think about it.  –Social history in teens is super awkward, always. I start the conversation by asking about what their friends are doing–kids are much more likely to admit that their friends are drinking than tell you about their own drinking habits. It also gives you a great judgement-free avenue for education–you can talk about stupid things their friends have done while drinking and how to avoid them while still reinforcing to the teen that drinking can be dangerous.  This is beautiful. Keep on keeping on!" False text

(Image caption:  Astrocytes are shedding light on neurodegeneration caused by a range of diseases) Astrocytes  have long been implicated in the pathology of a range of human  neurodegenerative diseases or injuries including Alzheimer’s,  Huntington’s Parkinson’s disease, brain trauma and spinal cord injury. But how they are produced and what their roles in disease may be, has been as yet unknown. This paper  provides an understanding of the mechanism involved and for the first  time provides hope that a lot of these diseases may in fact be  treatable. The study, published recently in Nature and led by  researchers at The University of Melbourne and Stanford University,  provides deeper understanding of the functions of injured or  diseased astrocytes found in the Central Nervous System (CNS) following  acute injury and chronic neurodegenerative disease. In a healthy brain, astrocytes are vital for the normal functioning  of the brain - providing nutrients to support neuron viability,  releasing factors that aid formation of connections between nerve  cells known as synapses, as well as many other important functions. One puzzle has been that in some circumstances the astrocytes appear  to have a toxic effect on neurons, whereas in others they support  neuronal viability and connectivity. Researcher Dr Shane Liddelow from the University of Melbourne’s  Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, and the Department of  Neurobiology at Stanford University, said astrocytes are often  characterised as ‘helper’ cells but they can also contribute to damage  caused by brain injury and disease by turning toxic and kill other types  of brain cells. “These apparently opposing effects have been a puzzle for some time.  By characterising two types of astrocytes this paper provides some  answers to the puzzle,” he said. “Following nerve damage, astrocytes form scar tissue that can help in  the regeneration of severed fibres. But we have also discovered that  under certain conditions, they can turn and become negatively reactive,  causing cell death,” Dr Liddelow said For many decades, the trauma and neurodegeneration research focus has  been on neurons. Researchers are excited by the discovery of these  neurotoxic reactive astrocytes, because for the first time, these  findings imply that acute injuries of the retina, brain and spinal cord  and chronic neurodegenerative diseases, may all be much more treatable  and even reversible than first thought. By providing new insights into the process of neurodegeneration,  researchers can look at new pathways for dealing with neurological  diseases and injuries, by targetting these toxic astrocytes, in addition  to neurones in neuropsychiatric diseases or oligodendrocytes as for  instance in multiple sclerosis. Ultimately, there is still hope that one day it may be possible to  switch back astrocytes from the “toxic” to the “helper” state, a long  term target for Dr. Liddelow and colleagues. " False text

Begin studying early, with an hour or two per day, and slowly build as the exam approaches.  2. ‘I’ve Got So Much to Study…And so Little Time"" Preview. Survey your syllabus, reading material, and notes. Identify the most important topics emphasized, and areas still not understood. Previewing saves time, by helping you organize and focus in on the main topics.  3. “This Stuff is so Dry, I can’t Even Stay Awake Reading It” Get actively involved with the text as you read. Ask yourself, “What is important to remember about this section?” Take notes or underline key concepts. Discuss the material with others in your class. Stay on the offensive.  4. “I Read It. I Understand It. But I Just Can’t Get it To Sink In” Elaborate. We remember best the things that are most meaningful to us. As you are reading, try to elaborate upon new information with your own examples. Try to integrate what you’re studying with what you already know. You will be able to remember new material better if you can link it to something that’s already meaningful to you.  Chunking: Example: to remember the colors in the visible spectrum, Rog G.Biv –> reduce the information the three “chunks”. Mnemonics: Associate new information with something familiar.  5. “I Guess I Understand It” Test yourself. Make up questions about key sections in notes or reading. Examine the relationships between concepts and sections. Often, imply by changing section headings you can generate many effective questions. 6. “There’s Too Much to Remember” Organize. Information is recalled better if it is represented in an organized framework that will make retrieval more systematic.  Write chapter outlines of summaries; emphasize relationships between sections.  Group information into categories or hierarchies, where possible. Information Mapping. Draw up a matrix to organize and interrelate material.  7. “I Knew It A Minute Ago” Review. After reading a section, try to recall the information contained in it. Try answering the questions you made up for that section. If you cannot recall enough, re-read portions you had trouble remembering. The more time you spend studying, the more you tend to recall. Even after the point where information can be perfectly recalled, further study makes the material less likely to be forgotten entirely. How you organize and integrate new information is still more important than how much time you spend studying.    For more follow How To Study Quick!!  " False text

It is perfectly possible to look beyond  this unfortunate circumstance and find inspiration, even in an  oxymoronic sense. I seek not to lighten the seriousness of depression,  but to lighten the burden imposed on those fighting it. To those who can  relate, your journey is unique and may differ from mine, but  remember that there is always a silver lining. A negatively charged  electron inherently attracts a positive proton as the universe moves  toward equilibrium. As such, it is the hardships and the sufferings we  face as both medical students and human beings that bring out the best  qualities in us and help mold the physician that we eventually become.”Mollika Hossain at Florida State University College of Medicine talks about the silver lining in medicine when battling depression."

Yes, the people I was  with and the environment I was cooking in was excellent, but I was most  pleasantly surprised by the addition of a new skill into my repertoire —  how to make tasty and nutritious treats. Cooking is quite an  undervalued skill and knowing at least a couple of nifty recipes that  take less than 15 minutes will be valuable to you as a medical student  and even beyond. If for only that reason, I’d highly recommend everyone  take a cooking class at some point. It’s fun, useful, and makes for a  satisfied stomach at the end of the evening. Bon appetite!”Neha Kumar at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine discusses her newest adventure in the Mind Your Mind series by telling us about her experience with a cooking class."

A boy so young, his dreams adventures drive, Was given power over people’s lives.He bore a gun on back and hand on tags As stood he looking over body bags. A knife at hip suggests the lives they take. But, many other times his hands did shake.He turned away; so tight he shut his heart. Resolve was clear in eyes so wide and dark. If failed he bringing the assigned to death, His younger brother’d draw a martyr’s breath.In steadfast manner, now he turned and marched, Just wanting life devoid of loss—unparched. The final day of judgment: faced he strife. They shot and left for dead—inclement life.He cried… He cried for parents now departed—gone.His parents’ warlords forced his hand to kill, And now a warlord threatened siblings still.He cried again for loving sister’s war: A sister raped and made to suffer more.He further cried for beaten brother prized Who, living life, will suffer—pain devised.And then, he cried at length for now himself: A worthless boy, his deep regrets on shelf.Of God, he asked, “Why let my people fear?” The answer made not, though, the water clear.He closed his eyes, surrendered life—his lease And slept without a worry troubling—peace. He knew his time on Earth was over—done— And nothing more will change this tale so spun.”A poem by Srihari Govind at Mahatma Gandhi Medical College and Research Institute, Pondicherry." True link

If a  proposed social situation does not seem safe and secure, it may be  necessary to dig deeper, below a veneer of plausibility. By taking the  time to observe organic relationships unfold, you can relay a more  cohesive social picture to the social worker, act as a resource for our  patients and advocate for a secure and realistic safety plan.
