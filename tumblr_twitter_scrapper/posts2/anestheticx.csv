If you have weight insecurities, the abuser will poke fun of your weight and constantly point out people who are skinner than you.    2.  Who is “You”?  Many abusers think and act as if they know everything about you, right down to your thoughts. If you try to claim the latter, they will assume you are lying (whether they are vocal about it or not). They might even try to convince you that you are lying to yourself.   3.  The Meaning of “Normal” Changes   This is one of the most obvious signs of gaslighting. If someone tries to tell you something is normal when you think it is wrong, you need to get out of that relationship.  This is like if a person does not want to take the next step in a relationship and is called a prude rather than accepting their comfort levels.

Consider a snapshot of the situation young people face: the unemployment rate for workers under age 25 is 18.1 percent; unemployment for black people who have not graduated from high school is 82.5 percent; the people most likely to be shot by police are black 25–34-year-olds; the national student loan debt has surpassed $1 trillion; and the only jobs lucrative enough to pay off college loans are in the financial industry that detonated our economy or Silicon Valley companies deregulating working-class industries.  The future doesn’t hold much hope either, with median household income declining 12.4 percent between 2000 and 2011. Having a family is simply harder to afford now. Meanwhile, each new year sets another low record for union density, meaning we have few levers for turning those income numbers around. Unlike most wealthy countries, the United States lacks universal childcare and maternity leave, so women are stuck with the same old debates over an impossible work-life balance.  We were told that in the knowledge economy good jobs followed higher education; there are few jobs, and we lock ourselves into miserable ones as quickly as possible to feed the loan sharks. The magazine writers who report on self-indulgent 20-somethings (think Time’s “The Me Me Me Generation” cover), the well-meaning guidance counselors who coach kids to “invest in themselves”—they should save their breath. You don’t need a college course to know when you’re getting screwed.  The most grotesque feature of the 2016 election is the razor-thin spectrum of solutions proposed by the front-runners to a historic set of problems. Lost in the noise of the 2016 election cycle is the fact that no viable candidate offers any hope for a radically more equal society: The policies on offer would merely mitigate the dire inequality that has been growing since Reagan. And this is despite the fact that a majority of Americans express widespread discontent with the country’s extreme consolidation of wealth: about three in four Americans think that inequality is a serious problem in the United States. (This places Americans in the mainstream of world opinion, where in all 44 nations polled by Pew, people think inequality is a big problem facing their countries.) It is this popular dissatisfaction that no doubt accounts for the unexpected surge of support for the unlikely long-shot Democratic candidate, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, an avowed socialist. Indeed, the most obvious source of this election’s futility is that popular opinion, expressed through elections, has essentially proved to have no influence on policy. According to a now-famous 2014 Princeton and Northwestern study measuring influence in American politics, “economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy, while mass-based interest groups and average citizens have little or no independent influence.” On key issues like gun control, financial reform, and education spending, the policy-makers’ divergence from popular opinion has been particularly stark. The United States is now, in effect, an oligarchy. Beyond this sad reckoning lies an even more fundamental problem: There is no better alternative on offer. We need a vision of a better future, one that turns our modern capacity for abundant food, shelter, and health into a guarantee that no one will suffer for their lack. So when people demand that we vote, you can see why the answer comes back: For what? The economic crash was not just an ugly fluctuation that we’re all trying in good faith to correct. It has provided cover for neoliberal benefit rollbacks—cutting government services in the name of budget crises—in which all of these candidates have participated. Vulnerable people who need the services the most get screwed first: the young, the old, the poor. Eligibility for unemployment benefits has been tightened and opportunities to extend them rejected because we “can’t afford them.”    A college education is edging beyond reach for many of us. In 2012, Congress restricted Pell grants for low-income college students. While national student debt has surpassed $1 trillion, the federal government has made it impossible to default on these college loans—even your Social Security can be garnished to pay them off.   And before students even make it to college, they are subjected to schools with such attenuated budgets that physicians have started prescribing Adderall to poor kids to keep them focused in unruly classrooms, whether they have ADD or not. In the words of one doctor, “We’ve decided as a society that it’s too expensive to modify the kid’s environment. So we have to modify the kid.”      Perhaps it’s wise to modify the kid for the brave new world that will await her: one with constantly shifting and disappearing jobs and no safety net of any kind. It is a truism now that no one expects one career. Most people now in college or high school will have six jobs by the time they’re 26. And let us not mistake flexible work for fulfilling work. This is an age when the power of the boss is so ascendant over the power of the worker that we can be shuffled around to match precisely the needs of capital.   (Continue Reading) " False link

They also come in two styles – a crop top length and a tank top length – and in sizes XXS to 5XL.  “At gc2b we aim to continue to accommodate and celebrate the vast spectrum of humanity, to always serve and liberate our phenomenal supporters, and as always, to design with the true you in mind,” gc2b, who Mic has reached out to for comment, writes on its website.  Although some designers on Etsy have attempted to create their own more inclusive lines with more shades of nude, such as LeoLines, this is the first time an established and trusted brand has expanded its range.  Underworks, a binder company that has been around since 1997, still only stocks binders in the current usual array of colors. FLAVNT Streetwear has a line of binding swim tops in five different shades in the works as well, but those haven’t yet hit the market.  It matters that a binder company is already trusted for the simple reason that chest binding can be quite dangerous. “I essentially liken binding to drinking a can of Coke,” Jessie Anderson, who is transgender, said in a previous interview. “Is it good for you?

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said on MSNBC’s “All In with Chris Hayes” on Friday night. “And I’ll be introducing legislation shortly to do that.”Even  before the Republicans withdrew their Obamacare repeal bill, Rep. Keith  Ellison (D-Minn.), the deputy chair of the Democratic National  Committee and a close Sanders ally, previewed this message at a rally in defense of Obamacare on Thursday.“Don’t  just be satisfied with defeating Trumpcare ― set your sights on  creating real Medicare for all!” he told a cheering crowd of hundreds of  activists.Representatives  of several major progressive organizations ― the Working Families  Party, the Progressive Campaign Change Committee, Credo, Social Security  Works and the National Nurses United ― all echoed this push in  conversations with The Huffington Post on Friday and Saturday.“The  problem is the insurance companies, Big Pharma ― they’re gonna come  back and use the chaos to their advantage,” predicted Social Security  Works executive director Alex Lawson. “If Democrats go with a  half-a-loaf policy, Republicans are going to blame them for the failures  of Big Pharma. They have to immediately pivot to expanding Medicare.”Notwithstanding the support of the influential groups for the proposal and ― according to a May 2016 Gallup poll ― even a majority of the American people, Medicare-for-all legislation is a non-starter in the current Congress. Single-payer health insurance still lacks support from many, if not most, Democrats, let alone from the Republican lawmakers who control both chambers.Read more. Now is the time for expanded health care. The Bernie Revolution rolls on. The whole article, if anyone cares to actually read beyond the headline, is why medicare for all is a non starter and how some progressives don’t even want to entertain the idea of repairing and reforming ACA coz it’s not medicare for all. There are sick and dying people while both left and right play ideological politics on healthcare, instead of going for practical solutions - improving & expanding ACA - that will save more lives sooner."

According to local news reports, centers in New York, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Texas and Alabama were targeted.  “It appears to be the same serial caller” as in the prior incidents, Goldenberg told JTA. Goldenberg said that some of the JCCs were evacuated and others were not. “The JCCs are very well-equipped to handle this,” he said. Goldenberg did not confirm where any of the threats occurred, saying they took place across the country and that his office “is monitoring the situation.” Goldenberg said the fact that the threats were made on Presidents Day, when more people might be in the buildings during the daytime, does not appear to be a factor in the threats. Last week, President Donald Trump was asked during a news conference about the prior JCC bomb threats and what the government’s response would be to “an uptick in anti-Semitism.” Although the reporter did not suggest Trump was anti-Semitic, the president answered by denying he is an anti-Semite and called the question “insulting.” The Harry & Rose Samson Family Jewish Community Center in Whitefish Bay, Milwaukee was evacuated Monday morning after receiving  threatening phone calls, the Journal Sentinel reported.

My day job is the chairman and the  co-founder of Thorn. We built software to fight human trafficking and  the sexual exploitation of children. My other day job is that of the  father of two, a 2-month old and 2-year-old.” Kutcher, 39, shares daughter Wyatt and son Dimitri with wife Mila Kunis. He then described joining the FBI in raids in India, Russia, Mexico and stateside in New Jersey and New York. “I’ve seen things that no person should ever see,” he said, tearing  up. “I’ve seen video content of a child that is the same age as mine  being raped by an American man that was a sex tourist in Cambodia. This  child was so conditioned by her environment that she thought she was  engaging in play.” He continued, “I’ve been on the other end of a phone call from my team  asking for my help because we had received a call from the Department of  Homeland Security, telling us that a 7-year-old girl was being sexually  abused and that content was being spread on the Dark Web … They’d  watched her for three years and they could not find the perpetrator, [and were] asking us for help. We were the last line of defense. An actor and his foundation were the last line of defense.” “I had to say no and it devastated me, it haunted me,” Kutcher said,  choking up again. “For the next three months I had to go to sleep every  night and think about that little girl that was being abused and the  fact that if I built the right thing, we could have saved her. Now, if I  got that phone call, the answer would be yes.” He then recalled the story of “Amy,” a 15-year-old girl from Oakland,  Calif., who was forced into trafficking within hours of meeting a man  in person she’d first talked to online. “This isn’t an isolated  incident. There’s not much that’s unusual about it,” Kutcher said. “The  only unusual thing is that ‘Amy’ was found and returned to her family  within three days using a tool we created … called Spotlight.” Kutcher said the tool aids police in cutting investigation time by 60  percent, adding, “That’s my day job and I’m sticking to it.” It wasn’t all heavy: Kutcher and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) had a lighthearted moment after his speech. “You were better looking in the movies,” McCain said. Kutcher, blowing McCain, 80, a kiss, replied, “My wife says that, too.””  Slavery is still alive and well in the world, and he is helping to stamp it out.  Well damn, I’ll give Kutcher credit.  He’s a good man. Glad this is now his day job. He’s good at it. This is the type of shit that other celebs should do, rather than whine and virtue signal.  Agreed. Use those millions for something real, not for virtue signalling.  Pair him up with Keanu Reeves and let the bodies hit the floor. Make it happen, Tumblr. " False link

It is strange behavior really. And yet, it is not so strange when we consider that we have been conditioned to believe that who we are is our self-story, the carefully constructed version of me that we have assimilated over a lifetime.  And simultaneously, we are conditioned to believe that our self can be altered, harmed and ultimately annihilated by another’s experience of us, particularly when that experience is inconsistent with our self-story. No wonder we are so afraid and defensive when conflict arises! While our conditioning has taught us that who we are is remarkably fragile, in truth, who we are is fiercer than anything we know.     The next time the opportunity to know another’s experience presents, try out what it feels like to listen without strategizing to keep yourself positively positioned—without defending the story of who you are and what you have or have not done.  See if you feel worse or better.   If only for a moment, fire yourself as the client of your own public relations campaign—surrender your title as your own brand manager.  Connection is not born from successfully proving that you are a good person, coming out looking like a good person, or being right.  When you make use of another’s suffering to champion your identity, you indeed emerge as a champion me. Despite all the effort however, your true identity remains isolated. You go home with your badge of rightness, your champion ego, while the experience of love and connection are lost.
