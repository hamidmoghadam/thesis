The song has been translated into several languages (German, French, Basque, Occitan, Corsican…), and in some places it’s believed that it’s a traditional song from the area. In Poland, the song is called Mury (same chords but different lyrics). It’s a song against the Spanish dictatorship, which was about to die when the song was written. It also has a nationalist meaning, and tells how people must fight to get rid of Spain and France.The song has become a symbol of the fight for freedom.L'avi Siset em parlava de bon matí al portal The old Siset talked to me on the porch during dawnmentre el sol esperàvem i els carros vèiem passar. while we waited for the sun and saw the carts pass by.Siset, que no veus l'estaca on estem tots lligats? Siset, don’t you see the stake to which we’re all tied?Si no podem desfer-nos-en mai no podrem caminar! If we can’t get rid of it, we’ll never be able to walk!Si estirem tots, ella caurà i molt de temps no pot durar. If we all pull, it will fall, and it won’t endure for long.Segur que tomba, tomba, tomba, ben corcada deu ser ja.It will fall, fall, fall, it must be already quite rotten.  Si tu l’estires for per aquí, i jo l’estiro fort per allàIf you pull hard from here, and I pull hard from theresegur que tomba, tomba, tomba, i ens podrem alliberar. then it will fall, fall, fall, and we will liberate ourselves.Però, Siset, fa molt temps ja, les mans se’m van escorxant, But, Siset, so much time has passed, my hands are flayed,i quan la força se me'n va ella és més ampla i més gran. and when I have no strength left, it (the stake) is wider and bigger.Ben cert sé que està podrida però és que, Siset, pesa tant, I know that it’s rotten, but it’s just, Siset, that it weighs so muchque a cops la força m'oblida. Torna’m a dir el teu cant: that sometimes the strength leaves*. Tell me your song again:Si estirem tots, ella caurà i molt de temps no pot durar. If we all pull, it will fall and it won’t last for longSegur que tomba, tomba, tomba, ben corcada deu ser ja. I’m sure it will fall, fall, fall, it must be already quite rottenSi jo l'estiro fort per aquí i tu l'estires fort per allà, If I pull hard from here and you pull hard from there,segur que tomba, tomba, tomba, i ens podrem alliberar. I’m sure it will fall, fall, fall, and we will be free.L'avi Siset ja no diu res, mal vent que se l'emportà, The old Siset now says nothing, a bad wind took him awayell qui sap cap a quin indret i jo a sota el portal. He, who knows where to go, and I’m under the porch.I mentre passen els nous vailets estiro el coll per cantar And while the new lads pass by, I stretched my neck to singel darrer cant d'en Siset, el darrer que em va ensenyar. the last song of Siset, the last one that he taught me.Si estirem tots, ella caurà i molt de temps no pot durar. If we all pull, it will fall and it won’t last for longSegur que tomba, tomba, tomba, ben corcada deu ser ja. I’m sure that it will fall, fall, fall, it must already be quite rotten.Si jo l'estiro fort per aquí i tu l'estires fort per allà, If I pull hard from here and you pull hard from there,segur que tomba, tomba, tomba, i ens podrem alliberar.it will fall, fall, fall and we’ll be free.*oblidar means to forget, but here it’d mean “to leave” " True text

That’s all well and good, but for those of us who are looking to learn modern Greek it’s not terribly helpful.  With that in mind I’ve compiled a list of the materials that I found in my quest to self-study Greek that began in earnest about 1.5 years ago. Now keep in mind I had an excellent teacher (my girlfriend) who also served as my motivation, but even if you don’t have a close relationship with a Greek speaker you will at some point need to interact with proficient speakers to help move you to the next level of fluency. However, the materials I outlined here should be enough to give you a very good start.  Learning Greek podcasts from the Hellenic American Union: The go-to audio-visual resource.  80 lessons (all FREE) with accompanying PDF transcripts.  Be warned it’s ALL Greek, not a lick of English (or anything else) in it, so you’ll need a dictionary/textbook to go with it.  Teach Yourself Greek: The Greek edition of the venerable textbook series.  Definitely worth a look.  Memrise: There are a surprising number of really good Modern Greek-English flashcard sets on Memrise (which uses a spaced repetition algorithm that I found very effective).   Wordreference: King of the online dictionaries, at least in terms of variety   Neurolingo Lexiscope: See a word in Greek but can’t work out its uninflected form?  This is the tool for you (only 10 free searches a day, though, last I checked)   Modern Greek Verbs: Everything you ever wanted to know about Modern Greek verbs.  Seriously, everything.   Greek Grammar: Excellent overviews of the main grammatical points of the Greek parts of speech   Harry Foundalis’ Greek Language: Harry’s a bit of a renaissance man, which is awesome.  His way of explaining verbal aspect in Modern Greek I found less awesome until I warmed to it, but that’s just me: I like the technical, linguistics jargon filled explanations coupled with charts of patterns and examples. Once I got past the presentation I could see what he was doing and it has a certain brilliance.  The rest of his grammar (and phonetics) stuff is top notch.   Cooljugator: Conjugates most common Greek verbs.  These resources, watching lots of Greek TV (thank you, YouTube) and listening to lots of Greek music (thank you YouTube again), and practicing constantly (thank you to my girlfriend) took me from zero to fairly fluent in about 1.5 years.  Now, I already spoke a lot of languages and I had help, so your results may vary, but this should be a good start on your Greek learning journey.

African leaders are seeking ways to feed their peoples and become players in the global economy.In the second edition of The New Harvest: Agricultural Innovation in Africa, I argue that Africa can feed itself in a generation. However, efforts to achieve such an ambitious goal continue to be frustrated by policies adopted by Africa’s historical trading partners, especially the European Union.There are at least three ways in which EU policies affect Africa’s ability to address its agricultural and food challenges: tariff escalation; technological innovation and food export preferences.African leaders would like to escape the colonial trap of being viewed simply as raw material exporters. But their efforts to add value to the materials continue to be frustrated by existing EU policies.Take the example of coffee. In 2014 Africa —the home of coffee— earned nearly $2.4 billion from the crop. Germany, a leading processor, earned about $3.8 billion from coffee re-exports.The concern is not that Germany benefits from processing coffee. It is that Africa is punished by EU tariff barriers for doing so. Non-decaffeinated green coffee is exempt from the charges. However, a 7.5 per cent charge is imposed on roasted coffee. As a result, the bulk of Africa’s export to the EU is unroasted green coffee.The charge on cocoa is even more debilitating. It is reported that the “EU charges (a tariff) of 30 per cent for processed cocoa products like chocolate bars or cocoa powder, and 60 per cent for some other refined products containing cocoa.”The impact of such charges goes well beyond lost export opportunities. They suppress technological innovation and industrial development among African countries. The practice denies the continent the ability to acquire, adopt and diffuse technologies used in food processing. It explains to some extent the low level of investment in Africa’s food processing enterprises." False link

That’s why a delegation flew over to Wales last week in pursuit of saving their language. “Without the language, we’re lost,” said Maatalii Okalik, president  of Canada’s National Inuit Youth Council, who was a participant.  Nunavut students never told not to speak Inuktitut, investigation finds No English at home: Nunavut parents go to great lengths to teach children Inuktitut Members of a national Inuit advocacy organization, Inuit Tapiriit  Kanatami, were invited by the Prince of Wales himself after hearing of  their efforts to revitalize Inuktitut by creating a unified writing method for Inuit across Canada’s Eastern Arctic. Teaching in Inuktitut  It’s mandatory for schools in Wales to teach in Welsh from preschool to grade 10. “The language is strong. It’s taught in subjects across the board.  It’s not just a subject,” said Peter Geikie, who works for Inuit  Tapiriit Kanatami. He said he was was impressed by the years of work  that Wales put in to revitalizing their traditional language. On the other hand, Inuit schools require lessons be taught in  Inuktitut until grade three, but it is taught as a subject, similar to  core French or Spanish classes, starting in grade four. Monica Ittusardjuat, the national Inuit language coordinator for  Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, says that the language policies adopted by the  Welsh could serve as a model — and it’s now up to the Inuit to learn  from other cultures and apply it for their children. “They can pass it on to the next generation,” she said. “We have to make it fun and interesting for them.”   " False link

Now she and her daughter hold weekly Wukchumni language classes, and she’s recording an audio version of the dictionary with her grandson. The video and accompanying high school lesson plan seem like a decent introduction to language revitalization, although I’d add a small preemptive caution: I’ve heard from people involved in language revitalization that many aren’t too fond of death metaphors like “dying”, “disappearing”, “extinct”, “saving”, and so on. Words like “endangered”, “struggling”, “precarious”, “sleeping”, and “revitalizing” emphasize the agency of the communities involved, even in the case where a language is brought back into speech from writings and recordings.   Reblogging again because stuff like this is so important. Please watch the video–it’s so amazing and heart felt.  This is amazing.  Yep, talking about a language in terms of “dying” or “disappering” isnt helpful and creates a false sense of inevitability, which is the last thing u need for successful revitalization. Also it fucking hurts those who speak it because that language is alive in them right now - Not Dead. " False link

He said that Turkey currently hosts 3 million refugees and that if they were to march to Europe, the EU would not know what to do with them. In an interview with the Qatar-based Al Jazeera TV, Erdoğan said the 3 million refugees in Turkey could march to Europe, without explaining how they might do that. In a progress report released earlier this week, the EU severely criticized Turkey for backsliding in democracy but praised its efforts to contain refugees inside the country. Criticizing Europe for not accepting even 100 or 500 refugees, Erdoğan brought to mind the EU’s promise to give Turkey 3 billion euros in June in addition to another 3 billion. “As far as I can remember, until now the EU has only given Turkey 250-300 million euros,” Erdoğan said. The EU has been criticized for not taking any concrete action against Turkey despite growing despotism in the country for the sake of a refugee deal that was agreed earlier this year.

On this side of the world things are much simpler: English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and a few Dutch speakers make communication generally much smoother across the continent, along with a few New World Patois thrown into the mix for good measure. At least so the thinking goes. In reality, the American continent is a place of vast linguistic diversity, with more language families found solely in Mexico than in the entirety of the European continent. And with each language comes a particular vision of the world, an inimitable expressivity, a treasure trove of wisdom accrued over the centuries and codified in words and idioms. Yet these languages struggle desperately for survival in the midst of a post-colonial landscape dominated by a small handful of European languages. Consciously or unconsciously, indigenous tongues are often viewed as backward and those who speak them stigmatized, relegated to the margins of official society for refusing to adapt to rules set by colonizers through violence and subjugation.
