Seeing as we are getting new followers each and every day, we thought it would be a good idea to remind everyone about prompts.We take prompts here; little ideas that fill your brilliant minds but for some reason, you decide it would be better if someone else wrote it. We think it’s wonderful we have so many because that means that there is an endless amount of creativity being shared from readers to writers. However, as we get more and more followers, more and more prompts come in and we end up deleting some which make people sad.The only reasons we would delete prompts are as follows;1. They contain slurs/derogatory terms: I really don’t want to have to explain this one, but surprisingly enough, we will receive prompts that contain slurs/derogatory terms and we refuse to publish them. If you’re not sure whether or not a word is a slur (it probably is if you have to think about it), just send us an ask off anon so that we can help you word it appropriately.2. They are too vague: saying you want some phan angst just isn’t enough…neither is phan angst where they fight. A proper prompt would say something like ‘Phan angst where Dan and Phil are getting annoyed at each other’s little quirks (Dan dropping papers behind tables, Phil leaving cabinets open, etc.) but they keep letting the little things slide. However, one of them reaches a tipping point and starts listing off all the things the other does wrong. They fight and say things they don’t mean, but after some time, decide to apologize and make up.’ You want to be a little bit specific so that the authors have something to go off of. Help them out and they are more likely to publish the fic you want to read!3. They are repeats: I know you’re eager to see your prompt be published, but please be patient! While all the admins work hard to keep the ask box under control, we still have work, school, family obligations, social lives, etc. that we need to tend to. Please keep in mind that we are people too and we get busy just like you so it might take some time before you see your prompt published.4. They are obvious crack!fics: we love joking around as much as the next person, but when we have an ask box full of well-intentioned prompts, it’s not fair to the people waiting to have to read “lolzor, dan n fil shove a whole fukin cake tin up their bums 4 sexii times~”. It takes time for us to read them when we could have spent that time reading and tagging another ask or prompt. Again, we have lots of stuff outside phanfic and when we have to waste time with silly prompts like that, prompts that many people would like to see published end up getting buried." True text

His pen squeaks across the pale blue paint, already tainted with curse words and penis drawings and tipp-ex and “Call _____ for a good time ;)”. He supposes the caretakers have given up with trying to cover up the graffiti – there are still thin layers of paint and chipped plaster coating every inch of the stall walls, at least showing attempted coverage, but people had just written over them, scribbles of song lyrics and “never got caught” tattooing every inch of the previously blank walls. No amount of assemblies or threats of “whoever did this-“, inserts picture of something someone had written about the Maths teacher on the hall projector, “is seriously going to pay” from the head teacher had ever stopped anyone, so, really, what does Dan have to lose? Sure, they could trace the phone number, but that doesn’t prove anything – he could just as easily throw on the ‘innocent’ act and say it was his friend.  07843983276, he writes. He doesn’t sign it off with any comment, nor kisses, not even a smiley face let alone a winking one.

To claim my first fic, I would write, “philslesters, 1st claim”. To claim a second, I would write, “philslesters, 2nd claim”.Similarly, you can only claim the amount of fics you signed up for. If you have signed up to beta one fic, you can only claim one fic. If you have signed up for two, you can claim two and no more.You must reply to the relevant summary. Right click on the box with the bold red number and select the “insert comment” option from the drop down list.

Anyone making their first claim can overwrite the claims of anyone on their 2nd+ claim. For example, if I were to comment on a summary with “philslesters claim 2” and Michelle commented on it saying “thatsmistertoyou claim 1”, then Michelle would get the fic.
