The DNC systematically fucked over Bernie Sanders and in the process alienated an untold number of Democrat voters, then turned around and basically told them to suck it up, and that this is how the game is played. They then enabled the nomination of Clinton who, while eminently qualified to be president, was a deeply flawed and fatally uninspiring candidate. Whether or not you think the “scandals” of Benghazi and her private email server were disqualifying events doesn’t really matter; they were more than enough to compromise her to a large percentage of the American electorate. The signs were there all along, we just chose to whistle past the graveyard.And as for Trump, I’ll say this for today. I along with a great many people underestimated the sheer scope of anger and resentment that fueled his victory. It’s clear that many millions of people feel, for whatever reason, that they have been ignored by the political establishment. But what kills me is that most of the people supporting him either don’t realize or don’t care about a pretty crucial fact: Donald Trump doesn’t give a shit about them and never did. He is the ultimate user, and all those people waiting for manufacturing or fossil fuel jobs to come back, or for minorities to be silenced and go away, are in for a rude awakening. Because at all times Trump will do what’s best for him and him alone.Lastly, I totally understand the need for a little wallowing and self-pity right now. But let’s not spend too much time on that. All this result says to me is that we need to redouble our efforts to do better by our fellow Americans, ALL of our fellow Americans, and to avoid the temptation to devolve into the bitterness, ignorance and hate that has apparently consumed far too many people already."

Human beings like stories.  When we’re confronted with mysteries, we naturally try to find patterns that fit into a narrative.   If you’re already listening to podcasts or audiobooks and you want to switch things up a little, you might consider diving into the decades of old radio shows that are available for free on the internet. Many of these old radio series were saved in their entirety, with full collections of all existing episodes. Archive.org has an excellent collection of old radio shows.  So many of those shows have fallen into public domain and are freely available. There are some sellers who charge you a lot of money for CDs of shows that are available for free download or streaming.  Save some money and check archive.org first. This is a great place to explore radio’s golden age – from the 1930s into the 1960s.  There are thousands of high-quality recordings of network dramas, comedies, newscasts and other special programs.   How good are they?  Let’s keep in mind that we’re talking about 50-to 80-year-old shows here. Some are corny and dated (especially the comedies), but so many others hold up well for modern audiences.  Consider trying gritty, dark Gunsmoke and fast-paced Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar for drama.   There’s also an pioneering 1950s program called Night Watch, which was the first to follow police on actual cases, recording some very adult content – from suicides to peeping to a kid playing with explosives.  It’s also interesting to hear the accents and speaking styles of real people from that era. My favorite radio comedy is Vic and Sade, which is a timelessly absurd, dry take on everyday American life.  The brilliant creator and writer, Paul Rhymer, gives us a bizarre world in little 10-minute episodes that will have you wondering at first if you’re missing something – but you soon realize that it’s all right there.   From beef punkles to the everlasting washrag sale at Yamilton’s to the demented uncle who wants to give the family a 400-pound piece of railroad as a doorstop – you’ll fall in love with the show, and you’ll cry when you realize how few episodes exist.  We have recordings of more than 300 episodes, but more than 3,000 others are lost forever. If you like good satire, listen to Bob & Ray. I’m not sure where modern comedy, especially satire, would be without Bob & Ray. I think the sitcoms of the era are a little tougher for modern audiences to enjoy.  Jack Benny and Burns & Allen are very funny, but you’ll run into some topical references that are dated and confusing.   Check out some old-time radio for a lot of free, high-quality entertainment on the go.  Co-sign all of this. I enjoy the hell out of Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar. In addition to all the broadcasts on archive.org, there are a bunch on YouTube and on various iPhone apps. And for those with a SiriusXM subscription, Radio Classics is essential listening." False text

This mainly applies to lovers of vintage images and graphics on Tumblr like me, but I suppose it could be for anyone else in these parts. If you just want me to make with the old ads and whatnot, I guess you can skip this. Hey there! I suppose there’s no way to put any of this without sounding like a scold, so I’ll just say it. It seems some of the other vintage blogs here on Tumblr don’t know how to play nice with the others in the sandbox. What do I mean? Well specifically, there seems to be this aversion on the part of some to sharing credit and sources. I’ll be the first to admit that I’m a lazy puke and I run my Tumblr in my spare time, when I’m not working at my job, raising my family, or working on my other internet endeavors. So I can get sloppy when it comes to properly crediting the sources of the many fun vintage photos and graphics I share. This isn’t done out of malice, and I know I can be better at providing sources or credits. But far too many people on here, some of whom are quite popular, seem to either not know or not care that consistently posting images with none of this information is, quite frankly, a dick move. (The one exception I make is if I find something on eBay or another auction site. I don’t typically link to individual auction listings, since by the time it gets published from my queue the auction has expired. If that makes me a hypocrite, so be it.) The bottom line is this: We, as vintage bloggers, are not the creators of these images. We didn’t snap all those great Marilyn Monroe photographs, nor did we draw all those cool ads that appeared in Life magazine. So please, let’s observe a few rules of common Tumblr decency: If you find something on another Tumblr user’s blog, REBLOG IT AND LEAVE THE ATTRIBUTION IN. This really shouldn’t even be up for debate. If claiming credit is really so important to you that you’re willing to remove this information or simply download and post something as your own, you really need to assess your priorities in life. If hoarding information so you can score all those sweet Tumblr notes for yourself is that important to you, I feel sad for you. If you get something from a website, use that little icon in the upper-right corner of the post and put that URL as the source. I personally allow for the exception listed above, but that’s about it. And don’t bother trying to use a lame excuse like, “that site didn’t really create the content, so they’re not the source.” That’s some bullshit right there. If you downloaded something from a site to post it, that’s your source. This goes double for images you find on Flickr. Flickr makes it really easy to share images, unless a user has disabled that option. Do the right thing and click that Tumblr share icon, and leave the credit in. If providing a URL isn’t practical for whatever reason (like if it’s one of those weird Google Books ones for their magazine archives), then at the very least provide the name of the magazine and the date of publication. Deliberately leaving this info out is a douche move, and believe me I’ve seen people do it time and time again. If you’re posting a photograph, credit the photographer. For pictures of Marilyn and other celebrities, this is almost always known. At least try to find it. I think that’s it, but feel free to add your own. So what’s the big deal about attribution anyway? Well for one thing, it’s just common decency. But for another, it’s an acknowledgment that there is actually another person responsible for either creating the work in question or in putting it on the internet so that you could share it to begin with. (I personally know at least a few people who dedicate countless hours to scanning things, and it hurts a little bit to see them so shamelessly ripped off.) Sharing credit is good for a few reasons. For one, it helps let your followers know where you get your images so they can look into those other sources and maybe find new sites, photographers, or designers they like. I know I’ve personally found lots of cool Tumblrs and other sites because of reblogs and proper credit being shared.  And for another, it just feels good to have your efforts acknowledged in some small way. Very few of us do this Tumblr thing for profit. We do it because we all love old stuff and want to share it with as many others as we can, and quite frankly it does feel good to see others responding to that. I’ve gained a ton of new followers over the last few years, and it does provide just a little extra motivation to keep going at it. OK, I’ve said my piece on this matter, and hopefully if enough people share this we can all get back to wasting way too much time here. Thanks for listening! P.S. - OK, one more thing. I have personally always found Audrey Hepburn to be overrated. There, I said it." True text

I’d love to be able to cluck my tongue and say how above all of this I am. About how I pay absolutely no attention to meaningless stats like followers, likes, or reblogs. But that’s just not true. I do pay attention. The difference for me, I suppose, is that I view it more as a game than as a quest for validation. I love it when something I post goes viral. I’m still at the point where 100 notes is still a lot for me. However, the time spent putting my posts together here is pretty minimal compared to my main web endeavor. (Visit today, it’s free!) Some time ago I came to the conclusion that I will never be super-popular on the interwebs. I possess neither the laser focus, built-in celebrity or abundance of free time needed to really make it big. Whatever that even means.  This year I made the decision to disable stats reporting on my blog, and I can tell you that it’s been an incredibly liberating experience. I am now truly free to share what I want when I want, in a way I don’t think I was when I was always keeping one eye on those damn bar graphs. The result is less content on my main site, but better quality when I do publish. And it also means I can take my sweet time and really use my site as it was originally intended - an expression of my passion and interests.  My current BIG project is a collection of sports programs from all the major North American leagues, going back to the 1920s and earlier. This thing will likely get a few dozen hits a day if that. But that’s OK, because I’m having a ton of fun putting it all together and I don’t need statistics to validate that. — tl;dr - Unless you’re depending on hit counts or notes to keep you employed, worrying about them is a fool’s game. Just create and share what you love and the rest will take care of itself." False link
