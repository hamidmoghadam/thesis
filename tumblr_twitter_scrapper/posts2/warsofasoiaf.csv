warsofasoiaf 162608412691 "2017-07-04 23:44:04 GMT" http://warsofasoiaf.tumblr.com/post/162608412691/highlights-from-con-of-thrones "I posted a bit about @conofthrones, but here’s all my fun observations of the weekend.My first panel was a discussion the secondary characters who are not the protagonists in their own narratives, along with the fantastic @joannalannister and @poorquentyn. We discussed Aegon, Quentyn, Arianne, Margaery, and Stannis, all characters of protagonist quality with secondary character status, how the traditional fantasy tropes are played and played with in their stories, and the inherent tragedy of being a secondary character in the story, never given the chance to save the world.My second panel was a discussion of Valyrian steel along with Ashaya from History of Westeros AKA @cruzmylene and @axechucker. There we had a brief trivia contest of the three non-cruciform sword types of Valyrian weapons we have evidence for, speculation on what it takes to make Valyrian steel, and thoughts on our favorite lesser-known swords and which ones might make it into the narrative. I personally discussed the possible shape of Euron’s scale armor, and what types of other weapons you could make out of Valyrian steel to maximize the effectiveness of the fantasy metal.Third panel was one of my favorites, an in-depth discussion of war in A Song of Ice and Fire along with Aziz of @historyofwesteros. I discussed why the Children of the Forest’s focus on archery made sense, the military applications of weirwood.net, and then got into the different wars of men. An audience member made a fantastic observation on the War for the Dawn 2.0 as the Bronze Age collapse.Fourth panel was incredibly fun. @poorquentyn, Brad from Watchers, and I discussed grimdark and what it means. The bleakness of the setting is meant to amplify the goodness of the characters, best emphasized with Sansa and Brienne. A grimdark book would never have Brienne bury Nimble Dick Crabb and pay him what he was owed, both in coin and in an apology. We also discussed early grimdark as a reaction to shortcomings in literature, which includes GRRM discussing the shortcomings of Tolkien as well as cyberpunk taking transhumanism to tack about technology solving our problems and the later post-cyberpunk movement as a later reaction to the staleness of the grimdark genre. I also got to use the line as to what I appreciate about 40K lore by the great Dan Abnett: “In the grim darkness of the far future there is more than war. There are real people there too” to show that bleakness is a great literary tool, but needs to be handled appropriately.Fifth panel was on whether Robb should have had a POV, along with Rawrist of YouTube and Bex from Watchers on the Wall. We discussed possible redundancies and advantages, how many chapters it should have had, and my idea for an Olyvar Frey POV. Sixth and final panel was all things Dunk and Egg with both Aziz and Ashaya. We discussed what we loved about each book, and spent a healthy amount of time talking about the new books and what they might entail. Ashaya is excited for the intrigues of Winterfell, and I talked about Lyonel Baratheon calling out Dunk and finally dropping the fact that our great Dunk the Lunk was never knighted. Aziz also explained our possible descendants of Dunk to include Hodor, Small Paul, and everyone’s favorite giant knight: Brienne.Other observations include:@joannalannister was my conbuddy, and using a Lannister sword, I gave her a brief sword lesson and why a bastard sword is a great weapon for a female character.@poorquentyn obviously likes to talk horror, and he had two panels, one was a solo panel, Euron-specific and the other was Lovecraftian leanings in the series with Aziz.@axechucker invited me along with other panelists to dinner with Katie Dickie, and she is most wonderful and has a fabulous Scottish accent. She gave me a little lesson on how to properly speak a few Scottish words and we discussed how much fun her performance as Lysa was, and at the con, she had two panels where she spoke much about breasts. I also got to meet Aimee Richardson and Kerry Ingram, and the two are positively delightful gals. Both Aimee and Katie loved my idea of a “Women of Espionage” show which would tell true stories about women during the Cold War within the various spy agencies, focusing less on honeypots and other traditional Femme Fatale Spy tropes and more upon case agents and simple tradecraft and the incredible intelligence value that they gave their countries.I got to lay out how Stannis would beat Renly, and I built a full battle map using empty drink glasses.I had enough frequent flyer miles that I got a free upgrade to Business Class. So that was ritzy.Overall, it was a lot of fun. I’m glad I went.-SLAL" True text

So let’s put on our worldbuilding hats and see what we can come up with.Card games have an appeal across classes, as they occupy a middle  ground which is less cerebral with a lower difficulty curve than board  games like chess and cyvasse, but are less fortune-based and more skill-based than dice games. And games form a key part of culture and stories, hence why the wandering gambler or the chess-playing strategist are both key tropes in storytelling.When it comes to designing a game, the key things in a card game is information asymmetry. That’s why in a two player game, usually there is a deck or pool of cards that are undealt so as to not give the players perfect information. Other things to think of are how many players, who deals, the sequence of play, and how you win. One thing that’s important is to include gambling and drinking, as these were an integral part of the history of card gamesSimple pub games would include variants of Old Maid, played with a full deck, one card removed, matching swords and clubs with cups and coins. The loser having to buy a round for the other players. You could see variants and names cropping up referencing bad rulers throughout history, a lone king of swords might be the sole unpaired card and that would be “drawing Maegor,” a lone queen of clubs might be “drawing Rhaenyra” whereas other regions might have a reference to an unpopular historical king as the odd man out. The Reach would probably have the 10 of cups as a reference to the weak Garth Graybeard, the Westerlands would call their game “Norwin’s Curse” and have the King of Coins as a satirical reference to Norwin Lannister, the joke being that the stingy King Norwin has to buy the rest of the players a round. Others include “Stranger’s Seven,” a variant of Crazy Eights where sevens become the wild card. Scoring variants of Stranger’s Seven would be as normal, and the pub variant would be that the winner gets a drink from the person with the most points. These games have the advantage of being incredibly easy to learn, thus players could leave and enter the game relatively quickly, and there would never be a shortage of people in the tavern to play.More complex games might involve matching games similar to Rummy, with sequence melds called “families” and match melds called “books.” The idea would largely be to go out of cards. Melding all cards would be given a suitable term, “Queen Aly’s Luck” or “Brandon’s Blessing” just as examples. Just like in Rummy, doing so would add score to the other players, but be hard to do.I could see cribbage variants being named after the various wars throughout history, especially with Blackfyre variants, with one player being ‘red’ or ‘Daeron’ and the other being ‘black’ or ‘Daemon.’ These games would have their variants suppressed shortly after the war, but they would still be played, or cited.  Gambling games would probably be closer to poker rather than baccarat or blackjack, because those types of games require a house dealer and we don’t really see casinos. Those would be comparison type games, with infinitely complex variations and bluffing. I could see the game being highly-prized in Dorne for their culture of military deception, but good bluffers would also be highly-prized in the Stormlands where their low numbers mean that shows of strength are important against the populous Reach. This, of course, would lead to a popular and possibly apocryphal story about a Dornish and Stormlander gambler, bonding over their hand, both spectacular bluffers who both had the lowest possible hands, to inevitably end in either comedy, when a border dispute turns out to both be amazing bluffs, or tragedy when neither recognize each other on the battlefield after seven years because both finally outbluffed the other.I could see even more complex games being played among the nobility, who have the time to learn opaque rules. Trick-taking games like contract bridge would probably be viewed under the context of a war, with partners being allied houses fighting for control of a disputed territory. For example, in the Riverlands, this game might be called “The Teats” while in other territories, it’s named after useful borderlands. In Dorne, for example, one team might be Salt and the other Stone (Sand would probably be avoided as that it is a bastard name) and the game called “The Wells.” I would imagine even a superstition around the game, if the first time two betrothed pairs play as partners and do well, their marriage would be considered particularly auspicious or lucky, conversely, if the two cannot play in sync, the marriage may be cursed with infighting.I would definitely think regional cards would probably have the highest symbol be the lord of the land. Westeros might call their red fool card a “Florian” and their black fool a “Mushroom,” and I would imagine that both cards would be, much like the Joker in our own world, wild cards, as Florian was as mighty as any knight or king when it came to his beloved Jonquil. In Dorne, following Aegon’s Conquest, the Fools would be Toland’s mad fool, and the other being Aegon I himself. Before the Conquest, I’d imagine the highest suit would be stylized after the sigil of the ruling king, with artwork stylized after depictions of famous figures. After the Conquest, the dragons would become the new highet sigil, with new decks of cards symbolizing moments in history. For example, when Aemma Arryn and Viserys I Targaryen were wed, I’d imagine the Queen of Dragons would have falcon motifs and resemble her, even though she’s a dragon-suited card. Bloodraven would burn any deck of cards that had a depiction of Daemon, whether as a king of dragons (seditious) or a knight of dragons, and would encourage cards depicting Baelor Breakspear as the knight of dragons with Daeron as the King (and perhaps himself as Knave). Given that not all decks were standardized until far later in our contemporary history, designing a single game would be impossible, but I can see variants of our own real-world games played throughout history.Thanks for the shout, Butterfly, and I hope you like the answer, Dog.SomethingLikeALawyer, Hand of the King" True text

So, I figured it was time to remedy that, with much help from @racefortheironthrone​. North House Ryswell: The Appendices for both AFFC and ADWD list Roger, Rickard, and Roose Ryswell as Lord Rodrik’s “quarrelsome cousins and bannermen” (though Theon in ADWD notes that Roger, Rickard, and Roose are Rodrik’s sons) House Manderly: Wyman Manderly tells Davos in ADWD that his “bannermen include a dozen petty lords and a hundred landed knights” Ramsgate and the Sheepshead Hills are definitely sworn to White Harbor, according to the app, but it’s unknown which families control them (though the Woolfields controlling one is a strong possibility, given the name of the family and the fact that a Woolfield is married to the current Manderly heir). It’s possible that the Lockes of Oldcastle and the Flints of Widow’s Watch are sworn to the Manderlys, as Wyman alleges he can deliver “all the lands east of the White Knife, from Widow’s Watch and Ramsgate to the Sheepshead Hills and the headwaters of the Broken Branch”.  However, in all relevant appendices the Lockes and this branch of House Flint are listed as primary bannermen of Winterfell, rather than bannermen of the Manderlys; Wyman’s words may only be suggesting his ability to influence his lordly neighbors, rather than a true liege-vassal relationship.  House Reed:  House Blackmyre (“Reek II”, ADWD) House Boggs (“Reek II”, ADWD) House Cray (“Reek II”, ADWD) House Fenn (“Reek II”, ADWD) House Greengood (“Reek II”, ADWD) House Peat (“Reek II”, ADWD) House Quagg (“Reek II”, ADWD) House Glover:  House Bole (“The King’s Prize”, ADWD) House Branch (“The King’s Prize”, ADWD) House Forrester (“The King’s Prize”, ADWD) House Woods (“The King’s Prize”, ADWD) Vale House Royce:  House Coldwater (AFFC Appendix) House Tollett (AFFC Appendix) House Shett of Gulltower (AFFC Appendix) House Corbray: in “Alayne II”, AFFC, Sansa thinks that “Corbray’s vassals” would be attending the wedding of Lord Lyonel and his Gulltown bride House Waynwood:  House Hardyng (“Alayne II”, AFFC)House Sunderland:  House Borrell (AFFC Appendix) House Longthorpe (AFFC Appendix) House Torrent (AFFC Appendix) Riverlands House Vance of Wayfarer’s Rest:  House Smallwood (“Arya IV”, ASOS)House Frey House Erenford (“Jaime VI”, AFFC) House Haigh (“Jaime VI”, AFFC) House Charlton (“Jaime VI”, AFFC) Harrenhal (presumably applicable for the duration of Harrenhal’s feudal holding) House Wode (“Jaime III”, AFFC) House Whent (formerly) (“The Riverlands: House Tully”, TWOIAF) Westerlands House Reyne: TWOIAF notes that “Lord Reyne reportedly laughed when his maester read him Ser Tywin’s edicts and counseled his friends and vassals to do nothing”. House Tarbeck: TWOIAF notes that “[t]he Lannister host descended so quickly that Lord Walderan’s vassals and supporters had no time to gather”. House Farman House Clifton (“Jaime VIII”, AFFC)Reach House Rowan House Osgrey (“The Sworn Sword”) House Webber (“The Sworn Sword”) House Tarly House Hunt (AFFC Appendix)House Hightower House Beesbury (AFFC Appendix) House Mullendore (AFFC Appendix) House Costayne (AFFC Appendix) House Bulwer (AFFC Appendix) House Cuy (AFFC Appendix) House Redwyne  House Rhysling: speculative. “Rhysling” sounds not unlike “riesling”, which might be a clue that the Rhyslings are in the winemaking business - and the only spot for real winemaking in the Reach is the Arbor.  House Cupps: speculative. Again, the name suggests a connection to the wine-drinking Arbor, and House Cupps being a vassal of the wealthy and powerful Redwynes might explain why the very powerful Leyton Hightower would allow his daughter Leyla to wed Ser Jon Cupps (especially as Leyla’s sister Denyse wed Ser Desmond Redwyne) Dorne House Yronwood  House Drinkwater: possibly if not probably. The app says that Gerris Drinkwater is a “knight sworn to Yronwood”, though this porbably only refers to Gerris being a household knight at Yronwood, as Gerris does not seem to be the head of House Drinkwater (since his twin sisters are called daughters, rather than sisters, of a landed knight). The House is not formally noted as a vassal of Yronwood in any Appendix, and only designated as a landed knightly House in the text, but in “The Spurned Suitor” Quentyn Martell thinks that he wants to “go back to Yronwood and kiss both of [Gerris Drinkwater’s] sisters”. This may suggest that the Drinkwater twins live on or near the Yronwood holdings, which would be sensible for daughters of an Yronwood bannerman.   House Jordayne (formerly) (“Ancient History: Ten Thousand Ships”, TWOIAF) House Wyl (formerly) (“Ancient History: Ten Thousand Ships”, TWOIAF) It’s possible that the Blackmonts and Qorgyles were also at one time Yronwood bannermen; Yandel writes that Nymeria and Mors Martell “struggled against Yronwood and his bannermen (the Jordaynes of the Tor, the Wyls of the Stone Way, together with the Blackmonts, the Qorgyles, and many more)”.

My mind went back to that man at Paris in 1919. He was a vigorous man then, splendidly made up in his fine dress uniform, medals and boots gleaming in the winter sun. He had been solid then, carved out of stone, vigorous and active when he spoke diplomats and generals alike. In those days his demeanor and bearing was severe without being aggressive; he was a man whose patience showed in his words but not his expression. He was a man of action who was out of his depth at a high table, yet who stubbornly refused to deliver anything less than the highest conduct in the tradition of his ancient nation.The man I looked upon now was at least ten kilos lighter, perhaps even fifteen. Makeup had attempted to hide the blackness under his eyes and the furrow in his brow, but it was as a pile of sand holding back the ocean. His skin sagged, and his knuckles were clenched white at all times, as if in silent protest. His expression was subdued, almost empty, yet behind his eyes there was a light of something, a barely burning candle. The Bull of Byzantium’s fire seemed only able to muster this half-a-man, this wispy specter who wore the mantle of an emperor. Seventeen years ago, he was a man who spoke and felt like one who could take on the world and win, yet now he was so very small, invisible save for the deference that others gave him. The purple had done what the Turks and the Germans together could not…grind this noble man down as a waterfall pounds the stones smooth. He that had stood against the hurricane of war with head proud, was now a step above a reed, tied to a stake to stand upright. When once he had been a Colossus, a man half above us mere mortals, now he was a shell, using every fibre of his being, simply to appear as we were. The contrast between that man and this one, was devastating.”" True text

I have a new essay today, all about Prince Doran Martell! Far from being one of the smartest players in the game of thrones, Doran, in my opinion, is one of the worst strategists in the series who has categorically failed to reverse Robert’s Rebellion and restore House Targaryen to the Iron Throne (and House Martell to royal favor). I wanted to use this essay to highlight Doran’s plans and where in each he failed to undertake the logical steps necessary to complete those plans. Doran does not merely pretend to be the grass, soft to walk on but hiding the viper - he is the grass, blown by passionate winds yet unable to stir itself to action. Hope you like! The Queen Regent (NFriel)  Amen! Couldn’t agree more with you throughout <3 Doran’s not a chessmaster, he’s a tragic character whose story is driven by his mistakes and blind spots. Quentyn’s story made this so heartbreakingly clear:  He felt as though he might be sick. What am I doing here? Father, why? Four men dead in as many heartbeats, and for what? “Fire and blood,” he whispered, “blood and fire.” I said the other day that this is such a perfect, powerful deconstruction of the final moments of “The Princess in the Tower.” When Doran whispered “fire and blood,” it seemed like a triumph…but by the time Quentyn repeats it, moments before his unimaginably painful death, we’ve seen how terrible Doran’s plan was, and the doom to which it has confined Quent (hence the Hell imagery throughout the latter’s chapters).   Aww! Tumblr friends liking things! <3 you back!What’s so sad about the whole Quentyn affair, besides everything, is that it is so avoidable. There was everything Doran could have done about Quentyn’s journey, such that no one needed to die. But no. He trusts a son with no demonstrable charisma or political shrewdness, who has only ever known a life of relative ease and privilege, to lead a dynastically unimpressive band on an unclear and wild itinerary across a war-torn region, all in the hope that a dragon-owning woman he does not know, who is a queen in her own right, will comply with the dictates of a decade (or more) old precontract between a dead man and another woman. Failure is literally not an option; there is no Plan B for any of the variants that could have altered the course (i, say, Daenerys had been overthrown in the interim, had died of natural causes, had freaking been married to someone else). Quentyn was doomed from the moment he passed under Yronwood’s portcullis, had he but known it.Completely agree with that quote. Damn! I should have used it. Would have been a nice bookend. Ah, hindsight is water under the bridge, or something.The Queen Regent (NFriel)" False link

Obviously, from the title and the image you might guess that this essay is about House Hornwood and you’d be right! House Hornwood’s inheritance problem was the pressing issue at the harvest feast at Winterfell in A Clash of Kings, and for good reason; as a prime vassal seat of the Starks, controlling valuable natural resources, Hornwood would make a prize for any northern lord. But I think there’s one person, mentioned ever so briefly, that could make a strong claim to Hornwood - so long as a king or two stepped in to help him. In this essay I wanted to show how that young man could go from the Bastard of Hornwood to Lord of the Hornwood, sitting his father’s seat in the trials for the North to come.Special thanks to the Hand and BryndenBFish for editing this one!The Queen Regent (NFriel)" True link

I’ve looked at Tyrek Lannister and Olyvar Frey, and today I wanted to present two candidates for the Bastard of Darry - an illegitimate cousin briefly mentioned in the story who may come back to claim “his” seat in the future. With the Darrys so emphasized as a pro-Targaryen family, I think it’s very possible we could see a Darry resurgence in the reign of the would-be Aegon VI, and either of the scenarios in this essay could serve to aid Aegon in his quest to control the Seven Kingdoms.Thanks for reading!The Queen Regent (NFriel)" True link

This is the next part of the Heirs in the Shadows series, my collaborative essay series with BryndenBFish. Two weeks ago I released Part 1, talking about Tyrek Lannister and a potential Varys plot to name him puppet Lord of Casterly Rock under the would-be Aegon VI. This week’s essay concerns the Rosby Inheritance - a comparatively minor issue discussed in A Feast for Crows, but one I feel will become far more important during The Winds of Winter. I’ve identified someone I think would be both a likely and narratively satisfying claimant to Rosby, one who could assert an old loyalty in the collapse of the Lannister-run regime in King’s Landing.

It seems the Peakes were always on the wrong side of history - those who drove the reader-beloved Manderlys out of the Reach, those who rose with the Black Dragon more than once, those whose rebellion killed King Maekar. The more I looked into it though, the more it became clear that the Peakes, while certainly ambitious, were no worse in most situations than those they were fighting.So here’s a new look at the Peakes - not as a good family, not as secret heroes, but as a family that maybe deserves a little more than simply “villain” status.

Though a comparatively minor character, Tyrek’s mysterious and very thorough disappearance continues to inspire debate over his fate.

It’s one I’ve been meaning to write for a little while, and then just decided “Eh, fuck it, I’ll just sit down and do it.” So I did! “The Rogue Prince” is fascinating to me, because I simply adore ASOIAF history. I like talking about it, I like writing about it, I just like it, And while there are definitely problems with that story (the Hand and I are in agreement that “The Princess and the Queen” actually would have made a better title for that story, since the pretense of focusing on Daemon was dropped like that spooky 90s plush Hot Potato game), I really liked these murder mysteries that are presented. It’s nice to have a way to engage the story, to try to figure something out that is ultimately unknowable (unless GRRM says something different). With Jon Arryn, we got an answer to that eventually; but with poor Laenor and the Strongs, the only answer is the one you as a reader thinks makes the most sense. I tried to present the cases as logically as possible, to come to the best conclusion, but there are no right answers here, and that’s what makes them fun.Enjoy!The Queen Regent (NFriel)" True link

It’s just a really nice, magical time for me.But I also love you guys. Not in a sappy way, but I know that this blog, the Tumblr, the podcasts – none of that would mean much of anything if we didn’t have fans like you all reading, listening, commenting, and generally being awesome. It’s really awesome to be able to engage in the fandom as we do here at Wars and Politics, and I can say that the vast majority of interactions I’ve had with my work on here have been wonderfully positive and enhanced my experience of the series.So I wanted to do something nice for you all – a little Christmas present, as it were (or a present for whatever holiday you celebrate – if nothing else, today is National Eggnog Day). For the past – eh, more time than you want to know – I’ve been transcribing our very first podcast episode, “I Come Not to Praise Rhaegar Targaryen”. If any of you have ever transcribed video or audio, you know how fun it can be, and I am by no means a professional at this. There were moments I could not for the life of me make out what was being said (even from me!), so I made a best guess; for a 90 minute podcast, I think I did a pretty good job. So if you’re hearing-impaired – if you’re a visual rather than an audio learner – if you want to read along like those books-on-tape we used to have in my library, where the book and the tape came in a cute little bag together – any reason at all, you’re welcome to enjoy this transcript.I hope you all have a merry Christmas, and if you celebrate a different holiday, I hope you have a wonderful time as well.

Things are wrapping up at Wars and Politics of Ice and Fire Headquarters (it’s right between the Baxter Building and Fisk Towers) - in fact, I believe this is the last essay for 2015 from all of us. It won’t be the last bit of content, oh no: we have two (!) podcast episodes to release before Earth finishes its lap around the Sun, and a bunch of goodies next week (including a Christmas present from yours truly).Still, it’s Brandon we’re talking about today.   Though Brandon is often remembered for his hot-headedness and typically Stark “wolfsblood”, it is equally important to note just how southron in his training and customs the heir to Winterfell had become by the time he died. His honor was a wolf’s honor – southron in its principle but Northern in its fury – and it was that volatile mix of influences which led Brandon to his death.  On a terribly sentimental note, I’ve adored writing for the blog in the past year, and a huge percentage of the reason I’ve liked it is because of you, the fans. We wouldn’t be a blog-podcast if we didn’t have people reading and commenting and interacting (or we would, but it would be totally lame). You all make it rad, and I’m happy to have found my little spot in this fandom. So thanks for reading my stuff, hope you like it, and stay tuned in 2016!" True link

I’ve really enjoyed it, and I’ve especially enjoyed having such great feedback from the fandom about it, so thank you, you guys.And now for something just terribly sad: Queen Rhaella. There is something just so profoundly sorrowful about her life. It’s as though Rhaella somehow incurred the wrath of Fate, and spends essentially her whole life (at least since around 14) being dogged by cruelty. And yet, Rhaella never did anything wrong. There was no great tragic flaw in Rhaella, something heaven was punishing her for. She simply drew the worst possible lot she could (for her circumstances, at least). Every moment that life goes to give her the smallest bit of comfort, it’s snatched away from her. She endures so much in life, mostly without complaint (and for the one time she is recorded to have complained, I think everyone will agree she had more than a right to). She watches the collapse of everything she’s ever relied on - a stable marriage, a role as royal mother, her kingdom itself - and dies, leaving her young children to the vicissitudes of a fate which had been so cruel to her.Well.

Certainly, there’s much about Viserys that makes him villainous: petty, cruel, ignorant, and vicious, Viserys is remembered as a fool and a poor would-be king not merely by readers but by the characters who knew him. He’s not a good person, and his abuse of Daenerys over years of exile cannot be justified or condoned. Nevertheless: there is a way in which we can understand, I think, the nuanced tragedy which was Viserys’ life that does not excuse the monster he became later. By the age of eight he’s lost his father, mother, brother, and kingdom, and was spirited away, never to see the only home he’d ever known again. After Willem Darry’s gallant if insufficient regency of a few years, Viserys is alone in Essos with his sister; he’s watched but never aided by the men interested in him, and instead finds himself rejected at every turn for help to regain a crown to which he was only lately taught he was the rightful heir. His end is tragically pathetic; he’s given a moment to think he’s gained everything he ever fought for, only to be fatally disillusioned, and the last thing he sees is Daenerys, his only family left, making no move to stop her husband giving him his “rightful” crown.The Queen Regent (NFriel)" True link
