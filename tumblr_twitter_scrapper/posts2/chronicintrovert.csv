Titled “Don’t Cash Crop My Cornrows,” it’s a romping Internet mash-up in which Stenberg delivers a thesis worthy of an American-studies dissertation in four and a half minutes flat: The adoption of the hairstyle by non-black pop stars such as Christina Aguilera and Katy Perry is part of a larger appropriation of black culture that divorces its aesthetics from the struggle that produced them. Narrating on-camera with the confidence of a trial lawyer, Stenberg closes her case with a pointed question: “What would America be like if we loved black people as much as we love black culture?” Read the full piece here More posts on the consistently awesome Amandla Stenberg Niobe: She Is Life by Amandla Steberg and Sebastian A.

Horses could choose between a “no change” symbol or symbols for “blanket on” or “blanket off.” Previously, their owners made this decision for them. Horses are adept at learning and following signals people give them, and it took these equines an average of 10 days to learn to approach and touch the board and to understand the meaning of the symbols. All 23 horses learned the entire task within 14 days. They were then tested in various weather conditions to see whether they could use the board to tell their trainers about their blanket preferences. The scientists report online in Applied Animal Behaviour Science that the horses did not touch the symbols randomly, but made their choices based on the weather. If it was wet, cold, and windy, they touched the “blanket on” icon; horses that were already wearing a blanket nosed the “no change” image. But when the weather was sunny, the animals touched the “blanket off” symbol; those that weren’t blanketed pressed the “no change” icon. The study’s strong results show that the horses understood the consequences of their choices, say the scientists, who hope that other researchers will use their method to ask horses more questions.    i love everything about this but especially the last sentence " False link

Because seriously – there are so many stories lately about cis men playing trans women, and so many people saying that any man who gets cast as a trans woman should turn down the role. SO, let’s talk about Adam Lambert, and how he did that. He was offered the lead role of Frank-n-Furter in the new Rocky Horror production and he turned it down. And then, the showrunners responded by a) casting Laverne Cox instead, and b) giving Lambert a different role in the show anyway. In the end, everybody did the right thing and everybody got something good out of it.  I know Rocky Horror in general is a pretty touchy subject, with people having both extremely positive and extremely negative experiences with it, but let’s still acknowledge that some things are going very, very right in this production.  " False link
