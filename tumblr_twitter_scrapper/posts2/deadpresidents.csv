Crawford had been a front-runner to replace Monroe, but a stroke in 1823 ruined those chances.  Crawford had been serving as Secretary of the Treasury since 1816 when he was appointed by President James Madison and continued on throughout Monroe’s term.  Tired, frustrated, and ready to retire home to Georgia, Crawford called on Monroe at the White House to suggest a list of appointments he wished the President to approve for custom officers at ports in the Northeastern United States, some of the choicest political patronage positions available in the federal government.  However, Monroe objected to Crawford’s list and stated that he intended to name his own picks.  Crawford lost his temper and told the President, “Well, if you will not appoint persons well-qualified for the places, tell me whom you will appoint that I may get rid of their importunities!”.The President – a Revolutionary War veteran of George Washington’s Army who carried a bullet in his body that had nearly killed him in 1776 – was not intimidated by Crawford’s language or temperament, coldly telling his Treasury Secretary, “Sir, that is none of your damn business.”  Crawford was not easily intimidated, either.  The Treasury Secretary had killed a man in a duel years earlier and Monroe’s comment led Crawford to charge at the 67-year-old President with his cane, shaking it at Monroe while calling him a “damned infernal old scoundrel.”  Monroe quickly grabbed two red hot tongs from a nearby fireplace for self-defense and threatened to personally throw Crawford – who was 15 years younger than the President – out of the White House.Both men calmed down as President Monroe prepared to summon his servants to show the Treasury Secretary out.  Crawford apologized for his actions and stated that he did not intend to insult or threaten the President.  Before Monroe could ask him to leave, Crawford left the White House on his own.  The two men never spoke again. The “Era of Good Feelings” was over." True text

You don’t always enjoy all of your coworkers, but you’re far better off finding a way to get along with them than you are harping on the things you don’t like.And being a successful senator is as much about being a good coworker as it is about being smart or well versed in the issues or a talented orator. If you can be a pleasure to work with, you’ll get more accomplished than if you’re a pill whom nobody can stand.Which brings me to Ted Cruz.As I mentioned in the last chapter, there are unwritten rules of the Senate that everyone follows in order to maintain civility and foster productive working relationships. One of those unwritten rules is that you aren’t supposed to repeat in public a conversation you’ve had with a colleague in private if that conversation makes your colleague look bad in any way.I’ve decided to observe that practice in this book, with one exception: Ted Cruz.For what it’s worth, I feel fully justified in doing so, because Ted violated basic Senate protocol himself when he went to the floor and called Mitch McConnell a liar. It was the sort of thing that just isn’t done, a breach of decorum so shocking that even I haven’t committed it. And I love calling people liars!Anyway, here’s the thing you have to understand about Ted Cruz. I like Ted Cruz more than most of my other colleagues like Ted Cruz. And I hate Ted Cruz.The reason I like Ted more than most of my other colleagues do is that he actually has a decent sense of humor. Ted has tried out jokes on me. They’re usually pretty pedestrian – generally, I can see the punch line coming, and many are not-very-good versions of constructions I’ve heard before. But as politician jokes go, they’re not bad at all. And Ted is a fan of comedy. I think. You’re never entirely sure with this guy.One Monday, after a week’s recess, Ted came up to me on the floor to tell me that he and some friends had watched a rerun of my Stuart Smalley sketch with Michael Jordan and raved about how funny it was. I think he was being sincere, which meant it was a genuinely nice gesture.The only problem was that at that moment I was talking to Jeff Sessions about our respective recesses. And now I had to try to explain to Jeff what Ted was talking about. Which meant I had to explain what recovery is, what affirmations are, what public-access TV is, what a parody of public-access TV is – and I had to do it all in about thirty seconds before Jeff lost interest. Which I of course failed to do, and Jeff kind of faded away to talk with someone else. Great.Anyway, Ted has a sense of humor, even if it’s a lame one. And he did pay me a modest compliment, even if it was some Machiavellian ploy in service of his ambition to take over the world.The problem with Ted isn’t that he’s humorless. It isn’t even his truly reprehensible far-right politics. No, the problem with Ted – and the reason so many senators have a problem with Ted – is simply that he is an absolutely toxic co-worker. He’s the guy in your office who snitches to corporate about your March Madness pool and microwaves fish in the office kitchen. He is the Dwight Schrute of the Senate.In a way, he’s a perfect example of what I said…about how it’s not your knowledge of policy or your political talents, but rather your people skills, that determine whether you succeed as a senator.For sure, Ted is extremely smart. Only the most brilliant young lawyers get to clerk for Supreme Court justices, and Ted got to clerk for Chief Justice William Rehnquist. And he’s a truly gifted speaker who can frame an argument brilliantly. From what I’ve heard, when Cruz later returned to the Court to argue cases in his capacity as the solicitor general of Texas, clerks would all make a point to be present in the chamber so they could watch him do his thing.I don’t begrudge Ted that. There are plenty of senators who are smarter than I am, or have more natural political aptitude than I do. For example, my own senior senator, Amy Klobuchar. Or my friend Sheldon Whitehouse, one of the smartest people I’ve ever met. Or Lindsey Graham. But I like them all. Because none of them are sociopaths.”– Senator Al Franken, on fellow Senator Ted Cruz. This excerpt is just the beginning of an entire chapter that Franken writes about Cruz, and the entire chapter is glorious.

But it also means finding a way to fight with every fiber of your being against people you’re friends with.I rarely voted with Jeff [Sessions] when he was a senator. And that’s fine. Senators disagree. But I knew that as attorney general he would represent a clear and present danger to the civil rights of millions of Americans. And his confirmation hearing would be my opportunity to raise that alarm. Which I did, without apology, calling him out for overstating his involvement in civil rights cases and holding his feet to the fire on Donald Trump’s fearmongering about voter fraud (which, of course, is nothing more than a pretext for voter suppression). And then I voted against him.Jeff Sessions is my friend (or was). Franni is friends with his wife, Mary. When our grandson, Joe, was born, Mary knit him a baby-blue blanket, which became his favorite.It’s hard to unfairly demonize someone whose wife knit your grandson his favorite blanket. Which is why when my job meant doing everything in my power to deny my friend this important position, I was relieved that there was so much to fairly demonize him for.”– Senator Al Franken, on his relationship with Jeff Sessions when they served together in the Senate prior to President Trump’s nomination of Sessions to be Attorney General, Al Franken, Giant of the Senate (BOOK | KINDLE)."

Jimmy Carter is right behind Bush, however, and will turn 93 on October 1st.Everyone will always find something to criticize or something to condemn about everybody and anybody, especially when we’re talking about politicians, but politics aside, George H.W. Bush is a decent man. I mean, when he was a child, his nickname was “Have-half” because he was always sharing what he had with anyone else who needed it! But I don’t think it’s fair to look at Bush’s career as a whole without acknowledging that he was a patriot, and pretty much the definition of a public servant. As President Obama said when he awarded Bush the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011, “His life is a testament that public service is a noble calling.” Anyway, here’s something I wrote about Bush.

deadpresidents 161730996662 "2017-06-12 10:29:16 GMT" http://deadpresidents.tumblr.com/post/161730996662/bush-41-war-hero-president-patriarch "The USS Finback, a 312-foot-long Gato-class submarine surfaced a little before noon on September 2, 1944 in the treacherous waters near Chichi Jima, the site of a Japanese military base on one of the Bonin Islands, approximately 150 miles north of Iwo Jima. The Finback was assigned “lifeguard duty” and was performing search and rescue missions for American airmen who had been shot down in action and might have survived via bail-out or crash landing.Earlier that morning, four TBM Avenger aircraft had launched from the USS San Jacinto targeting radio installations on Chichi Jima. At around 8:30 AM, one of the Avengers was blasted by Japanese anti-aircraft shells as it made its bombing run over the island. With the plane on fire and losing control, the pilot continued his run, dropping his four 500-pound bombs on the target he had been given that morning on the San Jacinto. Turning back towards the sea, smoke and flames filled the cockpit, choking the crew of three. Working hard to create distance between the island and the failing aircraft, the pilot ordered his crew to bail out by parachute, shouting “Hit the silk!” over the Avenger’s radio.As the pilot exited the aircraft, his head smashed into the plane’s tail, slicing a thick gash above his eye, tearing panels from his chute, and sending him plummeting towards the sea at a higher rate of speed than he should have been. Still, he splashed down in the Pacific Ocean and another American plane in the vicinity dropped a life raft near him. He was alive. He was alone.On Chichi Jima, four miles to the southwest, Japanese authorities began to organize a search party to capture any downed American pilots who might have survived. Boats were launched to find them. The pilot, stung by a Portuguese man-o-war, vomiting from ingesting sea water, and dazed from the trauma of the attack and the bleeding head wound, still had the presence of mind to begin paddling away from Chichi Jima. Allied forces never captured Chichi Jima during the war, and reports of atrocities ranging from Japanese soldiers summarily beheading Allied prisoners to cannibalism of POWs by Japanese troops led to the post-war execution of five of Chichi Jima’s leading officers, including the commander, Major Sueo Matoba.The current was sweeping the Avenger’s pilot towards Chichi Jima and he desperately paddled against it and out into the open sea. Other members of his aerial squadron opened fire to keep away the Japanese boats heading towards him while another American aircraft radioed the downed pilot’s position to the Finback, which steamed towards him.When the submarine surfaced, it was unclear to the pilot whether he had been rescued or captured. Then five American submariners appeared on the deck. Grainy video footage, now over 70 years old, survives of the Finback’s submariners fishing the gangly, 6'2"" pilot from the sea after his three-hour-long ordeal battling injuries and the Pacific Ocean.Like so many of the soldiers and sailors risking and sacrificing their lives on distant continents and in remote seas, including the men who saved his life on that September 2, 1944, the pilot was very young – just 20 years old.His name was George Herbert Walker Bush.•••Today, George H.W. Bush celebrates his 93rd birthday and is one of the longest-living Presidents in American history. As of today, only two U.S. Presidents have lived longer – Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan, both of whom died at the age of 93 (former President Jimmy Carter will turn 93 this year, as well). On October 11th, Bush will have lived longer than Reagan, and he will break Gerald Ford’s record as the longest-living President in American history on November 25th. He was 17 years old and attending the elite Philips Academy boarding school in Andover, Massachusetts when Pearl Harbor was bombed on December 7, 1941. As Bush and many of his fellow well-to-do classmates prepared to graduate in 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson gave a commencement address urging the patrician prep school grads to go to college first rather than to enlist in the war. Four days after graduating, Bush turned 18 years old and immediately enlisted in the United States Navy.With the influence of his father, Bush could have found himself in any number of safe, stateside jobs in the service. Instead, he became the Navy’s youngest fighter pilot. Even before being shot down over Chichi Jima, Bush had experienced the rough landings of flight training and ravages of war. During training, he totaled a plane during a crash landing. In June 1944, he was forced to ditch his plane – fully-loaded with bombs – in the sea during a mission, escaped the plane just before it exploded, and had to be rescued by the USS Bronson. By the war’s end, Bush had flown 58 combat missions during 1,228 hours of total flight time. There were 14 pilots who originally formed Bush’s VT-51 torpedo bomber flight squadron; when he was discharged from the service in September 1945, only Bush and three other pilots from that squadron survived.Yet, it wasn’t what he saw that haunted George H.W. Bush – indeed, what haunts him still today. It was what he didn’t see as he parachuted out of the burning wreckage of his TBM Avenger on September 2, 1944. Or who he didn’t see.•••As Bush prepared to bomb Chichi Jima that morning, he was joined by two crew members in his TBM Avenger, tailgunner Ted White and radioman John Delaney. At 26, White was a few years older than Bush, but their fathers had been classmates at Yale, which created an obvious connection between the two young men aboard the San Jacinto. White wasn’t a normal member of Bush’s crew but, that morning, requested that he be allowed to replace Bush’s regular tailgunner, Leo Nadeau, and received permission.When their plane was hit, Bush did all he could to order his two crew members to bail out of the plane and assist them in doing so, but the black smoke and flames tearing through the aircraft made it impossible for the pilot to see if White and Delaney had indeed exited the plane. Not only had Bush turned the badly-damaged plane out towards the sea, but he dipped the wings to make it easier for the crew members to pop open their door on the left side of the aircraft and bail out. By doing this, Bush cost himself some precious time and made his own exit from the Avenger more difficult – perhaps the reason he slammed against the tail of the aircraft as he parachuted out.Other American pilots in Bush’s squadron that morning said that they noticed two parachutes deploy from Bush’s Avenger. As Bush plummeted towards the Pacific Ocean, he scanned the sky for the chutes of Delaney and White, but saw neither. As he paddled with one hand in his life raft to get as far away from the coast of Chichi Jima as possible, Bush continued to search the sky and the sea for his crewmates. But it was to no avail. John Delaney and Ted White were never found. If one of the two men did bail out of the plane with Bush and deploy his parachute, he was immediately lost and the same pilots overhead that radioed Bush’s position to the Finback never located him. The other man most likely went down with the crippled TBM Avenger.Nearly 60 years later, when Bush’s son had also been elected President of the United States, Bush visited the Bonin Islands and spoke to CNN about his ordeal. With all of the experiences of his life – all of the triumphs and tragedies – it was the loss of Ted White and John Delaney which continued to weigh heavily on George H.W. Bush. “I wake up at night and think about it sometimes,” the former President told CNN, “Could I have done something differently? I’m not haunted by anything other than the fact I feel a responsibility for the lives of the two people that were killed. I wonder if I could have done something different? I wonder who got out of the plane? I wonder – wonder why the chute didn’t open for the other guy? Why me? Why am I blessed? Why am I still alive? That has plagued me.”How much did it plague George H.W. Bush? When the author and historian James Bradley interviewed the former President about his story for Bradley’s 2003 book Flyboys: A True Story of Courage (BOOK | KINDLE), Bush startled Bradley by asking the author if he had any new information about the fates of John Delaney and Ted White.•••When the Finback surfaced and fished George Herbert Walker Bush out of the sea, the submariners treated him for his wounds, fed him, gave him new clothes to wear, and he became a part of the Finback crew – an honorary submariner – for the next month, as the submarine continued its mission, patrolling hot spots in the Pacific Theater just in case another downed pilot required rescue.Everything was still raw when the future President sat down the next day at a typewriter on the Finback and pecked out a letter to his parents back home in Connecticut. It is the testament of a 20-year-old man born with all of the advantages in the world, sharing his story with his parents and letting them know how the war had touched him…and how it could easily touch them:Dear Mother and Dad,This will be the first letter you have gotten from me in a good long while. I wish I could tell you that as I write this I am feeling well and happy. Physically I am O.K., but I am troubled inside and with good cause. Here is the whole story at least as much of it as I am allowed to relate right now.Yesterday was a day which will long stand in my memory. I was on a bombing hop with Delaney as my radioman and Lt. (j.g.) Ted White as my gunner. He did not usually fly, but I asked him if he would like to go with me and he wanted to. We had the usual joking around in the ready room about having to bail out etc. – at that time it all seemed so friendly and innocent but now it seems awful and sinister.I will have to skip all the details of the attack as they would not pass the censorship, but the fact remains that we got hit. The cockpit filled with smoke and I told the boys in back to get their parachutes on. They didn’t answer at all, but I looked around and couldn’t see Ted in the turret so I assumed he had gone below to get his chute fastened on. I headed the plane out to sea and put on the throttle so as we could get away from the land as much as possible. I am not too clear about the next parts. I told them to bail out, and then I called up the skipper and told him I was bailing out. My crewmen never acknowledged either transmission, and yet the radio gear was working – at least mine was and unless they had been hit back there theirs should have been, as we had talked not long before. I heard the skipper say something but things were happening so fast that I don’t quite remember what it was. I turned the plane up in an attitude so as to take pressure off the back hatch so the boys could get out. After that I straightened up and started to get out myself. At that time I felt certain that they had bailed out. The cockpit was full of smoke and I was choking from it. I glanced at the wings and noticed that they were on fire. I still do not know where we got hit and never will. I am now beginning to think that perhaps some of the fragments may have either killed the two in back, or possibly knocked out their communications.Fortunately I had fastened all my straps before the dive and also I had left my hatch open, something I hadn’t been doing before. Just the day before I had asked the skipper and he advised leaving it open in a dive. The jump itself wasn’t too bad. I stuck my head out first and the old wind really blew me the rest of the way out. I do remember tugging at my radio cord which I had forgotten to unplug. As I left the plane my head struck the tail. I now have a cut head and bruised eye but it is far from serious. After jumping, I must have pulled the ripcord too soon for when I was floating down, I looked up at the canopy and several of the panels were all ripped out. Just as I got floating down, I saw the plane strike the water. In the meantime, I noticed that there was a liferaft down in the water. Not until later did I discover that it was mine that was supposed to be attached to my lifejacket. I had forgotten to hook it on, and when I left the plane it had come loose and had fallen into the water. Fortunately, the wind didn’t carry me too far away from the raft. The entrance into the water was not too bad. I had unloosened several of my chute straps so that when it came to getting out of the harness I wouldn’t have too many buckles to undo under the water. I went fairly deep when I hit, but not deep enough to notice any pressure or anything. I shook the harness and the wind carried the chute away on the water. The wind was blowing towards shore, so I made every effort to head the other way. The skipper saw me and he saw my raft, so he made a pass over it to point it out to me. I had inflated my mae west [sailors called their inflatable yellow life vests “Mae Wests”] and then started swimming towards the raft. Fortunately, the fall hadn’t injured the boat, so it inflated easily and I struggled into it. I then realized that I had overexerted myself swimming, because suddenly I felt quite tired. I was still afraid that the wind would take me in closer so I began paddling. It was a hell of a job to keep the water out of the raft. In fact I never did get it bailed out completely. At first I was scared that perhaps a boat would put out from shore which was very close by, but I guess our planes made them think twice about that. A few fighter planes stayed nearby the whole time until I was rescued and you can imagine how comfortable that was. One of them came right over me and dropped me some medical supplies which were most welcome, since I had no idea how badly cut up I was. It turned out to be slight, but did use the iodine anyway. I had some dye marker attached to my life jacket and also there was some in the raft so I sprinkled a bit of that on the water so the planes could see me easily. I took inventory of my supplies and discovered that I had no water. The water had broken open when the raft fell from the plane I imagine. I had a mirror and some other equipment, and also was wearing my own gun and knife.There was no sign of Del or Ted anywhere around. I looked as I floated down and afterwards kept my eye open from the raft, but to no avail. The fact that our planes didn’t seem to be searching anymore showed me pretty clearly that they had not gotten out. I’m afraid I was pretty much of a sissy about it cause I sat in my raft and sobbed for awhile. It bothers me so very much. I did tell them and when I bailed out I felt that they must have gone, and yet now I feel so terribly responsible for their fate, Oh so much right now. Perhaps as the days go by it will all change and I will be able to look upon it in a different light.I floated around for a couple of hours during which time I was violently sick to my stomach, and then the planes started zooming me, pointing out my position to my rescuers. You can imagine how happy I was when I saw this submarine hove into view. They pulled me out of the raft and took me below where they fixed me up in grand style. As I write this I am aboard the sub – don’t know how long I will be here, or when I will get back to the squadron.As I said physically I am o.k. The food aboard here is unequaled anywhere I have ever seen. I am getting plenty of sleep and am even standing watches so that I will get the air occasionally. My back ached as did my leg last nite, and also my seat was a bit sore from the chute straps, but the pharmacist mate rubbed me down and today I feel much better. Last nite I rolled and tossed. I kept reliving the whole experience. My heart aches for the families of those two boys with me. Delaney had always been a fine loyal crewman. His devotion to duty was at all times highly commendable and his personality most pleasing. I shall most certainly write to his family after I am sure they have been notified by the Bureau.As for Ted White, I have spoken of him several times in my letters before. He was the fellow from Yale, one class ahead of Stu Clement [Bush’s first cousin]. He comes from St. Paul Minn. White Bear Lake to be exact. Perhaps Dad, you know the family. If so do not write them until you get the word from me or elsewhere that the family has been officially notified. There is a possibility that they parachuted and I didn’t see them, but I am afraid it is quite remote as we received a message aboard here last nite saying that only one chute opened. All in all it is terribly discouraging and frankly it bothers me a good deal.As time goes by I shall add bits to this letter and will mail it at my earliest possible convenience. I shall do the same by Bar, but shall not go into detail like this over my experience so please read her the parts of the letter which might interest her. It’s a funny thing how much I thought about Bar during the whole experience. What I wouldn’t give to be with her right now. Just to see that lovely face and those beautiful eyes and to know she was by my side. Right now I long to be with you so much. To be with you both and to be with Bar is my main desire – at least it won’t be too long, the time is going by quite rapidly.Please excuse all my misspellings – they are caused not from ignorance but from carelessness in operating this machine.much much love to you all,your ever devoted and loving son,Pop•••As he celebrates his 93rd birthday, George Herbert Walker Bush has been many things to many people, and has done so much for so many more.During the Vietnam War, Creedence Clearwater Revival’s song “Fortunate Son” sang: “It ain’t me, it ain’t me, I ain’t no Senator’s son/It ain’t me, it ain’t me, I ain’t no fortunate one, no.”Not too long after World War II, George H.W. Bush was a Senator’s son – his father Prescott was elected to the U.S. Senate from Connecticut. Later, George Bush blazed his own trail. Oilman. U.S. Representative from Texas. An unsuccessful candidate for the U.S. Senate from Texas (famously encouraged by the Texas Democrat and President Lyndon B. Johnson that the difference between the House and the Senate was the difference between “chicken shit and chicken salad”). U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. Chairman of the Republican National Committee. Chief U.S. Liaison in China. CIA Director. Vice President of the United States under Ronald Reagan. President of the United States (“41”). Father of one Governor and President (“43”) and another Governor who was once considered a top candidate to become “45″.But before everything – George Herbert Walker Bush was a war hero. And he was a war hero because of his love, honor, and duty to his country.Just don’t ask George Bush if he was a war hero.“It was just part of my duty. People say ‘war hero’. How come a guy who gets his airplane shot down is a hero and a guy who’s good enough that he doesn’t get shot down is not? Ask [John F.] Kennedy about it, why are you a hero? ‘They sank my boat.’ Why am I a hero? They shot down my airplane.”" True text

There were some 30,000 nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal, the rough equivalent, on CIA director calculated, of 55 billion traditional 500-pound TNT bombs from World War II. Enough, as he said, to carpet each state in the union with a billion bombs – and still have five billion bombs left over.From start to finish, the entire process would take under an hour.Even as the nation lay in ruins at the end of that hour, the government would have already carefully considered how the United States itself – how the idea of the United States – would continue forward. During the Cold War, the government secretly invested billions of dollars in a complicated set of plans known as “Continuity of Government” (COG), “Continuity of Operations” (COOP), and its most secretive level, “Enduring Constitutional Government” (ECG). Through these programs, planners gave deep thought to what activities and processes would be needed following a nuclear attack – and even what totems of American culture should be saved. The World War II command bunkers in London eventually inspired a breathtakingly audacious and complex network of dozens of bunkers, ships at sea, scores of helicopters and planes overhead, even secret rail trains, and convoys of tractor-trailers in the United States.Prewritten presidential executive orders sat in office safes across Washington, as did secret draft legislation known as the Defense Resources Act, ready to be filled in Mad Libs-style with dates and emergencies, that laid out an entirely new structure and entirely new roles for how the government would function during a national emergency – effectively suspending the Constitution and Bill of Rights. The presidential Football is well known, but less well known is how the attorney general was accompanied through the darkest days of the Cold War by an “Emergency Briefcase” outlining FBI plans to sweep up thousands of Americans deemed a security threat. Long before Barack Obama made the Washington title “czar” popular, Dwight Eisenhower had imagined an expansive set of secret powers, preselecting nine men – mostly private citizens – who would be real czars, stepping in during an emergency to remake the private sector, seize assets coast to coast, and create new bureaucracies that would control nearly every aspect of American life until peace could be restored.The Post Office would be in charge of registering the nation’s dead; the National Park Service would run the refugee camps; the Department of Agriculture would distribute rationed food. Congress would retreat to a special bunker at a West Virginia resort; the Supreme Court would relocate to another resort in the North Carolina mountains; the Department of the Interior would move to the grounds of a former college in Harpers Ferry. The Federal Reserve kept an underground bunker stocked with a billion dollars cash inside Mount Pony, seventy miles south of Washington. FEMA would help the nation rebuild from regional bunkers in places like Denton, Texas, and Maynard, Massachusetts.It was also carefully decided that at the National Archives, the Declaration of Independence would be saved before the Constitution, and at the National Gallery of Art, Leonardo da Vinci’s Florentine masterpiece Ginevra de’ Benci took priority over Rogier van der Weyden’s Renaissance masterpiece Saint George and the Dragon. The Library of Congress knew it would save the Gettysburg Address ahead of George Washington’s military commission, and in Philadelphia, a specially trained team of park rangers stood ready to evacuate the Liberty Bell into the mountains of Appalachia.At every level, the COG system offered redundancy piled atop redundancy. It was a system that touched every state in the union – and nearly every state hosted a hidden COG facility. The scope of power involved was unlike anything our nation has ever experienced.– Raven Rock: The Story of the U.S. Government’s Secret Plan to Save Itself – While the Rest of Us DieBy Garrett M. GraffSimon & Schuster (BOOK | KINDLE)" True text

When Aaron Sorkin was researching  what would become The American President and The West Wing, Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos pulled out of his wallet what the Hollywood director first thought was a bus pass – it actually was the little card explaining how Stephanopoulos would be evacuated in the event of a nuclear attack. Sorkin incorporated that card into a later West Wing episode, where character Josh Lyman received such a card from the National Security Council and felt guilt because his co-workers wouldn’t also be saved. While shooting the scene, set consultant Dee Dee Myers, the former press secretary to Bill Clinton, pulled Sorkin aside to tell him that the scene was unrealistic because those cards didn’t actually exist. Sorkin was shocked: Even as a top aide, she’d never realized that her co-workers had exactly those cards – and she never did.”Garrett M.

Succession in the House of Saud is always complicated and King Salman had already caused some controversy with a lot of his surviving brothers and the generation of Ibn Saud’s grandsons that are set to begin assuming the throne once Salman dies. Succession isn’t as cut-and-dry in Saudi Arabia as you might think, and this potentially grants a lot of power to one particular branch of the House of Saud for a very long time. Prince Mohammed bin Salman is only in his early-30s, and he’ll be the first grandson of Ibn Saud to become King. Every Saudi King since the death of Ibn Saud, the founder of Saudi Arabia, in 1953 has been one of Ibn Saud’s sons.One other interesting aspect of this is that the now-deposed Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef is highly-respected and has been a favorite of American leaders for several Administrations. The United States saw Mohammed bin Nayef as a comfortable future transition between the generation of Ibn Saud’s sons and the generation of Ibn Saud’s grandsons, and that’s really important because there are hundreds of grandsons and they are all potential successors to the King. King Salman has now deposed two Crown Princes (Prince Muqrin and Prince Mohammed bin Nayef) since he assumed the throne upon the death of King Abdullah in 2015, and it has clearly been done for the benefit of Salman’s son both times."

Prince Philip acts like being a leading patron or active member of nearly 800 organizations is too much work for someone nearing their 100th birthday.Just kidding, I know the Duke of Edinburgh hasn’t been the most politically sensitive member of the British royal family, but I watched a documentary and read a few books about him and was really impressed by how involved he has been – and genuinely devoted to – scores of organizations that have created a lot of opportunities for a lot of people who were traditionally overlooked and underrepresented. He also seems to have more energy than most people who are 1/3rd of his age, including myself, so he’s been doing something right for the past seven decades. By the way, Prince Philip announced that he was lightening his workload when he turned 90 in 2011, but he took part in over 200 events last year, so I’m curious to see what his version of “retirement” might be.(Incidentally – and I’m not sure if this is relevant or not – but unnamed senior sources at Buckingham Palace who agreed to comment on condition of anonymity, told me that Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip have eaten newborn babies for breakfast every day since 1947 and that is the secret to what has made them immortal. The not insignificant levels of vampiric DNA that forms part of the royal couple’s genetic foundation probably plays a role, as well.

So, I’ve finally made the jump and created a Patreon as many, many of my readers have suggested over the past couple of years. I’d like to get back to regularly writing the Original Essays and other projects about Presidential history that probably brought a lot of you to my blog. Honestly, if just half of my followers contributed $1 a month to my Patreon, I’d be able to focus on creating new content for you full-time while also self-publishing the print editions of my book that many readers have asked about. It sounds crazy, but it’s true.  So, if you are able to, please consider contributing to my Patreon. I’m coming up with some good ideas for those who do contribute, including: •Patrons who contribute at least $2 will get a free copy of my 2012 book, Tributes and Trash Talk: What Our Presidents Said About Each Other•Patrons who contribute at least $5 will get the 2012 edition of Tributes and Trash Talk AND the updated edition of the book – which I’m currently finishing (and, yes, it includes the 45th President) – BEFORE the book is officially released to the rest of the public.•Patrons will have access to exclusive content, including brand-new, full-length essays that will be available only to my Patreon contributors exclusively and won’t be published online through any other platform.•Patrons will also have an opportunity to contribute their ideas, suggest topics, and vote on new subjects for me to cover on @deadpresidents. Obviously, I’m not going to stop writing things here on @deadpresidents or stop answering questions if nobody contributes, but if readers are able to contribute just $1 a month to my Patreon I will be able to spend much more time doing those things and creating the content that probably gained your attention in the first place. It would also allow me to finish more in-depth projects like the Presidential Rankings or Vice Presidential Profiles, publish more of the always-popular Historically Accurate Transcriptions, and give me the opportunity to complete other ideas I’ve wanted to work on, including profiles of unsuccessful Presidential nominees and First Ladies. I’m grateful for your support and for motivating me to continue creating content about a subject that I have always loved. I wouldn’t have written about history for the past nine years on Tumblr (!) without if I didn’t have an audience that was willing to listen and that I enjoy sharing my work with. Even if it’s just $1 a month, your contribution to my Patreon will allow me to continue doing some really cool things on @deadpresidents and elsewhere – and contributors will have access to so much more. Thanks to all of you, and if you do want to contribute, you can go here or follow one of the hundreds of other links to Patreon in this post. Thanks again,Anthony  Thanks to everyone who has contributed to my Patreon so far! I’m extremely grateful for the response, as well as for those who reblogged my post. To all of the patrons who have already contributed and reached a level with rewards, I will be in touch soon to make sure I get those to you. If you haven’t contributed yet, I hope you’ll consider it. Even if just half of my Tumblr followers contributed only 50 cents a month to my Patreon, I could focus all of my time and energy into bringing you new content. I’m serious…just fifty cents a month from half of the people who read this would allow me to do that! Plus, once I get to a solid number of monthly contributors I won’t have to keep posting this request. (Believe me, I don’t like asking for contributions any more than you probably like being asked for contributions; it’s not something that I’m totally comfortable with and I’m sure it’s kind of obnoxious but…you know…capitalism and stuff.)  I hate to sound like the Jerry Lewis Telethon, but even contributing just 50 cents a month would give me the opportunity to self-publish the print edition of Tributes and Trash Talk: What Our Presidents Said About Each Other that so many readers have requested since it was originally released, create brand-new content every day, and follow through on bigger projects that I’ve wanted to complete and share with you. And, of course, there will be perks for contributors, including exclusive content that will only be available to my Patreon supporters.
