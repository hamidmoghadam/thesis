I was really looking forward to it, and really wanted to show it to everyone even just a day quicker. More than anything, it shows that ARMYs and us (BTS) are connected as one, so this is all the more meaningful and makes me happy!!😁💕  Trans cr; Alli @ bts-trans© TAKE OUT WITH FULL CREDITS   " True text

Even though it’s been more than 20 years since this song was released (T/N: Referring to Seo Taiji’s original track), I was very surprised that it’s such a refined and polished song; We put in a lot of effort to retain the emotions/sentiments of the original track while also expressing Bangtan’s own colour (in the song). To be honest, as this song belongs to our dae-sunbae (T/N: Literally meaning ‘great senior’, referring to Seo Taiji), we did feel a bit pressured, but we are infinitely honoured to be able to remake this officially.

As for the lyric ‘Getting  my name on the trophy and Come Back Home’, this was the first song we worked on after winning at the Billboard Music Awards so we wrote that while feeling happy. The song was produced on and off during our tour, and we’re thankful that many people listened to it and (thought) well of it!! #ComeBackHome #ComeBackHope 🎶    Trans cr; Alli @ bts-trans© TAKE OUT WITH FULL CREDITS" True text

To be able to meet you?Until the kind spring day that tells us the end of winter	Until the flowers bloom	I want you to stay, just like this	Just like thisYou changed?	If not, then I changed	To bear this passing of time	I guess change happens again	It must be like that for everyone, right?That’s right, this moment in which you left	My feelings that never wavered won’t change	But let’s separate for now	Because that’ll be less painfulYour now cold self is like this sigh, like this sigh	Even though there are so many of these piled up memories leftPetals of snow	They drifted down	And then disappearedI miss youI miss youHow much do I have to wish	How many freezing nights do I have to count	To be able to see you?	To be able to meet you?You know it all	You’re my best friend	Morning will come again	Because all nights and all seasons	Have an endThe cherry blossoms bloom	And the winter is about to end	I miss you	I miss you	If I can count out even just a couple of nights	I’ll go see you	I’ll go pick you upUntil the kind spring day that tells us the end of winter	Until the flowers bloom	I want you to stay, just like this	Just like thisTrans cr; Maya & Mari @ bts-trans© TAKE OUT WITH FULL CREDITS" True text
