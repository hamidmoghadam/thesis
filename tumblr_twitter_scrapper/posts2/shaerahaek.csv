So here you guys go. Another long post and no cut - sorry, not sorry.  Stephane Lambiel What google says: Swiss figure skater/coach/choreographer. Olympic silver champion, 2 times world champion What google does not say: The Freaking GOD of Spinning He’s Viktor Nikiforov the Skater He’s also Viktor Nikiforov the Coach As well as Viktor Nikiforov the Choreographer He is the Phichit-type friend (meaning the greatest) He’s got Georgi’s drama intensity, Christophe’s sexy moves and ass Yuuri’s mesmerizing footwork And Michele’s chivalry   He’s THE PRIMA BALERINA   He is THE PLAYER in the “Eros” story He’s also the most beautiful Lady in the town  And last but not least HE IS THE DUETTO  AS WELL AS THE AFTERPARTY  Bonus: he’s also the cat    Now you know who that sexy French belongs to :D    Seriously though. Stephane Lambiel is a freaking Legend. He’s a great figure skater, a fierce athlete (had many injuries, retired, then made a comeback), an amazing performer, a blessed choreographer, an attentive coach, a wonderful friend (take any figure skater and you’ll find a dorky pic of them with Lambiel).  He is loved by everyone: women, men, dogs, cats, critics, judges, audience and fellow figure skaters.  And he should be loved by you.  Don’t believe me just watch: “Poeta (Flamenco)” “Overture Rossini” “Don’t Stop the Music” “Run” " False text

It will be a while before she pulls it out. But it’s best to be prepared. After all, she knows her beloved son. It’s impossible, now that Viktor’s here, for him not to fall in love.  #mama katsuki is just adopting people up in here #toshiya is so chill but he knows what’s up so everyone loves the trope of yakov immediately reversing the shotgun talk he intended for yuuri and instead warning viktor DON’T YOU DARE LET YUURI GO, HE’S THE SON I NEVER KNEW I WANTED i feel there’s a sore lack of hiroko & toshiya taking one look at viktor nikiforov napping with his head in their son’s lap and knowing in their hearts that they will be Gravely Upset if yuuri hurts him  If I had the confidence to write from Hiroko’s POV I would absolutely bang out a fic about this because I love it so, so much. After Yuuri wins Onsen on Ice, he agonizes a bit and admits to his mother that he worked so hard to make sure Victor would stay, but now that he’s staying, Yuuri isn’t really sure what to do with him, now that Victor’s coaching is one-on-one with no Yurio around. Not to mention, what about the rest of the time! Victor’s just always around and Yuuri doesn’t want him to be bored but what’s he supposed to do, conjure a Eurotrash nightclub out of thin air for him? Fly in a bunch of Russian models and celebrities so Victor has his usual crowd to hang out with? “I don’t think Vicchan needs much,” Hiroko says. “When you and Yurio were running around and working so hard, Vicchan seemed perfectly content to spend his free time playing with his dog and reading a book.” Yuuri pulls at his own hair. “I can’t tell Victor NIkiforov to go read a book!” “Well, no, you shouldn’t say it like that,” says Hiroko. “You should be gentle with that boy’s feelings, Yuuri. He has a lot of them.” “What am I supposed to do about that?” Yuuri moans into his hands. “Whatever you decide to do, be kind to him,” she says. “Be careful not to break his heart.” “Mom. It’s not– there’s no way– it’s Victor.”  “It’s Vicchan,” Hiroko answers. “And if you let him, he’ll follow you around just like our little Vicchan did.” That sounds so crazy to Yuuri that he can only turn red and sputter, but months later, when Victor’s wrapping around him at every possible (and impossible) opportunity, he’ll have to admit that his mother was onto something.

He probably has girls and guys falling for him left and right.And then one day, Yuuri’s out with his friends, and they’re at a cafe or something.And a group of girls comes up to them, and they’re all blushing and nudging each other saying “You talk first!”.So Yuuri just turns this absolutely blinding smile on them and asks, “Autographs?”The girls squeak, and nod furiously.“Sure!” he says, reaching out for the notebooks they’re holding out for him to sign.And about ten minutes later, after several selfies and autographs and a lot of gushing and squealing and “Please let Viktor know we’re looking forward to Yuratchka’s upcoming season,” the girls leave.So Yuuri turns back to his friends, and they’re all just staring at him with wide eyes and gaping mouths.Yuuri kinda wonders if there’s something on his face.The first thing that comes out of anyone’s mouths is, “…who’s Viktor?”And Yuuri’s kinda confused as he replies, “….my husband?”“YOU’RE MARRIED!?!?!?!?” his friends all shriek.Yuuri looks down at his hand to make sure his ring is still there. “Yeah?” he says, holding his hand up.“I thought that was just a fashion statement!” one of the girls exclaims.“Why did they want your autograph though?” asks another of his friends, and Yuuri just looks away sheepishly.“I’m…uh….a retired competitive figure skater?” he asks, his voice going higher with embarrassment. “And I…uh…got 2 golds in the Grand Prix…and 2 golds in Worlds….and maybe a silver in Pyeongchang?”His voice gets progressively quieter as his face gets even redder.His friends are staring at him in horror and shocked disbelief now.And he thinks he might as well get it all out now.“And…my husband might be the most decorated athlete in figure skating history?”Fics based on this post:A Name I’ve Heard Somewhere by GwenChan (@gwen-chan)A Prince in Disguise by lourthor (@kurtdontcurr)A Real Life Cinnamon Roll by Seito (@seitosokusha)And the answer is… by nessiesauranonymous by eu_nao_sou_um_chapeu (@eu-nao-sou-um-chapeu)Comfort Zone by BertholdvonMoosburgDid I Forget to Mention… by neverevereverEthical Dilemmas in Sports Psychology: When Googling Your Friend Gets Weird by Adrianners (@adrianners)How do you not know? by missykristyicebreaker by CesareIt’s like some surprisingly inclusive and irritatingly sugar-coated rom-com by RocioWrites (@rocioandthatsall)Long time no see by ddugeun (@chukichi)My Fun Fact Is: by stillmadaboutpetraNew Friends by viktuuri (@softvictory)Now I Know by CassidyMoffett (@sweettigerotakureviews​)Of College Classes and Googling Friends by IceIceSkatersOuted By Victuuri Smut by AnonymousStorytime: Celebrity Blindness by likestoimagine (@likestoimagine16)Tale of the Russian Punk and the Japanese Cinnamon Roll by JamieAvenBellThe Internet Exists for a Reason by tomorrowsdreamsThe Moment of Truth by little_miss_laughs_alotThe Secret Life of Professor Katsuki by FreakingOutGirlThis is Why You Google People by StarlightPhoenix (@cleverlittlejay)Trivia Night by RinaRose (@marina-and-the-fandoms)Wait, What? by @realisticallycynical Yuuri Katsuki-Induced Feels by @i-w-p-chan~If you want to officially gift your work to me, my AO3/FFN penname is SkyGem!~Tumblr posts/additions for this post:Hilarious addition by @p3hero​Adorable continuation by @deadlychildartemis​Comic by @lauravianOn why Yuuri’s friends don’t know about Viktor by @blindiemacRetirement au: Yura editionRetirement au: Viktor edition by @rocioandthatsallTranslations of this post:Italian by @randomwalksoul" False text
