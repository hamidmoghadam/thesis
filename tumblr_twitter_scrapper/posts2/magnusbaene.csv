We wanted it to be incredibly visual and gorgeous. We wanted those things not to be lurid, but to be beautiful and captivating and for heterosexuals to watch the love scene between these two men and not go ‘Ew,’ but go, ‘That’s gorgeous.’” Nevertheless, even though Fuller and Green wanted to eschew luridness, they still wanted to be frank about how men have sex — something rarely depicted on television screens. Fuller wanted to challenge hetero viewers. He remembered seeing relatively tame same-sex love in movies like The Color Purple and Prelude to a Kiss and seeing straights in the audience cringe, and he wanted to get in people’s faces, to a certain extent.

The locations on this list didn’t become federally protected as a lark.  Most of them were added to this list thanks to a great public outcry, because experience had proven that nothing less was sufficient to protect them.
