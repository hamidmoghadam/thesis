a-dreamers-universe 162063627313 "2017-06-20 23:52:43 GMT" http://a-dreamers-universe.tumblr.com/post/162063627313/little-talk-about-the-series-anne-with-an-e "So, I’m sorry, but this is going to be a REALLY long post… I’ve loved Lucy Maud Montgomery’s story about Anne since forever, so… sorry if this will become something incredibly long, I hope you’ll stick with me till the end.I still remember the Japanese anime Akage no Anne coming around on television every morning when I was in Kindergarten and Primary school (and it was already almost 20 years old around then).Years later I wondered about Anne’s story a lot (in particular about the dynamic between her and Gilbert), so I decided to read the book and eventually discovered that Anne of Green Gables’ story had not one, not two but eight books!I know, right??? Unluckily, it wasn’t (and isn’t) very famous in my country, so I managed to read only the first, second, third and sixth book (borrowed from the library, until some months ago, when i found all the books and bought them spending an enormous amount of money T.T). Anyway, those where enough to let me understand what Anne Shirley’s story would evolve in someday (and what would’ve happen to her and Gil!).Naturally, since I was around thirteen and had my first computer, I started to search for more and found out that in 1985 Montgomery’s first book had been adapted into a Canadian mini-series drama and later on, in 1987, the next four books had been put into another mini-series, sequel of the above.Oh, how happy I felt when I saw my favorite literature characters on screen!Obviously the television adaptation wasn’t perfect, but the mini-series about the first book was almost perfect and the second still kept the poetic vision of Montgomery’s books (I could talk about Anne of Green Gables - the sequel’s omissions from the books all day, but still, this isn’t the topic of the post…).Anyway, I still felt like I missed something, I was wishing that someone would’ve made another series one day that would’ve brought to life these amazing characters at least as well as the Sullivan Entertainment did (Because, yes, nobody can ever tell me that Megan Follows and Jonathan Crombie didn’t do a great job as Anne and Gil!).Beside a direct to television film starring Martin Sheen which… erm… wasn’t really one of the best adaptations and had so many flaws, also in the plot, that I have seen it only once and am not going to see it again (sorry, just… nah).And beside a modern but still unexpectedly amazing web series about Anne’s first three books (if you haven’t, go and watch Green Gables Fables NOW)I discovered that Netflix was going to make a whole tv series about this marvelous story!I couldn’t be happier! Netflix had done really good tv series (”A series of Unfortunate Events” which I loved, for example) so I was really happy, and still am today, actually, so don’t worry, it is anyway a “yes for me”.So… let’s really talk about this…“Anne with an E” has been out for more or less two or three months and I’ve soaked it well enough to be able and talk about it objectively.Things I LOVED:Amybeth McNulty. Seriously, I love Megan Follows, she’s been my very first Anne on screen, and I will always recognize her as Miss Shirley… but Amybeth was AMAZING. I cannot even start to tell how perfect she was for the role without making my hands shake. She is my perfect description of Anne. Seriously, it’s like they took out of my mind the vision I had of Anne and put that on a real girl (which is kind of creepy, but anyway…). She was perfect in every way, she was stubborn, creative, full of joy and sorrow. I loved her.Lucas Jade Zumman. He was great too! I still feel like Jonathan Crombie’s portrayal was slightly more on point… his Gilbert is the cutest, but still, Zumman’s performance was, as McNulty’s, completely on point with the spirit of the character. Gilbert falls in love with Anne at first sight and it is clear in every stare he glances around. Great job!Geraldine James. This Marilla was also amazing. I also loved Colleen Dewhurts (from the Sullivan Entertainment mini-series), so it’s really hard for me to chose, but well… everything about this Marilla was great!Anne and Gil’s moments. I know, I know, this is somehow a cliche, but I’m a really romantic girl and I love their relationship, so I have to bow to the screenwriter for writing these little moments (which aren’t in the books) that still felt canon (most of them, I’ll come to this later).The menstruation moment. And yes, I’m going to call it as it is and not period, because it is SO IMPORTANT. Menstruations are, still today, a huge taboo in our society. It’s natural as it is catching a cold or bleeding from a wound, but somehow it is so horrible to talk about it. As a girl, a woman, a FEMALE, I find this outrageous… in particular in a post-contemporary world. So I’m glad they talked about it (Plus, I’ve always wondered how fictional character would’ve reacted in front of something so new, natural and weird… call me crazy, but I’m serious).The Marilla - John Blythe’s moment. This is an addition that I LOVED. It’s quite normal nowadays to have flashbacks and flashforwards into stories and I was really hoping we could have something about other characters’ back story. Since this was also CANON in the books, I coulnd’t do anything but LOVE it. And the little ribbon he gave her which then Anne wore? So lovely :3Jane Eyre’s references and titles of the episodes’ quotes. So… where do I start… Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë is my FAVOURITE BOOK OF ALL TIME. For real, if you ever ask me which book I will NEVER EVER get tired of, that’ll be it. I promise. So hearing references for the first time in another story that I loved, made me squeal of happiness. I was (and am) so excited and I totally accept Anne’s love for that story as canon.These are basically the things I found really and utterly amazing… now, it’s time for the bad part (I know, I know, but there is unluckily plenty to say).Things I… DIDN’T love:Matthew Cuthbert. I’m not really talking about R. H. Thomson’s performance as an actor, because he was good and simply following the script… It’s actually the screenwriting about the character that… we could say… I loathed. I’m not over-reacting or exaggerating… I seriously hated everything that was written for him (beside of course those moments coming canonically from the book). First of all, he talked way too much and was definitely too pro-active. I mean, Matthew loves Anne with all his heart, and that’s clear in the series, but he would’ve never left his house to reach her somewhere unknown… basically because he hardly ever left his house in general (already going to the Carmody train station to fetch the new orphan was a long journey for him). So his journey across Canada’s east coast to go and find Anne… I found it a bit OOC. Secondly: Matthew Cuthbert is SCARED of women. Completely scared of them (except for Marilla, Rachel Lynd, Anne and his long gone mother). There is NO WAY he could’ve fallen in love with a girl from school. There is NO WAY he would’ve found the courage to give her a button. There is NO WAY he would’ve gone into the girl’s clothes shop and started to talk with the above said crush of his childhood. Third and most important… as I said, Matthew LOVES Anne. He loves her and Marilla very much, so there is absolutely NO WAY he would’ve EVER thought of committing suicide just because they ran out of money. The more the series went on, the more I thought that the screen writer (who anyway did a great job for other things) didn’t understand Matthew’s character AT ALL. Nope, I’m sorry, but the only thing about Matthew in this portrayal is his name.Avonlea’s hate for Anne. Other thing I really didn’t get. Or better, I get why they used it, but I don’t get why they went for it for SO LONG. Avonlea is the beginning of a completely new life for Anne. A life full of imagination, of school, friends and flowers and new things… So why on earth did they have to make it so hard??? Seriously, it felt like the screenwriter liked Anne’s sorrow. In every single moment there were people hating on her or teasing her or hurting her feelings. In the books there are only three (let’s say four) moments which are problematic for Anne’s arrival in Avonlea: Marilla explaining to her that they wanted a boy, Rachel Lynd’s harsh words for her, Gilbert’s teasing about her hair and Josie Pye being the little miss horrible she always is. That’s it. There’s always the problem with Diana’s parents after Anne gets her drunk, but that’s quite later in the book, so it’s not a “I don’t accept an orphan in the community” kind of thing (none is Gilbert’s teasing her for her hair, but lets pretend it is, just because it is early in the book). So basically, I didn’t understand why on earth Moira Walley-Beckett felt like Anne Shirley hadn’t had enough sadness in her life and added the hate of the community, Jane Andrew’s brother picking on her being a dog every three seconds, all the girls in the school being angry with her because she walked less than 10 feets from Gilbert and all the other horrible things that happened in this series. I mean… really???The whole “we’re making the series more feminist and more stick to reality”. Yes… I mean I’m always fine with the more truthful and the historically accurate things… I mean, I’m also totally into feminism (as Beauty and the Beast did, I’m fine with that)… it’s just that… well… Anne of Green Gables is ALREADY a feminist story. Anne is an orphan, she doesn’t know her parents, she grows up until her 11 years old on her own or without adults and still, she is AMAZING. She goes to school and she becomes the best, she often is better than an older school boys and when she isn’t better she ties. I mean, as a late Nineteenth century novel, that’s already quite ahead of the time! Anne is a feminist. She goes to high school and she graduates in half of the time it was needed to. She then goes to college and takes a degree in literature. Anne is amazing on her own, there is no need to say it so many times by letting her do weird actions who would’ve and could’ve been quite dangerous (the fire at the Gillis’ house). I don’t know, I felt they went too much with that and with the “real” thing. I know this series was supposed to be more realistic… but somehow it made me feel like it had lost the poetry of the book. I don’t know how to explain it, but Anne of Green Gables books are always filled with magic. It’s like Anne, with her imagination, could take the reader in a magical world of her own and let him/her live there for a while. In this series the imagination was often left aside, and I think it’s a shame, because I would’ve definitely rather more imagination than all those useless Avonlea inhabitants being angry at Anne’s arrival in town.John Blythe’s death + absence of Gilbert’s mother. Let’s talk about this… was it really a good choice? I’m going to talk about Gilbert also in the next point of this list, so this won’t last a lot, but… John Blythe’s death was probably one of the worst things about the series (with Matthew’s character). Firstly, Gilbert is known to have skipped two years of school in the book because of his father’s illness. His family would’ve come back in Avonlea only if John was feeling better, Why did they come back if he was still so hill? Why did he have to die? Why??? What’s the point? I felt like the only real point was putting in the plot Marilla and John’s love story. Seriously, I really believe this. I can’t explain it to myself otherwise. And why on earth is Gil’s mother missing? Why? Why would he become an orphan? So that Anne could become more attached to him and have that really cringe moment with him when she says that he had been luckier that her because he had at least known his parents? Who actually thought that all of this would’ve been a good idea? Why would they talk like this in such an early stage of their relationship? This leads me to the next point…Anne and Gilbert’s relationship. Basically the thing that made me think the most. Anne and Gil’s relationship in the books is so… important. What I mean with this is that when, at the end of the first book they FINALLY become friends, it is overwhelming for the reader. If you haven’t read it, just go and do it, or at least go and watch Akage no Anne (which is basically the book itself) and you’ll understand. As a reader/viewer you wait soooooo much for them to finally have a truce, that when it happens, it is the best moment ever, I was actually sobbing and laughing at the same time when I first read it. So… what happens in “Anne with an E” is somehow… too fast, let’s say underestimated. Firstly, Anne not talking to Gilbert because her friends told her not to (because Ruby has a crush on him) is utterly horrible. Ruby does have a crush on Gilbert in the books, but it doesn’t come out as a totalitarianism or a propriety over him… Ruby is one of the sweetest girls of Avonlea, why would she do that? I found that quite horrible. Plus, Anne doesn’t talk to Gilbert in the first place because he is a boy full of himself who flirts with every single girl in school and, at the same time, teases them. Then Gilbert calls her carrots and then she starts to ignore him/tries to beat him in every subject at school/doesn’t even look at that boy. What I didn’t like in this series was the fact that Gilbert looked so cute all the time and Anne felt obliged not to interact with him because she wanted to fit in. That felt like a terribly written OOC part of Anne, I’m sorry, but it is. So basically, what then went wrong because of this, was that Gilbert and Anne hardly had a month or two of competing with each other, then John Blythe died and Gilbert LEFT SCHOOL. THAT IS THE MOST OOC GILBERT BLYTHE’S ACTION I’VE EVER SEEN. That’s why I found John’s death and his wife’s absence an absolute nonsense, because they made Gil leave, and he wants to become an amazing doctor and he wants to study a lot and go to Queens, which will lead him and Anne to live close and then it will make him win a medal and Anne a scholarship, and then both will have to give up their prices because life and they will start to work as teachers before going to college and Gil will decide to change Avonlea’s school for the White Sand’s school so Anne can be closer to Green Gables, and that will let them start their amazing friendship which will later (LATEEEEEEEER) on become a BEAUTIFUL ROMANCE AND ALL OF THIS IS MISSING BECAUSE IN THIS SERIES THEY ALREADY ARE KIND OF FRIENDS BECAUSE SHE NEVER ACTUALLY HAD THE CHANCE TO HATE HIM… Yup, as you can see, I’m quite angry at this. It’s just that… Lucy Maud Montgomery built their relationship in a masterly way, and all these moments in the series (still really cute and lot of them felt like they were well made, don’t get me wrong; I mean, Anne bringing Gilbert books from school? That’s fine with me) felt like the screenwriter forgot everything Gil and Anne have to pass through before having a real friendship. I don’t know, I haven’t really been a fan of the “I would make a terrible wife” moment. Just… why?Last, but not least, the two men who hit Jerry who start to live at Green Gables. Seriously… what is that? I already am not a fan of the whole “the Cuthberts lost all their money” because… duh, that’s what strikes Matthew’s departure at the end of the books, so how are they going to put that…? Anyway, why adding this kind of plot twist / cliffhanger at the end of it? Just, why? Please, I don’t want it to be because they want to steal the little left in the house. And please, since they’re all for the realistic stuff, please, I don’t want to see any rapes in this story. We already have so many bad things in the real world, let this little girl be… No, I’m really not a fan of this thing that happened at the end of the last episode. I wasn’t even a fan of Jerry and this friendship he builds with Anne… why is it even there? I really don’t get these additionsSo, basically, I liked this series. Really, it might feel like I didn’t, but I did, and I personally recommend it a lot. I feel like it is a series with a larger target, maybe with also some male fans here and there, because it is more “realistic” and less “girlish” as a lot of people would say. I’ve always had the idea that stories are stories anyway and that there aren’t girls or boys novels, that’s actually quite a dated way of seeing literature. I believe it would be useful for girls to read books as “The Treasure Island” as much as it would be for boys to read books as “Anne of Green Gables” or “Jane Eyre”. Anyway, I know society isn’t completely ready for this and it depends on us whether the future generations will accept this or not.I think the screenwriting of this series could’ve been done in a much better way simply sticking slightly more with Montgomery’s masterpiece… it still is a really well done tv series and the spirit of almost all the characters is still there, but the magic and poetic parts of Anne’s story are gone as well as her imagination is, and I could’t be sadder for that."

He manipulates LeFou into doing whatever he asks of him, because he knows that LeFou is in love with him. So he shows affection towards Lefou in order to get what he wants and makes Lefou believe that Gaston really likes him back, when really he’s just leading him on to use him.We see all of this when Maurice is trying to convince everyone in the tavern that there is a beast and he then confronts Lefou and says “you know I would do anything for you, right?” No, he wouldn’t. But he knows that Lefou would believe him in a heartbeat if that’s what he told him.Also, he hits Maurice unconscious and leaves him in the cold, tied to a tree. Maurice could have died if it wasn’t for agathe. This is also implied in the cartoon that this could have happened since belle saw him unconscious in the snow through the magic mirror. (Off topic)But yeah, what makes this movie so amazing is that Gaston is even more terrifying and even more of a terrible person in this version. He doesn’t have super powers or magic either. He just is a mass manipulator with a town filled with mindless followers. And then you realize how many people out there are actually like that in real life.And that’s what makes him so terrifying. Is that there are actual people out there who are just like him. Totally agree with you!Also in one of the new lines in the song Gaston he says that he doesn’t care if he isn’t fair.This kind of person is so horrible…" False text

Before watching it, I’d listened to some of the soundtrack and some clips of songs from the movie. As I’m a fan of the songs, the bar was set very high for pretty much all of them. As a whole, I preferred mainly the 1991 cast singers, especially Paige O’Hara. So here’s what I thought of each of the reinditions of the classic songs from the 1991 animated movie, into the live-action 2017 movie.  Belle:  A lively re-enactment, but I still prefer the old one to this one. Granted, they did an amazing job bringing the animated village to life, so to speak, with spectacular grandeur and beauty. Belle Reprise: Emma Watson was in fine form in this and clearly right into it! Especially love her “UGH!” This is one where I actually like the live action’s more than the animated (not to say Paige O’Hara did a bad job–she was superb, but Emma seemed to take it that little step further and made it truly her own.)  Be Our Guest: Holy shit, this was amazing. Ewan McGregor really knocked it out of the park with this one! Emma could’ve been more lively in the scene, but I must say Ewan/Lumiere really stole the show, so to speak, here. I still absolutely love the 1991 “Be Our Guest”, so in my eyes (or rather ears) this one is pretty much tied with the 1991 version for sheer energy, spectacle, and awesomeness. That first close up of Lumiere with his expression and face though–very remniscent of the start of 1991′s “Be Our Guest”, and they managed to make a candlestick candelabra look attractive. Disney, why.  I only have a couple quibbles with it: one being that really random part with Mrs Potts (if you seen the movie or full clip online you probably know what I’m talking about) where she winks at the camera and blows a kiss. It just felt out of place and out of left field to me.  The other quibble? The song ends. All things come to an end, but “Be Our Guest” was certainly the rising star of the songs in the film, including the new ones. You could say it can hold a candle up to 1991′s “Be Our Guest”. Three candles, as a matter of fact! Gaston:  As energetic and spectacular as its 1991 cousin, this had a few extra added or replaced lyrics, and Josh Gad and Luke Evans did a splendid job here. Much as I loved Josh and Luke singing in this, I definitely prefer the 1991 version over this one. Something There:  Eh, I really wasn’t a fan of this one, as I found Emma’s singing too flat and emotionless in this, and to me it sounded very much auto-tuned. Vastly prefer Paige O’Hara’s version here. Beauty and the Beast: She’s no Angela Lansbury, but Emma Thompson still managed to bring magic and beauty to this song nevertheless. I feel Mrs Potts’ gentle nature and spirit really coming through here. A gorgeous song with a magnificent scene to go with it.  Mob Song: Lots of energy and spectacle here, but I’ve only heard it once and never really listened to it again.  Finale: Sweeping and grand, it is a treat to hear Audra McDonald’s voice at the start (she always gives me goosebumps when she starts singing!), and loved the added lyrics as well that Howard Ashman had written, but didn’t make it into the animated film. Emma Thompson’s singing these new lines is truly poignant and beautiful. I can’t keep my eyes off her during this little moment–such grace and beauty here.   Daily BatB positivity post <3" False text
a-dreamers-universe 161846741088 "2017-06-15 09:12:05 GMT" http://a-dreamers-universe.tumblr.com/post/161846741088/review-anne-with-an-e-spoilers "dorianfiftyshadesof-gray: So I had just finished the Netflix series Anne with an ‘E’ with my Mum (who watched all of it a week prior to me) and I feel as if I need to give a consensus as a child who read all the books and felt that the 1985 adaptation was as close to perfect as anyone could get. I also see my younger self as a little Anne Shirley which is why I am so fiercely protective of this series and any adaptation of said series. So lets get to it:   My Praises   -The Cast: Although I do have an enternal love for Megan Follows, Jonathan Crombie, Colleen Dewhurst, and Richard Farnsworth as their respective characters; I could not imagine another better cast as the one in Anne with an ‘E’. Newcomer Amybeth McNulty undeniably shines as the fierce and imaginative Anne Shirley. She captures Anne completely with even the slightest of expressions. Lucas Jade Zumann becomes Gilbert “Heart-Eyes” Blythe with his loving smirk and utter adoration of Anne. I also commend Geraldine James for making such an exquisite Marilla. James nailed Marilla’s sterness and sensitivity. Lastly, Corrine Koslo made Rachel Lynde my absolute fave and I have no problems with that. -The Soundtrack: That upbeat and vibrant Celtic music. -The Cinematography: It felt like I was truly experiencing the world through Anne’s eyes. So stunning to watch. -The Episode Titles: I just loved this little detail they added in making all the episode titles Jane Eyre quotes. Since it is my favourite novel of all time, it did make me squeal a little everytime they mentioned it in the show. -The Directing: Speechless, honestly. Props to the 5/7 female directors. We honestly do not see enough of them in this day and age. -The Feminism!: That theme of feminism that underlyed throughout the show was something that made it stick. In a young girl’s coming-of-age story, there always should be a bit of feminism and girl empowerment to make it relatable. It was also Marilla’s coming-of-age in a way as well, becoming a “Mother in a Modern World”. -Anne & Diana’s Adorable Friendship: Bossom Friends till the end.   My Criticism   -The Anne and Gilbert Love Story: Now before you all throw your hands 'round my throat, hear me out. These two are my precious babies. They are the teenage Lizzie and Darcy. Now Lizzie didn’t talk to Darcy because “a friend liked him”. No. Lizzie didn’t talk to Darcy because of her own stupid pride. Just like Anne. I have no idea why the writers thought of that “friend obligation” thingo. Anne was stupidly proud and ignored Gilbert because of that. Gilbert also was a bit of a twat when he pulled her hair and called her “carrots” (fucking iconic) not all soft and gentle. But the rest they got right. Except for the last episode (which a will get to..) where they called “truce”. Anne and Gilbert did not call “truce” until like 3 years later. Apart from that, the kids had amazing chemistry and were extremely adorable. Could have had extra time with spelling bees and stuff though.  -The Theives: I seriously have no clue. I was literally like this at that strange cliffhanger ending “!?!?!?!?!?”. It was really out of place. -Gilbert working on the Docks: This honestly just made me really fucking mad. How is this going to change Anne and Gil’s relationship!? Is he coming back to school!? Is he going to become a doctor!!?? -The Lack of Anne’s Pride and Vanity: I wanted the Anne who accidentally dyed her hair green and climbed the roof of the school! The one who was so incredibly proud and vain. It made her relatable.    Overall, I think the pluses outweight the minuses. Y'all should give it a watch ASAP. Nothing will ever top the 1985 adaptation (or ya know the books) but this one certainly gives it a run for its money.      Totally agree!What I personally think of this series is that it is definitely well done, and you can feel Anne and Gil’s feelings, but what I didn’t like is that they completely missed the whole “Anne decides not to talk with him because she’s really angry, and THAT’S IT"".I liked the fact that it’s a new way of reading the story, but all these additions with everyone not accepting Anne… I mean they went way too much on the realistic thing and lost all the poetry of Montgomery’s story.Anne and Gil fight all the time about school and grades, so why making him leave it???I hope he’ll get back to school soon, because what makes Gilbert sooooooooo amazing is also his will to study and become an amazing doctor.Beside this, their moments are really lovely, and I like this portrayal of Gilbert. He’s quite ironic and I love it 😂" False text

Today there were sly glances at our director Bill Condon, who thankfully smiled benignly throughout. Behind him and ‘round us there was a further audience - Disney producers who we may not meet again until the movie’s premiere, plus colleagues in charge of cameras, lighting, sound, sets, costume and make-up who will be our constant companions throughout the shooting schedule.Today Beauty and her Beast (Emma Watson and Dan Stevens) read with their supporting cast: and a happy reunion it was for me, next to Mr Holmes’ “Lady in Grey” (Hattie Morahan) along from Bard the Bowman (Luke Evans) and Kevin Kline, who I haven’t seen since we received our Tony Awards together in 1981. The cast were seated 'round four long trestle tables placed in a square. In the middle on their own little stage there was a large clock and a feather duster and a candelabra, who all remained static throughout the morning. Elsewhere, everything and everyone was alive and even kicking, high-kicking too. Bill Condon had decided to put on a show and I’ve never seen or heard anything like it.I arrived nearly late after a two-hour drive across London’s morning rush-hour: and into Shepperton Studios where films have been made since 1931. There were clusters of white roses on the tables and a mike for each actor so we could be heard above the music from the electronic keyboard and percussion and the glorious voices of a 30-strong choir. They were impressive enough, until the studio lights dimmed and the chorus sprang up and danced their merry way through the classic songs by Alan Menken, who was sitting next to Tim Rice who has contributed some new ones. It’s the first time that I’ve heard applause at a read-through, let alone a standing ovation by the end. The legendary Audra McDonald had sung and Emma Thompson too (a cupboard and a teapot in the Beast’s bewitched household).But my favourite moment, because it made me weepy, was when the Beast’s loving arm was placed tentatively on Belle’s shoulder after their pas de deux. Clearly dancing and singing rehearsals had started before today. My own are to come. I’m going to have to work hard to equal what has already been achieved. All the long way home, I hummed Be my Guest, in which I shall get to sing a line or two. Aren’t I the lucky one ….." False link

Actually, I’m not a huge fan, but my boyfriend is, and when we came out the cinema we thiught the exactly same things. Everything was way too much. Smaug died in 5 minutes and, even if also in the book he doesn’t survive until the very end, everything was so fast that I seriously thought Smaug was somehow faking his death… Beside that and all of the scenes you mentioned, I also found ridiculous the scene where Bard kills a giant ogre by going on an old carriage (wagon? Whatever) and running on it down a downhill in the city near the mountain.That was definitely the moment when I lost it and started talking every single moment (which usually means that something way over the possible is happening in the film).I appreciated lots of other things, though. I loved when all the dwarves went to the doors of the mountain to say goodbye to Bilbo, and I loved the speech between Tauriel and Thranduil after Kíli’s death, but… Yes, I mean… I didn’t like it as I loved the desolation of Smaug, which is my favourite between the three of the hobbit…" False link
