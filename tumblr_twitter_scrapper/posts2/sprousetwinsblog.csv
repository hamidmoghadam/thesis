Purser will play Ethel Muggs, who has a major crush on Jughead (Cole Sprouse) in the comics. But, on Riverdale, Ethel will find herself in a romantic relationship with someone very different. Ethel will also be drawn into a friendship with Veronica (Camila Mendes) and Betty (Lili Reinhart) after they team up for a revenge plot on Reggie Mantle, a bully and Archie’s rival.
