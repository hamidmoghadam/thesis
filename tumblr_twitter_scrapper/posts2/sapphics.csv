the vice president was cishet. the cool gay adults who had cared about us and tried so hard to make us safe had hung up the towel, and instead two cishet teachers sat in with us. one of them refused to allow any gay interpretations of her curriculum, and actually gave one of my friends a bad grade on a paper because she argued there were gay undertones in a seperate peace. the other thought that my bully’s jokes about mexican people clamoring to marry americans at the airports (a joke that left my friend in tears when they heard it) was hilarious. the room was full of straight people. occasionally, a few of my friends would come with me, but mostly we would leave early. the cishet freshmen got into fights with the lgbt freshmen, and the lgbt freshmen stopped coming. it took less than three years for a safe space to become an almost all straight club, all of them piling into a room to laugh at the racist gay kid’s jokes, or to gawk at the rest of us. some of you might say “that was a small highschool club,” and you’re right!  but this isn’t a small problem. when you let cishet people into the lgbt community as anything other than staunch, serious allies, you start taking away lgbt people’s voices. and we’ve seen this already. cishet aces got representation at pride this year, while lgbt poc couldn’t talk about how they’re being abused, assaulted and murdered at higher rates than any other part of our community. online, tumblr posted pictures of the ace flag, but excluded the lesbian flag. i understand that you think you really do belong in our community, but you don’t. you deserve your own community, where you feel safe. where you don’t have to argue with us, where you can talk about the issues you face. but that isn’t with us, clearly.  and taking away our voices isn’t going to make yours any louder."

Y’all should read this because it is FIRE, but also because a post from the Time Lady Project was linked in this!   Historically, whenever young women are interested in a form of media,  we like to tell them it is bad for them and that they are bad for  liking it — unless the media goes mainstream, in which case it becomes  no longer feminine and hence okay. Novels are dangerous and cause  insanity, until they become classics worthy of being studied in college.  Beatlemania is the province of “the dull, the idle, the failures,“ until the Beatles become a band that everyone loves.  Young women are so attacked for loving the media they love that it is  a radical act for a young woman to love something unashamedly. And  transformative fandom is the most radical act of all, because it  reverses that “lady thing to respectable thing” process.  Emphasis added. It’s so good- go read the whole thing.  “That’s why as a culture we’ve decided that transformative fandom is weird and gross and morally wrong, and that’s why all the articles in the world explaining that transformative fandom is a totally legitimate way to interact with a text aren’t really making a dent in the never-ending stream of repulsed investigations of fandom. Because fandom is the province of young women and, culturally, we find young women terrifying.” This is a good article. " False link

And this just in: She’ll look very familiar! Odette Annable will play the CW drama’s new Big Bad, TVLine has learned, though we hear Supergirl‘s version of Reign — one of several “Worldkillers” in the DC universe — will differ visually from the one you might already know from the comics (pictured above). “Greg [Berlanti] and I have wanted to work with Odette for years,” executive producer Andrew Kreisberg said in a statement. “We are beyond excited to have her join our cast in the scary, powerful and heartbreaking role of Reign.” " False link

Lucky couples could cling to each other, finding a substitute for oxygen in kisses and wandering hands, enjoying the bliss that came with giving yourself over to the ocean. James and Kara were once upon a time a strong ship in an unforgiving sea. Then time and distance took hold. James became the waves, and Kara, the shore. " False link

This line, in particular, gutted me: We eat eggs and I tell Y about how when I was 8 years old, I taught my white friend, B (actually called Becky), how to count to 10 in Urdu. How at school the next day she looked at her feet as she shuffled past me, and the white teacher pulled me aside and asked me why I was bullying Becky, because Becky’s mum said I was bullying Becky, and that maybe it would be best if I didn’t sit next to her anymore. She suggested this with the kind of half-arsed, sad-eyed, apologetic shrug that white women perform when it is less of a scene to administer psychological warfare against a brown child than it is to challenge your fellow white woman. That was my entire childhood.  I remember well the acute shock and confusion of that day. I  had been so damn sure Becky and I were having a good time. I felt so  guilty, despite my mother’s insistence that Becky’s mother was a racist  bitch and that I had done nothing wrong. I felt frightened of myself and  my potential to hurt innocent white girls without even realizing it. We are taught to walk home with our keys between our fingers for  protection from men in the night, but no one tells us how to defend  ourselves from the white women who will try to ravage us from the inside  out, with a smile, a comment, a betrayal, a vital inaction, a look. How  they will choose comfort over effort, how they will read this and think  I am talking about someone else, another pardon. " False link

After Rhea (Teri Hatcher) effectively tricked Lena (Katie McGrath) into creating a portal that would allow the surviving Daxamite race to come to Earth — err, New Daxam — Kara (Melissa Benoist) will have to turn to some unlikely allies to combat this new threat, not least of which is Cadmus leader Lillian Luthor (Brenda Strong). But just because they are aligned now doesn’t mean Cadmus has stopped hating aliens. In fact, the Daxamites won’t be Kara’s only threat as Supergirl heads into its second season finale. “There’s multiple showdowns coming up,” executive producer Andrew Kreisberg tells EW. “These are some of our biggest episodes we’ve ever done.” “The finale is probably the biggest episode we’ve ever done,” Kreisberg continues. “We saved a bunch of money to pay for more visual effects and actually added another day to the schedule so we could make it as big as possible, and yet it also has multiple get-your-Kleenex scenes. We’re really excited about it. We’re all blown away.” With villains abound, Kara will also find some help from returning familiar faces Cat Grant (Calista Flockhart) and Superman (Tyler Hoechlin), both of whom she needs “desperately because she’s faced with some truly awful decisions to make in the finale,” Kreisberg says.   Kara will need all the help she can get when Superman villain General Zod (Mark Gibbon) joins the board in the finale. “It’s a great moment,” Kreisberg says of Zod’s arrival. “We needed a big, iconic Superman villain, and there really isn’t anybody more iconic, at least in terms of a physical opponent for Superman, than Zod.”   “Say whatever you want about the finales, they’re not boring,” Kreisberg says with a laugh. “It really feels like the culmination of everything we’ve been doing all season long, all the different story lines, whether it’s Superman and Cat and Cadmus and M’Gann and Mon-El and Lynda Carter and now Rhea, it all comes together in one big two-part story.” Supergirl airs Mondays at 8 p.m. ET on The CW. The finale airs May 22. " False link

The idea came from a series of tweets stemming from a 2014 photo of the ladies sitting side-by-side at a Miu Miu show. A Twitter user captioned the photo, “Rihanna looks like she scams rich white men and Lupita is the computer smart best friend that helps plan the scams,” and the internet went wild with calls for the film to be created. “I was texting with these sisters today, and there were some interesting conversations. So we’ll see what comes,” DuVernay said Monday night during Conversations on Creativity with Questlove hosted at Pratt Institute. My twitter feed is in shambles,“ DuVernay said. “I can’t even retweet anymore. It’s so many people over the last four days inundating me with it. It just feels nice like, ‘they like me, they picked me.’” “But also, I think the main thing is the idea that the people want a certain kind of film. People want Black women in centered, powerful images that are complex and layered. And that have nuance beyond what we’re relegated to. And they want it from other Black women. They chose Black writers, with Issa. Issa text me like, ‘Yooo!’ She’s on the set of Insecure trying to be insecure. And all this great stuff is happening.”  “So it just feels like, wow, this is a moment of Black women centered-ness. It’s an indicator of this voice is valid and it should be amplified. And so, I accept it as that.”  " False link
