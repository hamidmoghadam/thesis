I’ve never done commissions before, so I’d like to first start off by saying that. Please bare with me if I’m a little confusing or strange at times and feel free to send me critique’s on my business managing! The reason I’m taking on commissions now is because of two reasons! 1. I recently just got done taking a leave of absence from work to go to inpatient therapy (a mental health hospital if you will) and no longer have any savings, as it was all spent on food to support my husband, kitty, friends and snakes. 2. I’m helping one of my close friends get out of his abusive household and extra money would be helpful if things go wrong. I don’t want him to move from the south of North America all the way up to the north only to be homeless and/or starving! I have some very important rules about payment: I require half of payment up front. I don’t want to be ripped off and neither do you. I will update you on progress on your commission if you request it so that you know that your piece is getting done.  If your commission takes too long for your liking or is unsatisfactory to you I will refund you with that half of the money. If I can make changes to an unsatisfactory piece I will as soon as possible for no extra cost. Once a piece is finished I will show it via email as a watermarked version, this way it can not be refunded and stolen. If it is satisfactory I will send you the un-watermarked piece after receiving the other half of payment. Here’s what I can do: Icons of characters with backgrounds humans anthro-furries humanoid robots animals smut (must provide proof that you are 18+, sorry I will not risk it) gore/guro  Here’s what I can’t do: Automobiels and machines furry smutt characters without reference images or highly detailed descriptions extremely detailed backgrounds (hard lined and colored sceneries) smut of minors (it’s bad. no pedo’s allowed!) Reference images are below the cut, as I do not want to clog your dashboard! If you have trouble viewing the images from my blog, but are interested, IM me or E-mail me at aristotleryans@gmail.com! I’ll provide examples and prices for you! I will take 3 commissions at a time to start, if all goes well I will upgrade to 5.  1. OPEN2. OPEN3. OPEN Keep reading " False text

It has been lying around here for ages and I’ve never had the opportunity to play. So I start the game, create my abomination of a character and suffer through the horrible facial animations until I get to the part where you’re in the sewers or whatever and have to protect the emperor. He’s in a little room and his guards are outside, fighting off evil assassins. And I think, since I’m the hero of this adventure, I gotta help kill the assassins right? And so I kill them. A lot of them. They keep coming. Soon, there is a literal mountain of dead assassins in the room. They still swarm into the room like they’re being mass produced by some android assassin machine. And I’m starting to think the game glitched since it’s a Bethesda game. Turns out you actually have to not fight the bad guys and go into the room with the emperor who then tells your that he can’t go any further because ??? Like…dude, I’ve been killing those fucks out there for the past 15 minutes, you could’ve gone and hid somewhere in the meantime. But no, he stands there, patienty watching me kill 827572 assassins without moving. Only to be killed by yet another one as soon as I enter the room. And I’m not saying he’s an idiot, but someone who watches a no-name prisoner kill people who were hired to murder him instead of fleeing doesn’t deserve to be emperor" True text
