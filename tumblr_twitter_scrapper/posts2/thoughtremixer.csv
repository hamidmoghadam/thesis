The phrase “hidey hole.” Watching a budget surplus become a massive deficit that was bigger than it even looked because the White House was just like, “Okay, we’ll just not put the wars on the books and just ask for more money for those every few months.” The sheer number of times Alberto Gonzalez said, “I don’t recall,” to Congress regarding war crimes and human rights violations. “…now watch this drive.” Mission Accomplished. “The absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence,” “yellowcake uranium,” Condoleeza’s “mushroom clouds” fearmongering, and all the other bullshit we were fed to get into Iraq. The President of the United States said so many stupid things that there were one-a-day calendars consisting of an individual quote for each day of the year. They didn’t all have the exact same quotes.   “There are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns – the ones we don’t know we don’t know.” And then we went to war.  “Tonight I ask you to pass legislation to prohibit the most egregious abuses of medical research: human cloning in all its forms; creating or implanting embryos for experiments; creating human-animal hybrids; and buying, selling or patenting human embryos.” - George W.

Yeah, it was spider-hole  I think my favorite was how we un-ironically referred to a whole set of countries as the “Axis of Evil” as if that phrase gives us some kind of meaningful understanding of their geopolitical role and isn’t borrowed straight out of a mediocre made-for-TV superhero movie.  And then there was: We literally got a terrorism forecast on the news every morning like it was pollen. So many of the things that happened, if they were in a dystopian novel, people would be like, “That’s way too goofy and ridiculous to actually happen in real life,” and yet they did.  THE LAST ONE’S REAL?  Yeah https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeland_Security_Advisory_System  Not only was the terror threat system real, but it was often raised and lowered based entirely on how panicked they wanted us to be. Famously they raised the level for no reason during the 2004 election. Also, “Free Speech Zones” looked something like this: It was literally a cage.  I genuinely forget that people, even within my own age group, has forgotten the Bush era since they were teenagers and below the voting age at the time, and so forgot how fucking horrifying it was.  @janiedean  How can everyone forget this gem? “Rarely is the question asked: is our children learning?” -George “W” Bush.

Maybe you’ve heard her as Susie Carmichael on Rugrats or as Freddie Brooks on A Different World. Or maybe as Elmyra Duff on Tiny Toon Adventures or the Green M&M in those commercials. That’s just a handful of the more than 200 gigs she’s landed in her 30-year career as one of the few successful black women voice actors in animation. Summer grew up on an Indian reserve called Red Pheasant with her mother, father, and brother in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. They didn’t own a television. She started doing voice-overs when she was eleven. She sings, too, and released a solo rock and roll album, Street Faërie, in 1999. And she regularly sports a top hat, two braids, and a renegade attitude. She collects comic books—like Elfquest, about elves who live in the forest and ride wolves—that she binds in leathers. She smokes pot. She calls her two daughters Hero and Brave “The Savages” and her closest friends and people she admires “freaks.” Cree Summer is the epitome of black girl cool. What’s your relationship with television now? I like TV. Just the other day I was watching The Get Down, I’m an avid comic book collector and it was shot like a comic book to me. It’s like pitch perfect, that show. Moments like that, when I watch something that just moves me like an incredible documentary or an incredible movie or series, are you kidding? TV can be exceptional and have an amazing impact. I was getting chills and inspired watching it. It’s that feeling of when a seed is planted and when an idea is born, and the electricity of that—it’s so inspiring it just made me want to turn off the idiot box and go make something. It’s been 25 years since the world was introduced to Susie Carmichael on Rugrats. How did you land that role? I’ve been doing cartoons since I was a little girl so I am very, very lucky that oftentimes I do just get offered roles. Knock on wood, chile. That was one of the characters that was beautifully placed in my lap. I don’t even think I was aware at the time how kick-ass Susie was. But in retrospect, I really appreciate her profoundly. She was wonderful, right? She wouldn’t take no shit from that bitch Angelica, she was kind to the babies, and she also was really strong in character. Susie was the kind of chick that you’d really want to be. Susie came at a time when I don’t think we were seeing a lot of little black girls in animation or a lot of little black girls on TV, period. I think she moved a lot of people and made us feel good about ourselves. She was articulate, she was kind, she was talented, she was smart. And she had hair on her head that actually resembled that of a black girl. Wasn’t that so thoughtful? Klasky-Csupo [the animation company behind Rugrats] was a real class act. How has the animation world changed for women of color since that role? Not very much, unfortunately. Things have pretty much stayed the same. I think I’m qualified to comment on that ’cause I do all the black characters. There’s not a lot of them. The good news is now we’re seeing some black female superheroines, but you can still probably count them on one hand. That’s a drag. The numbers haven’t changed. But I think that also has to do with this weird idea that little black girls don’t watch cartoons, and we sure the fuck do. You’ve played a vast number of characters, but you also have a very distinct voice. How do you prepare for each role? The good news is you always get to see a picture of them. I look at the picture and that picture usually gives me a little bit of indication of what they sound like. They also tell me what age they are, where they come from and things like that. I just look at the character, look at the lines, and read it until it feels like it’s authentic or like I completed a real character with dimension. I will tell you something funny because my voice sounds like I dragged my vocal chords down a dirt road and then doused it in Jack Daniels and mentholated Cools. Sometimes when I go to play a princess, I’ll get about three lines in and they’ll say, “Stop. Do you mind reading for the villain?” That’s what was the magic of doing Princess Kida for Disney [in Atlantis: The Lost Empire]. At that time, we hadn’t really seen a princess with balls like Kita had. Now, princesses have become so much more liberated, thank God. You also made a huge impact in your on-screen role as free-spirited and outspoken Freddie Brooks on A Different World. I read that at the time you didn’t love your hair. How did that change? When I first started A Different World, I had brown curly hair just like Jaleesa [Dawnn Lewis] and Debbie Allen [the producer/directer] wanted it to be different, so she dyed it red. I was so traumatized by it. I had never put any product or anything in it to change my hair, and then the texture changed and all of a sudden I had this bright red hair. I felt like a clown. But don’t forget, too, I was a teenager, when things like that really get under your skin. I probably wouldn’t be fazed by shit like that now. But at the time, I was a little pissed about it. But then here’s the good news: Eventually, it didn’t matter. The character was so distinct they weren’t worried about telling me apart from anybody. They just let it grow out and the color grew out and I just started wearing my hair the way it was.

Although Life After Hate was scheduled to receive $400,000 during the final days of President Barack Obama’s administration, according to a report by Politico. After President Donald Trump’s administration decided to review the $10 million grant list “Countering Violent Extremism” of which Life After Hate was a part, it decided that that program should be dropped. It is unclear what their rationale was for doing so, since Homeland Security did not respond to Politico’s inquiries for comment. That said, the organization’s founder Christian Picciolini said that they have received a twenty-fold increase in requests for help since Election Day, suggesting that it needs funding more than ever. According to their website, “Life After Hate, Inc., a 501©(3) U.S. nonprofit, was created in 2011 by former members of the American violent far-right extremist movement.” Their goal is to help former members of neo-Nazi and other extreme right-wing groups move away from them.

This might not affect full-time workers,  since many employers have traditionally offered coverage for employees  who work 40 hours a week or more. However, ACA repeal would allow  companies not to provide coverage for those who work, say, 35 hours a  week. (2) Preexisting Conditions Could Keep You From Getting Coverage  “Under the ACA, employers cannot impose a waiting period for coverage of a pre-existing condition,” writes JoAnn Volk at Health Affairs Blog.  “Prior to the ACA, individuals who became eligible for an employer  plan—for example, once hired for a new job—might have to wait up to 12  months for the plan to cover pre-existing health conditions.” Volk adds that coverage under another plan might “buy down” the  waiting period, with certain restrictions. But if we return to pre-ACA  rules about pre-existing conditions, losing your job and not being able  to afford COBRA might mean going a whole year without coverage once you  find another job with health insurance benefits.  (3) The End of Coverage for Dependents Until Age 26  Obamacare extended health insurance coverage to dependents until age 26.  Currently, this means that if you’re under age 26 and your parents’  health insurance covers children, you can stay on it until your 26th birthday.  That provision is likely to go away under a replacement plan, meaning  that if you’re covered under your parents’ insurance — or your adult  kids are covered on yours — you’d have to make other arrangements. (4) The Return of Lifetime Caps  “None but the very rich can afford to get seriously ill in America and hope to pay for it themselves,” wrote Roger Ebert at The Guardian in 2010 after President Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act into law. Before Obamacare, even having health insurance was no guarantee. That’s because many insurers instated annual and lifetime caps  on how much they would pay out. Get a serious illness requiring  extended hospitalizations, repeated surgeries, or expensive medications,  and you could wind up going bankrupt.  (5) More Out-of-Pocket Costs Obamacare put a cap on how much insurance companies could require policy holders to pay out of pocket.  The end of ACA likely means the end of this protection, meaning that  you could have continuous coverage and still have trouble paying for  your medical care. (6) Access to Birth Control ACA mandated that insurers provide birth control, e.g. the pill, IUD, implants, etc., free of charge (with a few exceptions). Partly as a result, abortion rates fell to their lowest since 1973, when the procedure became legal in every state. Replacement plans probably will not provide cost-free birth control. (7) You Might Wind Up Stuck in Your Job If Congress repeals the Affordable Care Act without a replacement that  contains protections that apply to your situation, you might think twice  about changing jobs and risking loss of coverage. Becoming a freelancer  or reducing your hours would also be difficult, as you might not be  able to buy affordable insurance on your own. " False link

To see somebody who has worked as hard as he did for as long as he did to end up barley getting by is heartbreaking.

Why? Because he wasn’t pulled over for smoking weed, he was pulled over for a busted tail/break light. Now, had the officer said, sir I smell marijuana, then he would have this called probable cause, which means he could’ve searched the car for drugs or whatever else.
