rafi-dangelo 162792819175 "2017-07-09 19:09:24 GMT" http://soletstalkabout.com/post/162792819175/male-tennis-players-still-feel-the-need-to "John McEnroe is promoting his new book and couldn’t resist flapping his gums about Serena Williams, the world’s best tennis player and one of the greatest athletes of all time.Serena Williams has asked John McEnroe to respect her after he stated the 23-time Grand Slam champion would be “like 700” in the world tennis rankings if she played on the men’s tour.“If she played the men’s circuit she’d be, like, 700 in the world,” said McEnroe, while promoting his latest memoir But Seriously.“That doesn’t mean I don’t think Serena is an incredible player, and I suppose anything’s possible; maybe at some point a women’s tennis player can be better than anybody.""I just haven’t seen that in any other sport, and I haven’t seen it in tennis. If she had to just play the men’s circuit, it would be an entirely different story.”Williams responded on Monday evening, stating: “Dear John, I adore and respect you but please please keep me out of your statements that are not factually based.""I’ve never played anyone ranked ""there” nor do I have time. Respect me and my privacy as I’m trying to have a baby. Good day sir.“(cont. Telegraph UK) Tennis is one of those sports where men repeatedly feel the need to say to women ""ok you’re good, but you can’t beat me” as if letting her be good on its own is too threatening to your manhood.  I know this isn’t that important and John McEnroe has always been an obnoxious little shit but I do randomly want to make a few points about comparing women’s athletics to men’s athletics.One. Women are relatively new to sports.Women have always played sports, but for a very large chunk of modern history, it was more recreational in nature than competitive.  Women’t weren’t expected to put in the same amount of time, effort, and energy that men would.  Men have always been urged to express their masculinity and dominance through sport ever since we stopped beating each other up on the savanna to impress a mate.  That means when you compare women in a sport to men in a sport you have to take into account where the baseline is and women have improved far more than men in every area of athletics over the past century or so.  Check out this graph comparing the Freestyle Swimming world records held by men and women and note difference in times at the beginning of the last century and how much closer they are now.You can repeat that data plot in most fields and the trend is the same.Two.  Women have started to beat men in sports where strength isn’t as integral to the competition. Women & men compete against each other in equestrian events and women have beaten men in racing, dressage, show-jumping, and eventing.  Back in 2002, Pamela Reed won the 135-mile Badwater Ultramarathon against a mixed field.  Seven years ago a female bowler became the first woman to win a PBA tournament when Kelly Kulick beat 60 men in the Tournament of Champions. (x)  So you can see that any argument that begins with “men are better athletes” is solely based on strength.Three.  Men are physically stronger than women, so you can’t compare them.Mike Powell holds the long jump world record at 29 feet 4.25 inches and he’s 6'2.  If John Smith, who I clearly just made up for this argument, is competing in the long jump and his personal best is 29 feet 2 inches, obviously Mike Powell’s jump is farther so objectively, he’s the winner.  There’s no grey area there.  But if John Smith is 5'7 which means he clearly has shorter legs than a guy who is six inches taller than him, wouldn’t you say that John Smith is the better long jumper?  Mike has a physical advantage over John because he’s taller and he’s probably going to beat him every time, but inch for inch, John is doing more work and he’s the better athlete because he had a bigger obstacle to overcome.That’s how I look at men’s and women’s tennis.  Men are naturally more predisposed to build muscle so they are going to be stronger and faster.  In a game where strength and speed are paramount, the best man is going to beat the best woman.  If you really want to take the measure of the best man and woman, don’t compare them to each other – compare them to their competition.If I put John Smith against other people who are 5'7 and he blows them out of the water whereas Mike Powell barely beats other guys his own height, then John Smith is a better athlete than Mike Powell.  The same goes for Serena Williams.  There’s no man you can compare to other men’s tennis players who catch match the way Serena Williams compares to other women’s tennis players.  Serena Williams is the better athlete even if she can’t beat the best guy on the men’s side.Four.  Serena Williams is having a baby.And she won a tournament while pregnant.  Until some man does that, they can all have a seat in the back."

rafi-dangelo 162687728630 "2017-07-07 00:30:58 GMT" http://soletstalkabout.com/post/162687728630/is-there-a-line-between-cultural-appropriation-and "The Real Housewives of Potomac had their season finale Sunday when the Grand Dame of Who Cares About Northern Virginia had a party to celebrate her 20th Anniversary with her husband.  And it was Indian themed.A bunch of Black women in saris had the internet primed and ready to call them out for obvious cultural appropriation.  If you are not Indian, why are you going to a Bollywood party dressed like one?  You can run a Twitter search for “cultural appropriation” and “#RHOP” to find a lot of people who were upset about that party.I feel like I should have been upset too…but I wasn’t.  So now I’m trying to figure out where the line is between appropriation and appreciation.Let me just pause by saying I think the cast looked great.  Right or wrong, if you are going for Fancy Indian Outfit, the least you can do is go to an actual Indian clothing store and have the guy help you pick out stuff so you can show up and show out in your best light.  That’s what they did and he really did right by them.Anyway, I was in a little discussion about this online because this white girl named Amber on a Housewives messageboard said that it was such a double standard that this party hadn’t gone viral and that if white people did something like this, they’d be ripped to shreds.Pause:  White people regularly make money off of appropriating Indian fashion and culture – ex. every white girl pop star from Gwen Stefani to Mandy Moore.  It’s never more than a low buzz of distaste, not outright viral ripping to shreds, and this was just a party.  There’s no telling how many white people have thrown parties like this and gone unnoticed.When I pointed that out to her, her immediate response was that I’m Black and they’re Black so I’m trying to give them a pass, but when white college students throw ghetto parties the whole internet tries to get them expelled.  And THAT RIGHT THERE is why I’m less bothered when minorities throw well-meaning events appreciative of other minorities.  When white people do it, they have a tendency to revert to racist stereotypes that aren’t about celebrating and only serve to perpetuate harmful discriminatory practices in this white-dominant society. Too many white people don’t know how to maintain context and keep the conversation on the same playing field.  When a white girl says you can’t call her Becky because she can’t use the n-word, that tells you everything you need to know about her worldview and how she has no idea how to stratify discrimination.  That whole attitude immediately makes me want to defend this party, but let’s just take white people out of the conversation entirely.  Is this party an example of cultural appropriation or just awkwardly executed appreciation?  Well, according to how we define cultural appropriation, it’s still a mixed bag.First of all, cultural appropriation, like racism, is partly defined by a power structure that only works from the top down because there’s no way to enforce or institute prejudice from the bottom up.  A Black person not liking white people leads to white people getting their feelings hurt.  There is not now nor has there ever been a system in place to discriminate against white people.   A white person not liking Black people feeds into a system of legalized discrimination against Black people that we are still fighting against.  Cultural appropriation is the same way, so in a sense, Blacks and Indians in the US are on the same playing field as minorities in a white-dominant country.  However, culture and race are separate entities and they’re not interchangeable.  These Black women do actually hold the power because they get to participate in American culture to a greater extent than Indian immigrants.  It’s not that all Indians are immigrants or anyone from an Indian background is automatically on the outside of American culture looking in, but this party isn’t a celebration of Indians living in America being embraced by day to day American life.  This is a celebration of heritage from India.  Think of it like this:  The way these women dress day to day, because it’s a part of their culture as Americans, is far more acceptable in this country than the “culture” they’ve put on for this one night.  That’s the power structure.The other big part of cultural appropriation is colonial in nature.  Here comes the dominant culture sniffing around something created by a minority community to   make it palatable for the mainstream,   steal it,   denude it of any heritage, disrespect it, or a combination.  Iggy Azalea putting on a black-cent that couldn’t be further away from her culture to make southern-sounding rap palatable and fashionable for the mainstream because it’s coming out of a white girl is obvious cultural appropriation.  Those white girls in Portland who went to Mexico and spied on little old Mexican ladies so they could steal the recipes and open their own shop?  Cultural appropriation.  White folks using Black slang with no knowledge of where it comes from, and then eventually using it incorrectly is cultural appropriation – Bye, Felicia.  And wearing a Native American headdress for fun, whereas Native Americans themselves reserve that right for men with a certain standing in their society, is cultural appropriation.  THIS is OBVIOUSLY cultural appropriation.When Monique showed up and thought she was being cute by dressing up as a Native American Indian as opposed to the Bollywood theme, I wanted to throw a shoe at the TV because I actually liked her all season and I didn’t realize she was this dumb.  Nobody should be wearing feather headdresses anymore.  I thought we all knew better by now.For the rest of the ladies who followed the dress code, there was nothing colonial in nature about the party.  I don’t actually know if anything they’re wearing has cultural significance that shouldn’t be worn by anyone who isn’t a part of that culture like the Native American war bonnet, but any Indian folks can feel free to let me know if I’m wrong about that.  (Also of small note: If the Indian guy who dressed them didn’t let them know they shouldn’t wear something, the cast would have no way to know they were being offensive either).Possibly most important of all is the actual community that’s being portrayed.  If the community has said to everyone outside of it “Don’t do X because it’s cultural appropriation,” then that’s what it is and you can easily find something else to do.  Enough of the Native American community has told us not to wear war bonnets, so we shouldn’t.  Enough of the Black community has told Iggy Azalea to stop using our accent to sell her records, so she should stop.  I’ve never heard an outcry about wearing Indian fashion or throwing a Bollywood party (which is celebratory in nature and not the racist garbage being proposed by Amber and her ghetto bash).  The Real Housewives of Potomac certainly doesn’t have the kind of viewership to make it a cultural touchstone so it’s not like a ton of Indians saw it anyway, but the Internet can make any offense viral regardless of how many people experienced at the source.  If this party were truly offensive, I feel like we would’ve heard it by now.Anyway, this isn’t something I’ve ever put much thought into so any compelling argument to the contrary is welcome.  I don’t really care about anybody’s opinion but mine on a lot of stuff because I been sitting around actually researching it for months and years and I ain’t being shown something I haven’t already considered, but in this case, I’m not really stuck in this position.  Say whatever you want and it’ll just add to my greater edification on the subject and a possible restructuring of how I feel.One last thing I forgot: the reason I called it harmlessly obnoxious is I don’t think this party serves to perpetuate any harmful stereotypes the way some “culturally themed” parties do.  I do however think a bunch of bougie Black women going to an Indian-themed party because the host thinks foreign countries are exotic is hella obnoxious."

Shaub, Jr.Director(Twitter) I like how he italicized that one phrase in his letter – public service is a public trust – because this administration for damn sure cares naught about that.  Still, Shaub is a better man than me.  I woulda just straight up said “Y'all ain’t shit, I'ma go collect these coins elsewhere for a job where people actually listen to me.”Shaub did his best and, though I don’t know what his political leanings are, I have to believe he took a bipartisan approach to it since he started working for the OGE under Dubbya and was then appointed Director by Obama.  The fact that his term ended next year and he still couldn’t stick it out says to me that he was tired of pointing out the bullshit from the Trump Administration and being ignored.  I’d probably prefer working for an organization where my voice mattered too.Shaub, an attorney, has accepted a job with the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan organization of election-law experts.Thursday morning, Shaub told NPR that “the current situation has made it clear that the ethics program needs to be stronger than it is. At the Campaign Legal Center, I’ll have more freedom to push for reform. I’ll also be broadening my focus to include ethics issues at all levels of government.”He did not elaborate on what is so wrong with the “current situation,” but Shaub has been sharply critical of Trump’s approach to ethics compliance since the election.(cont. NPR)When ex-lobbyists were handed ethics waivers to work under this administration, Shaub requested they be made public.  His request was denied.  When Struggleanne Conway was on Fox News talmbout “go buy some of Ivanka’s crap” in direct violation of ethic standards, Shaub suggested some kind of punishment.  His suggestion was ignored.  When Shaub was blamed for holding up Trump’s cabinet appointees because he had concerns about ethics violations due to their extensive business dealings, he suggested maybe Cheetolini pick some candidates who weren’t so obviously beholden to their stocks and financial interests.  He was ignored.So Shaub is giving the finger to the foolishness and is taking a job with a nonprofit focused on voting rights and reforming campaign finance. Who is on the ground now trying (and failing) to keep President Velveeta in check?  I bet whoever gets picked to replace Shaub definitely won’t be quitting because they feel ineffective.  I doubt they’ll even show up to work."

The reason we don’t have a majority wins population based Presidential election is because the old white men who framed the country were smart enough to realize how stupid most people are.  That’s the bottom line.  They wanted to create a system to prevent the people from voting on passion and instinct against the greater good of the country.  James Madison specifically argued against a process where “mischiefs of faction” could sway an election, and by his definition, a faction is “a number of citizens whether amounting to a majority or minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.”  If that were to happen, it would be up to the electors to say hey…the people screwed up and we can’t let this happen. That’s what’s supposed to be taking place in our state capitals today.  If the Electoral College and our convoluted process toward electing a President was actually effective, the electors would be taking all of the facts into account and then deciding on the best course for America…which obviously isn’t Donald Trump.  Instead, the process has failed us twice.   Keep reading  Just wanted to remind y’all that the Electoral College is worthless and we’re in this mess because they didn’t do what they were created to do, which was protect the people from electing an idiot.Also, y’all’s arguments against dismantling it are worthless, namely that the President would be elected by two states: NY & CA.  Yes they have large populations.  No, everyone living there is not a Democrat, and if you go by party registration across the country, Republicans and Democrats are about equal.  Just because a lot of votes for the Democrat would come from densely populated areas while a lot of votes for Republicans would come from people living in empty spaces doesn’t mean anyone in any of those places had more say in electing the President.  The Electoral College actually does give some people more weight because their empty states get handed electoral votes disproportionate to the number of people who live there and then ALL of those votes go to one candidate even if 49% of the people didn’t vote for them.But keep in mind that it’s likely more people, especially people in solidly red or blue states, would actually vote if they felt their vote mattered.  In our current system, if you already think your area is going to vote for one and you wanted the other, you’re more likely to sit at home instead of waste your time standing in line because your vote will ultimately be tossed at the end of the day anyway.  " False text

She just wants to dance with somebody who loves her, and who can blame her?”How dare you.  Whitney was playing the pop star because she was out here breaking a mold.  There was no BLACK WOMAN whose voice was birthed and nurtured in the church who had ever been in position to utterly destroy pop music.  We all know what time it is.  White people get scared when you have too many opinions, especially back then, so the best way out is to just smile through it!“For her part, Houston does the best she can to keep up with the album’s dance-fever settings. On the first track, for instance, she carefully pronounces ”everything” as ”everythang,””Um…she’s a Black woman from New Jersey recording in Atlanta?  That’s just how we fucking talk?  Is she supposed to be enunciating for the Broadway stage?“Does it matter that I’m Your Baby Tonight is utterly without content, both musically and lyrically (”And in the morning when I kiss his eyes”)? Not really, if what you’re looking for is music with a shiny surface.”Excuse me, but every syllable of the title track is absolutely necessary.  ""Anymore"" is THE kiss-off track of 1990.  Did he miss the entire plot of “My Name Is Not Susan”?  Get your life.“Houston wants to be dressed up, paraded around, and supplied with ready-made things to sing and feel.”WHITNEY HOUSTON MAKES THE SONG WORTH LISTENING TO!  She turned the Star Spangled Banner in to a masterpiece of drama and theater!  She’s not being supplied things to feel – SHE BRINGS THE FEELING AND THE INTERPRETATION LIKE NO ONE ELSE CAN!“Sometimes you just want to lie in a lump on your couch and not bother. That way, you don’t actually have to feel anything, and you don’t risk getting hurt. While the rest of humanity struggles to cope with everyday trauma, Whitney Houston has it all figured out. D+”Y'all this absolute joke of a music journalist gave Whitney’s 2nd-best album a DEE PLUS.  And he went on to have a career for the next 27 years and is still out here reviewing music.  He is a CONTRIBUTING EDITOR to Rolling Stone and he didn’t have the ear, taste, knowledge, or prescience to recognize the greatness of Whitney Houston.  I’m never reading another review of anything ever in my life.  That whole industry is some bullshit and IDK why we let them influence the media we consume.  If the recommendation doesn’t come from someone I know whose taste I rock with, it’s going in the garbage. I really want to go beat this man’s ass.  I’ve never wanted to punch a stranger so badly in my entire life." True text

Rarely do we consider working with what we already have. Think about it: when was the last time you wore your hair as is? This season, we’re challenging you to embrace your hair and rock a style that works with your natural texture, not against it.Not convinced? Just take a look at the three POPSUGAR staffers ahead who have each come to love their unique hair texture over the years and revealed their tips for showing it off. Whatever your hair type, their relatable stories and gorgeous no-fuss styles will inspire you to rethink it the next time you find yourself reaching for a hot tool.(cont. POPSUGAR)  This article isn’t all that important, but look at the women chosen to “rock their natural hair.”Who thinks of these women when you hear the phrase natural hair? I just want to make a plea:  Women outside of the African diaspora, please stop saying “rock your natural hair.”  You can call it virgin.  You can call it unprocessed.  You can call it anything other than natural hair because that’s a movement for Black women.  I’m not saying this as part of an overreach of cultural appropriation accusations at all, because this has nothing to do with that.  This isn’t the n-word conversation where the answer to “can I say it too?” is always an emphatic NO! from the majority of people. And I have no problem with women of all backgrounds embracing the hair as it sprouts from their heads without the addition of heat or chemicals.  I support any trend where women aren’t doing damage to part of themselves to fit a beauty standard.But.  The women in these photos have never not been allowed to wear their hair without chemicals or damaging processes.  There has never been a point in history these women couldn’t just wash and go, even if that meant a wash and go with a hair band.  The hair types on these women are always acceptable in any business or social situation.  They’ve never been denied a job because of their hair.  They’ve never been told they’re aggressive or too political because of their hair.  Their hair has never been illegal.  (You can have a different conversation about countries where women have to cover their hair, but that applies to all women, not just women of a certain race, and it applies to all hair, not just hair that’s kinky, so the legality isn’t based on hair at all.)Black women rocking their natural hair has nothing to do with white women learning to manage their frizz.  Those are two separate conversations.  One is about actually fitting into society and the other is about managing a beauty standard that always caters to women who look like you anyway.  The natural hair movement is about re-teaching Black women how to care for their hair after all of that knowledge was lost to our people when we were dragged to this continent and forced to use sheep shears and banned from traditional African hairstyles.  Natural hair blogs and messageboards and haircare lines aren’t just educational resources, but emotional ones as well, where Black women can discuss their struggles embracing their natural kinks and coils in a society where the beauty standard for hair is the women in these pictures instead.  When non-Black women take up the charge of “rocking their natural hair” it dilutes the conversation and it makes it harder to connect.  There are way more non-Black women than Black women in this country and they will drown out the voices who needed the support the most if allowed to.So as a courtesy, find some other banner.  The natural hair movement wasn’t started for y'all or by y'all and it’s not as integral to y'all’s culture or survival.  So just use a different term.  Once again, y’all saw something cute and catchy that Black people were doing, wanted to capitalize on it, and whitewashed the meaning out of it.  Skipping your weekly blowout in the summer has nothing to do with taking the risk of being fired if you waltz into work without a mid-length sew-in and your coils on display instead.  Find another way to share white girl hair tips.  Please.Edit: I really don’t get what’s so hard to understand about this."

That comes out to be more than one gun for every adult.Half of those guns belong to just 3% of the adult population. These super-owners have anywhere between eight and 140 guns each, with the group average being 17, according to the study.Overall, there are an estimated 55 million gun owners in the U.S.: Most have an average of three guns; half own one or two guns; and the number of guns owned by Americans has gone up by 70 million over that same time period.(cont. Fortune)That’s all thanks to the NRA and paranoid gun people infecting the simple-minded with propaganda like this.  They love to say the Left is violent, the Left is dangerous, the Left is a threat to America, but our President never encouraged gun owners to shoot another politician.  The vast majority of mass shootings are committed by conservative White men.  Random acts of politically motivated violence are almost always rooted in xenophobia, racism, or religion on behalf of a straight white Christian who loves America.  And we don’t have any ads serving as a call to arms to protect ourselves against the demonstrably violent actions of the Right.I live in New York City and I will always live in a city like this, be it Los Angeles or San Francisco or Seattle or some other liberal bubble safely insulated from the paranoid red wasteland of the United States at large.  I think gun ownership is stupid and the Second Amendment makes no sense in a modern society having little in common with the daily life or political climate of the Founding Fathers.  But if I lived in a small city in Alabama or a rural area in Oklahoma, I’d have a permit and a gun, because crazy gun people are crazy.  It actually scares me that there are people who think this way and they’re out here stockpiling a hundred guns waiting for a reason to use them.  I don’t trust them not to instigate confrontation in a war wholly imagined inside their tiny little paranoid brains and I wouldn’t feel safe living anywhere near them.The fact that this video was made means the NRA knows it would be warmly and enthusiastically received by enough people to warrant the time and effort to create it.  I don’t feel safe next to those people and my thoughts are with all y’all who have to live and work with them."

But you shouldn’t have to be among the wealthiest of Americans to serve properly in Congress.”Chaffetz – who said he sleeps in his office whenever he’s in Washington – noted, “I flat-out cannot afford a mortgage in Utah, kids in college and a second place here in Washington, DC.”  (cont. CNN) That last sentence makes me want to throw America’s whole garbage ass into a fire and start over.   He can’t afford kids in college and a second mortgage while other families around this country can’t even afford rent in a cramped single bedroom apartment!  There are three easy ways Congress could fix this shining example of a first world problem if I’ve ever seen one and none of them involve a government handout.1) Rent an apartment outside of DC.The vast majority of the people who work in Washington DC commute from Maryland and Virginia because the money they make isn’t enough to cover the cost of living in a city center.  Go to Virginia and getchu a tiny studio for $1,000 a month if you need a second home.2) Make your kids work to pay their tuition the way you tell the rest of us to.  Why are you paying for your kids’ tuition?  That’s not teaching them good Republican bootstrapping work ethics.  Make them work for it the way y'all’s parents had lil summer jobs scooping ice cream.  True, that summer job no longer pays for tuition and your kids will have to work full time all year to try and make ends meet, but hey.  Y'all set it up that way for the rest of us.3) Downsize at home. Your kids are in college now.  I already know you have a big house in Utah because anybody this entitled definitely has a big house.  Sell it and get a small one.  You really don’t need all that space.  The overwhelmingly vast majority of this country survives on way less.The audacity of this guy wanting a handout so he can maintain a standard of living most of us have no way to mentally grasp is just astounding.  Go to the Wall Street Journal right now and put in your salary to see what percentile you’re living in.  This is Jason Cheesehead and every member of Congress (some actually make a bit more if they’re in leadership positions).That right there is why our politicians say you can just buy fewer iPhones to afford insurance or you can just go get a better job with better benefits or you can just stop buying fancy coffees and buy a house instead.  They have no comprehension of what it’s like to be an average American.  Never mind what it’s like to be poor, they don’t even know what it’s like to be middle class!  And the worst part is, most people making that much money feel like they’re middle class because America is a country where everyone is just waiting to get rich.  They’ll hit their break and get rich.  They’ll come into a large sum of money and get rich.  They’ll be discovered or rewarded or promoted and get rich.  Even the rich have dreams of getting rich because they have no idea how rich they are compared to most people.  Jason Chaffetz is trash and, honestly, so are most of our politicians because they’re making economic policy from the cushiony stability of trying to afford a second mortgage in one of America’s most expensive markets while the rest of us are trying to keep the lights on."

Guys on major sites like those tend to resemble a gaggle of (mostly) white Ken dolls who look like they just met up in the dining hall of Aryan University after ultimate frisbee and decided to rub their naughty parts together.And that, at least studio heads seem to think, is what gay porn consumers want: mostly white, mostly hairless, mostly young bros. As a result, it’s no secret that there’s a major racial disparity in the gay porn industry; according to one tally by porn industry blog Str8UpGayPorn (a NSFW link if there ever was one), just 2.8 percent of Sean Cody’s lifetime roster of 1,024 models have been people of color. And though Sean Cody is the WalMart of gay porn, that studio is far from alone. Just like its dating apps, its media and its bars, the gay community’s porn is pretty racist.So why is black gay porn one of the most viewed categories on Pornhub, America’s most popular porn emporium (empornium)? And why is it that, across the country, most guys are seeking out anything but your standard twink?(cont.)I see these data “analyses” every year and every year they miss the obvious: When you look for gay porn, you don’t have to do a special search for white/masc/musc/mid-20s. That’s just the default.This study only measures what people search for, not what’s getting the most views. So yes, if you want to see something other than what’s presented, you have to search for it, but that doesn’t mean Black is the most popular gay porn in the South. It’s just the most popular category that people have to go looking for if they want something other than the standard fare.Devoid of a big population of non-white residents like the South (Black) or the Southwest (Latino), it defaults to special categories of white. The uptick in Black porn in the South isn’t a bunch of white guys jacking off to old Cocodorm clips and then ignoring Black guys on Grindr. There are some, but most of those views are from Black people because those places have huge populations of Black people. Same for Latinos. This isn’t breaking news or some big revelation into jacking off habits.  Most people are still watching standard white guy porn.  If it wasn’t making the most money, it wouldn’t be the overwhelming fave for studios to go to.The most exciting thing for me was that almost 40% of the gay porn clicks were from women. Find them for me because…" True link

But the reason the party has lost all four special elections is glaringly simple. It is not some deep and fatal malady afflicting its messaging, platform, consultants, or ad spending allocation methods. Republicans have won the special elections because they’ve all been held in heavily Republican districts.The special elections exist because Donald Trump appointed Republicans in Congress to his administration, carefully selecting ones whose vacancy would not give Democrats a potential opening. It feels like Democrats somehow can’t win, but that is entirely because every contest has been held on heavily Republican turf.(cont.)News: This Republican candidate, picked to fill a position left vacant in a Republican district when Donald Trump tapped that person for his administration, won their special election against the Democrat who was probably never going to win no matter how much money was spent.Democrats: OH MY GOD THE REPUBLICANS ARE WINNING WHAT ARE WE DOING WRONG?News: One of the reasons Trump picked so and so for his administration is because the history of the area they’re leaving is so heavily in favor of Republican candidates that it’s a pretty safe bet he wouldn’t be leaving a vacancy that a Democrat may be able to steal.Democrats: I CAN’T BELIEVE WE WERE UNABLE TO STEAL A SEAT THEY’VE HAD FOR YEARS AND YEARS IN AN AREA WHERE MOST OF THE PEOPLE SAY “BOOTSTRAPS” EVEN MORE THAN THEY SAY “I ONLY WATCH FOX NEWS.”News: This really says nothing about the prospects of next year’s midterm elections and the results are pretty similar to 2009 when vacancies left by Obama were filled with Democrats who won in heavily Democratic areas. Congress still flipped in favor of the GOP in 2010 as pushback against the new President.Democrats: WE ARE ALL LITERALLY GOING TO DIE TOMORROW.

Nothing was going to stop her.She’s a normal almost-teenage girl in Utah: She loves to draw and make art. When she grows up, she wants to be a Disney animator. Her favorite bands are Imagine Dragons and Fall Out Boy.On June 22, 2016, one day after her birthday, Savannah came out to her parents as lesbian.Mom had suspicions and knew that day might come.“I looked at her and said, ‘OK, I love you. And I’ll support you no matter what you do,’” said Heather, her mother.The family felt strongly that they didn’t have the right to prevent Savannah from telling her story publicly, including sharing it with CNN, but asked that their hometown and last names be withheld to give them a measure of privacy.After coming out to her parents, Savannah began the process of coming out to her friends and extended family.Six months later, she felt a calling.“I had a feeling like I should come out to the church,” Savannah said shyly. “I came out to all of my family and I just wanted to do something more.”  (cont.) Happy Pride Season indeed! I never *officially* came out at church, but my mama had the church leaders praying that I would be released from my homosexual demons so I guess I didn’t have to. I can’t imagine preparing a testimony and standing up in front of all those people to say “I’m gay, God made me this way, and I’m going to live openly and happily.”On one hand, I don’t see the point in trying to force respect out of a religion that wants you to suppress who you are. I don’t understand wanting to belong to a group that says some intrinsic part of yourself is fundamentally wrong. I pay them dust and keep it moving.But on the other hand, as an atheist I see all Abrahamic religions as fables and parables subject to changing interpretations wholly dependent upon time and evolving traditions in society. I think it makes no sense to say “this is the Word of God….but I’m going to toss the parts that I don’t like because they’re outdated.” Either God told you how to live, or He didn’t, but that’s a discussion for another time.Since church business of any ilk is really none of my business as a lovable heathen with complete disdain for organized religion, I can’t be mad at this lil baby lesbian. The first person to decide “wearing a cotton/polyester blend is fine even though the Bible says it isn’t” is no different from the first homosexual who says “God made me this way and I’m going to enter a same-sex union.” If she wants to be that person who tries to push Mormons toward full acceptance of homosexuals the way the first Christians decided bacon was too delicious to keep avoiding pork like their Jewish parents, then so be it. I’m proud of her bravery and visibility." True link

I was really focused on just this one group of women who were really isolated and weren’t prepared. A lot of slaves had left at that time, so they were really— that emphasized that they were cut off from the world. [Hallie’s] story’s a really interesting story, but it’s a whole other story, so I was really focused on these women.”The casts of Coppola’s six feature films so far — including The Virgin Suicides, Marie Antoinette, and The Bling Ring — have been almost entirely white. But Coppola said she’s more than open to changing that. “I would love to have a more racially diverse cast whenever I can,” she said. “It didn’t work for this story, but of course I’m very open to stories about many different experiences and points of view.”(cont.)I completely understand everything Sofia Coppola is saying.You can’t tell every story in every film. She picked this dynamic of white women isolated from their surroundings and adding Black women to the story would indeed make it twice as long and would’ve absolutely muddled the plot. There’s no way to tackle race within this context without making a completely different movie.Instead of having the only Black character in the movie depicted as a slave, Coppola chose to erase that character. I too am tired of the token character being the maid, the mammy, the slave, the butler, etc. so I understand her thought process.I understand why Beguiled is the movie that it is, but here’s my issue with Sofia Coppola. Don’t say that you’re open to diversity, you’re open to stories of women from different backgrounds, and you’re open to different points of view when you CHOOSE to make movies in this white woman-centric universe.There’s no way to cast The Bling Ring without a roster full of white women because the story is a true story based on a bunch of white women. You could add some more splashes of color to The Virgin Suicides, but again, that’s Detroit in the 1970s – how integrated do you think those friend groups were? The movies she directs do make sense with the casts she chooses, but the fact that she keeps choosing to helm projects for, about, and starring white women is most of the problem.The remainder of the problem lies in the fact that it’s so much harder to get stories from a Black point of view on screen, and making movies in settings where Black people were ever-present but telling the story from a white point of view that ignores all those brown faces is a double slap in the face. You picked a white story in a Black environment (the Confederate South, Detroit) and both your characters and your casting director ignore all the Black folks that come with the setting.Sofia, for all of her talk of wanting to be diverse, keeps going back to white women. She is a white woman. So I understand gravitating to those characters, though I feel it’s your responsibility as an artist to dig deeper than “these characters look like me so I can tell these stories.” But if that’s your mojo, just own it, and let people receive that truth however they may. Don’t pay lip service to change and pretend to be so open to diversity. Show me. Find more stories that speak to you outside of the same thin white woman’s point of view or just own that prejudice."

Guy A invites Girl and Guy B to his apartment for a threesome. Girl has a boyfriend (who wasn’t invited) and Guy B has a girlfriend (who wasn’t invited). At some point, one of the guys (probably Guy B) starts filming and Girl gets upset. Guy A – who lives in the apartment – drives Girl home to Staten Island, leaving Guy B in the apartment alone. Girl tells her boyfriend she was raped, though police say the threesome was consensual. Guy B’s girlfriend receives an anonymous Instagram message threatening Guy B. Something happens in Guy A’s apartment (he wasn’t back home from Staten Island yet) and Guy B stumbles out bleeding and being chased by three men.Guy B dies, Guy A isn’t a suspect, and Girl needs to be locked up as an accessory if she instigated this murder by claiming rape. What’s more likely? That one of the guys raped her during a threesome and she rode all the way to Staten Island with the other even though he didn’t protect her from being raped OR she was so pissed the guy filmed it that she made up a story for her boyfriend to both cover her tracks and make sure he got his ass kicked?I can’t wait to see this play out."
