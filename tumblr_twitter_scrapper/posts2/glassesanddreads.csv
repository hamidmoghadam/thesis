I’m Viridian, a lower-class white intersex trans woman living in Portland, Oregon. In late September I held a fundraiser for my recovery from top surgery which was scheduled for the middle of October. I had met my goal and had planned out very carefully every aspect of how I would spend the money, both leading up to the surgery with preparations and throughout my recovery by covering food and rent. I have been unemployed and wasn’t able to pursue employment with an impending surgery involving a recovery period of several weeks. The money from the fundraiser is basically my lifeline until I’m well and able to go find work. Unfortunately, I caught a virulent strain of strep in late September and after I took antibiotics I developed an incredibly painful condition where a lymph node on my neck got so enlarged that it began pressing on my inner ear and causing massive pain in my jaw, giving me a fever and night sweats. My tonsils also remained irritated and painful throughout this process making it difficult to swallow and eat. I went to the ER, had a CT scan, saw 4 different doctors and finally saw an ENT specialist. I had over 15 blood tests for infectious diseases (all negative) and an incredibly painful biopsy of my lymph node. My primary care doctor forced me to postpone my surgery. The ENT was well convinced that I had Hodgkins Lymphoma and also forced me to postpone my top surgery until he found the root cause of my condition through the results of the biopsy, which turned out to be inconclusive (which is still terrifying to me because I don’t know what’s wrong). At this point in time I’m being told it’s unlikely I have cancer, which is immensely relieving. So because of this horrible mess, my surgery was set back by 2 weeks. I decided to just go for it despite my health issues. In the mean time I tried to live as frugally as possible in order to try to save as much of my recovery fund as I could, but this illness set me back so far that my planning has faltered and I need to ask for help again. My surgery happened on November 1st. I’m currently on my feet and moving but am still in incredible pain and managing it with strong medications. I won’t be able to work for at least another couple of weeks and I’m about to become completely broke. If anyone can help me with just a little bit more to carry me through to finding gainful employment I will immensely grateful!Thank you for your time and patience reading this.

Steven S. DeKnight is directing the film, which will begin production in the fourth quarter of this year, based on the world created by Guillermo del Toro and Travis Beacham. Boyega will play the son of the character played by Idris Elba in the del Toro-directed original film. Universal will release the film worldwide, everywhere but China. The 2013 original grossed $411 million. Thomas Tull, Mary Parent, Jon Jashni, and del Toro will produce the action adventure film along with Boyega and Femi Oguns under their Upper Room Productions shingle. Cale Boyter is executive producer.  The picture is a beach head project for Legendary, under the leadership of Parent, who became Tull’s vice chairman of Worldwide Production after Jashni exited to start his own venture. The principals have confirmed to Deadline they found their man in Boyega. “It is undeniable that with all his talent and natural charm, John stands out amongst today’s generation of young leading men,” said Parent. Said del Toro: “I am very proud and happy to welcome John into a fantastic sandbox. The Pacific Rim universe will be reinforced with him as a leading man as it continues to be a multicultural, multi-layered world. ‘The World saving the world’ was our goal and I couldn’t think of a better man for the job.”      " False link
