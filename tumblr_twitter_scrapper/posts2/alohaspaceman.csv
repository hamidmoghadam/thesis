I’m back now and didn’t want to let any more time go by without reaching out. By now many of you have heard the news, and I’m sad to say it is true. I will not be returning to Hawaii Five-0 when production starts next week. Though I made myselfavailable to come back, CBS and I weren’t able to agree to terms on a new contract, so I made the difficult choice not to continue. As sad as it feels to say goodbye, what I feel most is gratitude. I am so deeply thankful to our crew, writers and everyone associated with the show – and especially the cast, who have been nothing but supportive through this entire process. They and the crew have been my second family for seven years and I wish them nothing but success for season 8 - and beyond.I also want to say to thank you to Peter Lenkov, Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci and everyone at CBS. I will always be grateful for their faith in me to bring Chin Ho Kelly to life. As an Asian American actor, I know first-hand how difficult it is to find opportunities at all, let alone play a well developed, three dimensional character like Chin Ho. I will miss him sincerely. What made him even more special is that he was a representative of a place my family and I so dearly love. It has been nothing short of an honor to be able to showcase the beauty and people of Hawaii every week, and I couldn’t be prouder to call these islands home. To my local community, mahalo nui loa.Finally, I want to thank all of you, the fans. I’ve read your messages and I can’t tell you how much they’ve meant to me. I never, ever forget that YOU are the reason Hawaii Five-0 is the success that it is, and interacting with you online and in person around the world(!) has been one of the greatest joys of this entire experience. I’m so sorry we won’t be continuing this journey together. I’ll end by saying that though transitions can be difficult, I encourage us all to look beyond the disappointment of this moment to the bigger picture. The path to equality is rarely easy. But I hope you can be excited for the future. I am. 5-0 continues on after one of its strongest seasons. I’ve got new acting projects on the horizon, and as a producer, my company, 3AD, has its first show, THE GOOD DOCTOR, set to air this fall on ABC. I hope you’ll tune in. There’s a lot to look forward to and I’ll be sure to share it with you. In the meantime, Aloha, thank you and Happy Independence Day!-DDK" True text

While we could not reach an agreement, we  part ways with tremendous respect for their talents on screen, as well  as their roles as ambassadors for the show off screen, and with hopes to  work with them again in the near future.” Kim lifted the veil on the dealmaking process with a Facebook post Wednesday  asserting  that he was not able to come to terms with CBS on a deal and that “the  path to equality is rarely easy.” It’s understood that Kim and Park  sought pay parity with the series’ lead actors, Alex O’Loughlin and  Scott Caan. The fact that Kim and Park are of Asian descent while  O’Loughlin and Caan are Caucasian added an inevitable racial component  to the situation at a time of heightened focus on diversity at all  levels of the entertainment industry. CBS executives were said to be  troubled by the suggestion from media coverage of Kim and Park’s  departures that race played a role in a business negotiation.Industry sources said O’Loughlin and Caan  are making about $200,000 per episode apiece for the upcoming eighth  season of the show, produced by CBS Television Studios. A source close  to the situation said CBS’ last per-episode salary offer to Kim was  about $5,000 apart from the two lead actors, and CBS offered to set a  new overall deal with Kim’s 3AD production banner. However, sources  close to Kim said the differential was more significant.The dispute on the difference in  compensation levels may hinge on the fact that O’Loughlin and Caan have a  small share of the backend profits of the show. “Hawaii Five-0”  commanded a lucrative $2 million-per-episode cable syndication deal with  TNT in 2011, although the show turned out to be a lackluster performer  for the cabler. It remains a successful property for CBS in  international markets — all of which means O’Loughlin and Caan’s profit  participation stakes probably plump up their take-home pay  considerably. Park, meanwhile, was said to have sought a  deal for less than half of a full season’s worth of episodes, which  would have been a financially challenging prospect for the network at  the salary that she sought. “Hawaii Five-0” delivered some 25 episodes  in its most recent season.Sources close to the situation noted that Kim and Park did not  negotiate as a unit in their discussions with CBS. The final offer for  Park was lower than that for Kim, according to a source.From Kim and Park’s perspective, it’s clear that the lack of pay  parity with O’Loughlin and Caan after seven seasons as central  characters was a deal-breaker. Kim is also revving up his activity as a  producer. His 3AD banner landed a new medical drama series on ABC for  the coming season, “The Good Doctor,” starring Freddie Highmore.From CBS’ perspective, Kim and Park remained supporting players and  there was a need to adhere, for precedent’s sake, to a traditional  differential between the job categories. The backend stakes that  O’Loughlin and Caan commanded reflect the leverage that the two actors  brought to the show when it was assembled in the 2009-2010 development  cycle.O’Loughlin and Caan have one more season to go on their contract with the show."

Grace’s presence gave ‘Hawaii Five-0’ a beauty and serenity to each episode. She was the consummate collaborator, helping build her character from day 1.

They’ve helped us build an exciting new Hawaii Five-0, and we wish them all the best and much success in their next chapters. Mahalo and a hui hou…”Kim and Park have both been cast members on “Hawaii Five-O” alongside O’Loughlin and Caan since CBS premiered a rebooted version of the classic television cop show in 2010.The “Hawaii Five-0” changes represent the latest in a series of cast overhauls at returning broadcast dramas.

And they really brought it for the 100th episode celebration at ATX Television Festival on Sunday.Original cast members Patrick J. Adams, Gabriel Macht, Meghan Markle, Rick Hoffman, Gina Torres, and Sarah Rafferty — along with creator Aaron Korsh, guests Abigail Spencer and Nick Wechsler, and the moderator, EW’s own Robyn Ross — came together for a lively table read of the pilot episode, but, in true Suits fashion, they didn’t exactly play it straight. The actors put on ridiculous accents and generally behaved about as playfully as you’d expect for a well-bonded cast that’s been together for seven seasons.“Sometimes work can feel like work, but this felt like play the whole time,” Adams said of shooting the pilot in 2011.Throughout the reading, the actors mocked one another (particularly Macht’s pronunciation of the word “harassment”) and shared surprise at various lines they’d forgotten.“I’m so nervous,” Markle admitted as she read the scene where Rachel tells Mike about her struggles with the LSAT. “Oh my god, I remember this. I think this is my audition scene.”“We had that group email the other day, and I was saying we’d all been to the same corporate housing so on top of working together, we were all living together,” Markle recalled. “Which makes a whole different dynamic, I think. It just became this family right out of the gate.”“That was really sweet,” Torres added. “There was an instant level of comfort and there was chemistry that’s only grown. When you have that, it’s safe to play, it’s safe to explore, it’s safe to take chances.”Watch the special 100th episode celebration montage, featuring several of the show’s signature one-liners, below.Later, at Rafferty’s urging, Markle showed off the adorable “Bewitched twitch” she can do with her nose.“This is like winning not only one lottery ticket, but three,” Hoffman said of the experience of celebrating 100 episodes. “All I have to say is thank you and I’ll never forget it.”But the chatter wasn’t only about looking back. The cast offered some clues about what to expect in season 7.When asked about that Darvey cliffhanger moment — where Donna told Harvey she wants more — Rafferty explained, “I think she meant everything everyone in this room is thinking she meant. … I think she’s in-process.”As for whether or not Torres will be returning to the series following her surprise appearance in the season 6 finale, the actress teased, “I wedged that door open on my way out.”Suits season 7 kicks off at 9 p.m. ET on July 12 on USA.

Don’t be surprised if this new arrival eventually makes her way onto McGarrett’s team.  " True link

Chris Yost (Thor: The Dark World, Thor: Ragnarok), who started his career writing for comic book-based animated series before segueing to features, will pen the adaptation.  The space Western story follows Spike Spiegel and his rag-tag crew of  bounty hunters, or Cowboys, as they try to capture the galaxy’s worst  criminals and survive the unexpected dangers they encounter throughout  space, sometimes saving the world in the process but always leaving  millions in damages.  Cowboy Bebop, considered one of the best anime series of all  time, produced 26 episodes, which aired in Japan from 1998-1999. It has  done well internationally, garnering several anime and science fiction  awards, and is credited with helping to introduce anime to a new wave of  Western viewers. In the U.S., it aired on Adult Swim.“We are excited to work with Sunrise in bringing this beloved anime  to the U.S. and global marketplace as a live-action series,” said  Adelstein. “The animated version has long resonated with audiences  worldwide, and with the continued, ever growing, popularity of anime, we  believe a live action version will have an incredible impact today.”Tomorrow Studios has another U.S. TV adaptation of a popular Asian genre title, South Korean movie Snowpiercer, which has a pilot order at TNT."

UK authorities didn’t act. I repeat: Not once, not twice, not thrice. Five times. They were alerted five times by the Muslim community around the bomber and were ignored.  Specifically, two of his close friends reported him after he made comments praising suicide bombers. Two of his friends. And it was ignored. And instantly after this happened and the bomber was identified as a Muslim, people began saying how ‘Muslims need to take greater steps to confront extremism in their own communities’, even though a mosque literally banned him, reported him and two of his friends did the same when he began expressing extremist sentiment. Muslims can’t win even when they do the right thing. Even worse, they also had info from other counter-terrorist agencies that he had ties with groups in Lybia and that his father had them as well. They did nothing. " False link
