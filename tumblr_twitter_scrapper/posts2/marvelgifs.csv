Jones, who plays Ser Loras Tyrell on the HBO hit, will take on the role of the martial arts master in the upcoming Netflix series, EW has learned. Iron Fist is set to be the fourth Marvel and Netflix collaboration, following Daredevil, Jessica Jones, and the forthcoming Luke Cage. Scott Buck (Dexter) has been tapped as showrunner. Marvel plans to eventually unite all its heroes in a series called The Defenders. In the comics, Iron Fist is Daniel Rand, who at age of 9 travels with his family from New York to a lost mystical city called K’un-L’un. After some tragic twists of fate, Rand is adopted by the city’s ruler and taught advanced martial arts and the mystical power of the Iron Fist. As an adult, Rand returns to his native New York and begins a career as a superhero. Some fans have urged Marvel to cast an Asian actor in the lead role, even though the character is white in the comics. Others countered that picking an Asian actor simply because the hero’s ability is martial arts would be a stereotypical move. Jones’ casting was first floated as a rumor on That Hashtag Show. Jones, who also appeared in British shows such as Hollyoaks, is next set to appear in season 6 of Thrones, while Marvel’s next premiere is the eagerly awaited return of Daredevil on March 18. Netflix and Marvel had no comment. " False text

Amongst the no-stone-left-unturned coverage in the Civil War cover story is a first look proper at Frank Grillo’s Crossbones. We’ve had Red Skull, now meet the other half of HYDRA’s un-jolly roger.    A reminder that HYDRA is still out there and up to no good, Crossbones is the superhero incarnation of Brock Rumlow. Part of a sleeper cell lurking within SHIELD in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, he’s now officially up, showered, breakfasted and is ready to unleash hell on Cap and co. We’d expect that, beneath the medieval-looking armour, he’s bearing the scars of Winter Soldier’s violent climax. How, and when, he resurfaces remains to be seen.  Less ambiguous is the role of Elizabeth Olsen’s Scarlet Witch. Shorn of her psychic twin, Quicksilver, she’s throwing her chips in with Cap (Chris Evans), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Bucky (Sebastian Stan), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). It’ll set her against her comic-book paramour, the Vision (Paul Bettany), a cohort of Tony Stark’s (Robert Downey Jr.) in the movie.Last, but definitely not least, is a closer look at the main event: Rogers versus Stark, Cap versus Iron Man, rebel against enforcer. The two old colleagues always had a tense friendship but thanks to Stark’s support for the superhero registration legislation, it’s fracturing beyond repair.For much more on Captain America: Civil War) pick up the new issue of Empire on Thursday, February 25.

During the fight, Crossbones tosses a magnetic explosive at Cap’s shield, and the hero throws it into the air so that the explosion avoids the crowd.   Crossbones removes his mask and reveals his scarred face, turning to Cap and saying, “He remembered you, you know. Your little pal Bucky.” The footage then cut to the scene from the credits of Ant-Man, where Cap and Falcon are talking to Bucky. Bucky tells Cap that he remembers his mom’s name was Sarah, and that he used to stuff newspapers in his shoes. Cap smiles, knowing that some trace of his old friend is still in there. We then see General Ross (William Hurt, reprising his role from Edward Norton’s Incredible Hulk) telling Cap how the country owes him an impossible debt, but that for some he’s not a hero now but a vigilante. Cut to shots of Cap and Tony Stark talking about what comes next. Tony talks about how they’re operating with oversight so how does that make them different from villains? “That’s what this is about to you? Protection?” says Cap. While continuing to argue, Iron Man tells Cap, “Sometimes I want to punch you in your perfect teeth.” The footage then rolls into quick shots of the heroes delivering some pretty great lines. “In this job, you try to save everybody you can. Sometimes that doesn’t mean everybody,” say a stoic Captain America. We see a quick shot of Black Panther, but no sign of Spider-Man. Black Widow and Hawkeye, caught on opposite sides of the Civil War, are about to fight. “We’re still friends right?” Black Widow asks. “Depends on how hard you hit me,” Hawkeye replies.The footage ended with Hawkeye opening a van, revealing Paul Rudd’s Ant-Man. He’s absolutely starstruck by Captain America. He’s shaking as he meets him, and fumbles the greeting. “You know a lot of super people, so thanks for thinking of me.”[synopsis found on IGN]" True text

Each of the company’s 14 films over the past eight years has opened in first place at the domestic box office, and they’ve brought in more than $10 billion globally. That success is a boon for Disney CEO Bob Iger, who led the $4 billion acquisition of the comic-book empire Marvel Entertainment in 2009.But it’s Feige who is credited with Marvel’s signature style — a blend of humor, optimism, and spectacle that has attracted legions of fans around the world. And he’s had great success in elevating lesser-known characters, like Iron Man, Captain America, and Doctor Strange, into big-screen brands.Feige spoke with Variety about Marvel’s plans to promote diversity, upcoming projects, and what it is that makes him anxious.How much freedom do you give actors to put their own imprint on characters?They have a lot of freedom to take what has made the characters as popular [as they’ve been] for as long as they’ve appeared in the comics, and evolve it and grow it. Think about what you saw Benedict [Cumberbatch] do in “Doctor Strange” — he embodied that character and made it his own. That’s similar to what Robert Downey Jr. did by molding and shaping and turning [Iron Man] into something even more contemporary and relatable.Would you recast your biggest superheroes with other actors if, say, Robert Downey Jr. or Chris Evans decide they want to move on? Luckily we don’t have to make that decision anytime soon. There are a lot of movies that everyone is signed on for, and we get to enjoy them for a long time. Robert Downey Jr. is Iron Man, and right now I can’t envision anyone else. Chris Evans has embodied Captain America as well as any actor has ever embodied an iconic pop-culture figure like that. I go back to Chris Reeve as Superman as the gold standard, and I think Evans is right there. I couldn’t imagine anybody else.But you also look to history: We have a new Spider-Man right now who was in our “Civil War” film and is in “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” and the audience has embraced it. And you can look to Sherlock Holmes, James Bond, and Batman as characters that last longer than any one actor playing them. There’s a precedent for it in other franchises that suggests it’s possible. But right now I don’t want to think about it and don’t need to think about it.“Spider-Man: Homecoming” is backed by Sony but produced by Marvel. How will that change this version of “Spider-Man”?It takes place inside the cinematic universe that we have built across 14 films. In the previous films, Spider-Man was the only superhero who existed in that world. In the comic books, Spider-Man always existed in a world where the Avengers existed, and Iron Man existed, and the Hulk would run through the streets, and Captain America had been thawed out of the ice. In the film, he’s a young kid who has to be home at curfew so his Aunt May doesn’t get worried, and go to school, and do his homework. That’s in contrast to Tony Stark’s life or Stephen Strange’s.Fox controls the film rights to “The X-Men” and “The Fantastic Four.” Could you partner with them on a movie as you did with Sony?It’s an impossibility at this juncture. We certainly have enough films to keep us busy for a number of lifetimes.There are more comic-book movies being made, with DC trying to develop its own cinematic universe. Are you worried about the competition?What other people are adapting from the comics medium, I watch with as much interest as I do any other movies. Because I’m a fan, and I want to see what other people are doing in the world.I’ve always believed in expanding the definition of what a Marvel Studios movie could be. We try to keep audiences coming back in greater numbers by doing the unexpected and not simply following a pattern or a mold or a formula.There’s a lot of discussion of inclusion in the business. Do you believe Marvel has a role to play in creating opportunities for people of color, women, and other groups?Absolutely. The comics have always been progressive. They’ve showcased all sorts of different cultures and ethnicities. And we want to stay true to that. When you look at “Black Panther” — when you look at “Captain Marvel,” which will be Brie Larson in the title role — it is a very important thing for us to have diversity both in front of the camera and behind the camera.Is finding a female director for “Captain Marvel” a priority? It is. Having a female director at the helm to tell the story of a woman who is also our most powerful hero by far is very important to us.What makes her so powerful?If you had the collector cards of the Marvel characters and you could see the power levels, she would be off the charts compared to anyone that we’ve previously introduced in a film.Why was Brie Larson the right fit?With Captain Marvel, who has powers that approach a level that we haven’t seen before in our films, you need to counter- balance that by finding somebody who is also very human and very relatable and can get into a groove with the audience, where they’re willing to see her fly through the sun and punch a moon away from a spacecraft. At the same time, we need her to land and have relatable flaws.Brie is a person you’re going to want to go on this journey with, just like Benedict or Robert or Chris Pratt.You’ve had a string of hits Do you ever greenlight a film about a character that may be interesting but isn’t well-known, and get seized by anxiety that the audience won’t show up?I feel anxiety about every scene and every character in every movie we’ve ever made. That’s why when you sit down for your first test screening, you’re nauseated. It would be hubris to think people are going to love everything you put in front of them." True link

It looks like the search for our big screen adaptation of Carol Danvers have finally come to an end, and now we have an Academy Award-winning actress playing her. Today at San Diego Comic-Con, Marvel confirmed that Brie Larson is set to portray Captain Marvel during their Hall H presentation.It seemed plausible that Larson would have made her inevitable appearance if her casting as recently reported were truly official, knowing that she was present at the Warner Bros. Hall H presentation alongside Loki himself, Tom Hiddleston in promotion for their upcoming film, Kong: Skull Island. Brie Larson won an Oscar this year for her remarkable performance in Room, and adding her to the Marvel Cinematic Universe is only indicative of the top-level performers the studio is aiming for to lead this new phase of movies.I have been a big fan of Brie Larson since her performance in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World and to have seen her break out over the years always made me smile. As someone who loves following up-and-coming actors/actresses make it big, I am more than happy that she was Marvel’s pick to play Captain Marvel. I can only imagine what her dynamic alongside Captain America, Iron Man and the rest of the Avengers will be like.What do you guys think of this casting news?
