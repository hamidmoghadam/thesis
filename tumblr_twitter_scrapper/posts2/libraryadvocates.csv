Imogen Foxell tells her story. I’m an Oxford-based lexicographer who moonlights as an artist. Last Christmas I spent a lot of time and effort illustrating scenes from Mansfield Park for a Folio Society competition, which I ultimately didn’t win. But during this period, my exhausted mind was filled with Mansfield Park, and I found myself having a series of vivid dreams:    Fanny Price’s secret identity as a killer robot, her face-off with a dragon, her transformation into Mr. Hyde.   Having completed my competition entry, I let off steam by doing a quick sketch of my dreams on the giant blackboard that, I think, the previous residents of my old flat had ‘acquired’ from a pub. A little while later, I applied to an excellent workshop at the Bodleian on medieval book art, and this is when Maddy Slaven, the libraries’ head of exhibitions, saw my Mansfield Park blackboard blog. Brilliantly, it was just the thing she was looking to add to one of the cases. Not so brilliantly, the original blackboard picture was no more; I rub them out every week to make space for another illustration. But I was able to recreate the picture, and now… it’s in the exhibition, and there are even postcards and prints in the gift shop! And as a huge Jane Austen fan, it’s just remarkable to see my picture in the same room as her writing desk and original manuscripts. Which Jane Austen? at the Bodleian Libraries’ Weston Library will be open seven days a week until 29 October. You will find Imogen on Twitter. " False text

This proposed budget eliminates funding for IMLS, a federal agency that provides critical support for Native American, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian libraries across the country. The American Indian Library Association (AILA) is calling on all tribal librarians, archivists, community members, and the public to share stories to help us fight for continued federal funding for the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). We are seeking short stories from your communities to demonstrate the role tribal libraries play in supporting culture, community, and education. Use this form to share your story and upload any photos to accompany your story. Funding for Native American libraries and information services has been a long struggle for those committed to the development of libraries in Indian Country since the 1970s. Strong and consistent advocacy from American Indian leaders helped to secure federal funding that would be used by tribes, for tribes, to meet their library and information needs. Vine Deloria, Jr. and other American Indian leaders have reminded us that the federal support of tribal library services is a function of Indian treaty rights as tribes sacrificed land and resources in exchange for educational services.  Our communities stand to lose millions in federal support for childhood literacy, language revitalization, digital infrastructure, college and vocational prep, job-seeking support, and so much more. In some cases, IMLS provides the only consistent source of library funding. In a very real way, the defunding of IMLS could mean the loss of tribal libraries. " False text
