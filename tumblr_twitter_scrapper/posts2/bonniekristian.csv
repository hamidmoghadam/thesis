As you hopefully recall, I’m working on my first book right now. It’s    very accessible theology project exploring the breadth of Christian orthodoxy and orthopraxy, both historically and in the church today—which basically means it’s designed to answer the question, “What’s the deal with all these different kinds of Christians?”Part of the book will be a series of brief interviews introducing readers to Christians whose commitment to follow Jesus looks significantly different from that of the average American churchgoer. The concept is not just people with unusual theologies (that’s more the territory of other parts of the book), but significantly unusual daily expressions or habits of their faith. That’s inevitably something of an arbitrary distinction, I realize, but it’s why a Messianic Jew, a member of a common purse community, a Franciscan brother, and a racial reconciler all make the cut, but a Calvinist or a Baptist wouldn’t.So this is where you come in: What type(s) of Christian would you like to see in these interviews? What sort of Christian have you looked at and wondered, “What are they about and why do they live like that?”—but never had the opportunity to ask?I’m aiming for 17-19 interviews, currently have about 15 planned, and would love to get your suggestions to fill in those last few spots. Maybe there’s some category that just happens to be familiar to me but is super unfamiliar to most people? You don’t have to suggest a specific person—I’ll do that legwork—just a general category.So, whatcha got?" True text

There was no 24-hour, days long cable news barrage about it. There were no hashtags, social media campaigns or protests. The pain was just as real for those suffering, but the coverage and popular reaction were almost nonexistent.So many of those outraged right now — and rightly — generally liked Obama. They trusted him. Now, similarly, Trump supporters will defend this president’s actions, no matter how much harm he causes, because they like and trust him too.But shouldn’t other people’s pain come before partisanship? Should Alexander Gutierrez Garcia and Abu Hassan matter less than Hameed Khalid Darweesh?Shouldn’t lending our moral support or outrage be based on something more than merely what presidents we like?” — Jack Hunter, “Where was the outrage where Obama was hurting innocent foreigners?”“Of the seven countries in Trump’s ban, the U.S. military is operating in all but one of them. The U.S. knocked over the governments of Iraq and Libya, creating instability and sectarian conflict across the region, including in Syria. The U.S. now bombs all three of those countries in an attempt to manage their internal political turmoil. In Yemen, the U.S. is a party to Saudi Arabia’s unjust and hopeless war there, providing weapons, logistical support, and even help with refueling airplanes and targeting. The U.S. is even conducting a shadow war in Somalia. Surely if Muslim lives matter, they matter when they are being bombed by our planes, or when their country is being ripped apart by our proxies, or starved by the blockades we assist. These policies wreck many more Muslim lives than Trump’s executive order.” — Michael Brendan Dougherty, “Where was the liberal uproar over Obama’s Middle East wars?”On Friday, President Trump signed his executive order suspending immigration and travel from six countries (Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Libya, Yemen, and Somalia) for three months and one country (Syria) indefinitely. The same order also suspended all refugee admissions to the United States for four months (again, Syria indefinitely) and indicated that minority religious groups in these nations (all of which are Muslim-majority) would be given preference when refugee admissions resumed.Since then, uproar over Trump’s order has been incessant, and rightly so. This order is inhumane, irrational, and ill-conceived. It egregiously flouts the rule of law and, particularly for those who were detained and/or turned away from U.S. airports over the weekend despite their possession of legitimate travel papers, is a denial of due process. And whatever Trump says about this not being the “Muslim ban” — honestly, that suggests to me the worrying possibility that he has some other, more onerous ban in mind — the president’s own comments, the comments of his allies, and the order’s preference for religious minorities in majority-Muslim countries all say otherwise.As thousands of protesters have amassed at airports and in Washington, many civil libertarians have noted that these newly minted political activists were largely silent during abuses of the Obama administration which, while not identical to this Trump order, deserve to be placed in the same general category. Above I’ve quoted two examples of this argument, one from my editor at Rare, Jack Hunter, and one from my colleague at The Week, Michael Brendan Dougherty.Both are dead on, and their point about consistency over partisanship cannot be heard enough.However, I’ve also increasingly run across criticisms of those using executive order outrage to make the consistency argument. We civil libertarians might be technically right, the critics contend, but we’re being unnecessarily divisive at a time when unity against Trumpian power grabs and constitutional breaches should be our top and single political priority.Here’s the thing: In some cases, what’s going on is more about schadenfreude than a principled case for consistency. And schadenfreude, not to put to fine a point on it, is a jerk move. In fact, I feel pretty comfortable saying it’s a sin. A vice. There’s a lot of talk about decency right now, and decent people do not rejoice in their enemies’ misfortune, even when they are political enemies whose anger we believe to be hypocritical and short-sighted.But I don’t think what Jack and MBD are doing in the quotes above is schadenfreude. Rather, as Rep. Justin Amash — one of a very short list of Republicans who have publicly opposed Trump’s order — wrote on Twitter, “Admitting that both parties routinely ignore the Constitution, reject the Rule of Law, and erode liberty is the first step to recovery…If you can’t accept both sides have been disastrous, then don’t expect things to get better.”  So to all the people who are protesting civil liberties abuses for the first time right now: Thank you. Keep doing what you’re doing. I hope to see your outrage extended to include the state of the war on terror more broadly. I hope your mobilization makes the protests of the invasion of Iraq back in 2003 look like child’s play.But — and this is key — I also hope you remember that a lot of what Trump is doing is not as new as it feels, and that the groundwork that made much of this possible was laid by a guy you may have liked. In short, remember that the presidency needs institutional, not individual, change. Its power needs to be massively curtailed, even when guys we might like more than Trump are in office. If we can’t get a consistent perspective that acknowledges everything that happened before Jan. 20, 2017, all the protests may as well shut down now.A version of this piece is published here at Rare."

Trump’s treatment of women, the 24-year-old continued, “doesn’t impact border security, national security, trade, jobs, spending or anything else that impacts your daily life. No! But same cannot be said about Hillary’s dream of open trade and open borders.” […]  Falwell Jr. argues, like Lahren, that Trump’s good policies outweigh his bad character. “Our country is gonna suffer if we get sidetracked on these rabbit trails about is this person a good person, is that person a good person,” he has said. “It’s not about that. It’s about what are their positions on the issues.”  I don’t want to overgeneralize here, or to suggest this is purely a power-motivated calculation (though in many cases I believe that’s the primary, if subconscious, motivation). Nevertheless, it has happened, and it is not a minor change.I’ve argued that as much as policy matters, character matters too—and, in fact, a president of poor character would probably lack the integrity to stick to their good promises or, if they didn’t outright abandon the principles of their campaign, they’d lack the discipline to push their ideas through the morass of Washington.Today, I was thinking about this subject again because I read this list of 51 things Trump has said about women. It’s awful. Even if you excuse the more explicit stuff as “locker room talk” (I don’t, but say you do), the less explicit is just as bad. For instance: “Women have one of the great acts of all time” — as if half the human race is solely engaged in manipulation at every moment, accomplishing everything we do through deception rather than ability.Now, one of the unusual things of being a libertarian is that we have fairly few (or, for some, zero) politicians with whom we’re really willing to throw in our lot. It’s so unusual to have someone who closely aligns with our views that the feeling of significant enthusiasm over a public figure is mostly foreign.  So here’s my question and the point of this post: Imagine a candidate who is 100% aligned with your views and also has Trump’s exact personal character. For the sake of argument, because it is policy-adjacent, let’s say the hypothetical candidate doesn’t have Trump’s personal history of eminent domain obsession and abuse, bankruptcy, etc. (I realize some will want to argue Trump’s specific character flaws are incompatible with their political views, but try to imagine an analogous situation for the sake of the thought experiment.)Would you support them?"

They were fighting for equal rights of political expression, and intentional abstention from the electoral process fits that bill as well as voting does.Voting is not inherently moral. More than once the ballot box has been the means of a dictator’s rise.Abstention is not inherently apathetic. In fact, there have even been abstention campaigns in which people withheld votes to indict a political system whose flaws extended well past a single party or candidate.Voting for a third-party or write-in candidate or writing something like “none of the above” is not necessarily more moral or effective than total abstention. Yes, abstention can be misinterpreted as apathy, but is does not risk misinterpretation as acceptance of the whole electoral structure, which those other options do chance.Refusing to vote for one candidate does not mean supporting their opponent. That is a logically fallacious guilt trip.Voting is not the solution to our problems. That’s not to say it never helps, but politics is no panacea, and there are many problems it can’t fix.  Voting can become an excuse for avoiding work to actually address those problems. More on that here.Look, I know the importance of voting (and specifically, voting for a viable candidate) is drilled into us from kindergarten on up by people we admire and respect. That voting is an obligation and refusing to vote at the very least a sign of poor character is well-ingrained in the American psyche. There are good and understandable historical reasons why voting so revered in the United States, but those reasons do not make these assumptions correct. If there was ever a time for critical thinking about whether and how to vote, 2016 is it. I encourage you to use that opportunity well. Maybe you’ll still end up voting—maybe even for one of the major party choices. Fine. But don’t do it on autopilot. Don’t do it because you think it’s your duty as an American to pull the lever for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. Nothing could be farther from the truth." True text

And yet, he is still dead, executed roadside by a police officer who panicked, and then failed by a justice system that doesn’t hold cops accountable for a demonstrably systemic pattern of gross misconduct.Yanez was acquitted of all charges, deemed “not guilty” of manslaughter in the second degree and reckless discharge of a firearm. I specify those charges because when one of the jurors spoke out after the case, he suggested the verdict was the only possible conclusion given the “way the law is written.” That made me wonder if he was right, if the jury’s hand was forced by legislation poorly developed or applied.So I tracked down the relevant Minnesota laws and the instructions the jury received before beginning their deliberations, and there’s just no escaping it: This wasn’t about the “way the law was written;” it was about who was subject to the charges.Yanez was freed, as Daniel Payne writes at The Federalist, because Americans “have a queer aversion to convicting police officers when they quite obviously break the law,” a “deeply dysfunctional and unhealthy attitude about what constitutes acceptable police behavior,” and a “profoundly stupid and misguided deferential attitude toward law enforcement.”Read the rest here."

Calling the cops is not guaranteed to be best for our block.After all, is the very real risk of undue escalation—even violence—worth it to turn off music? To catch the originator of that weed smell? To address a housing code violation, like unshoveled sidewalks or trash strewn across the alley? Again and again my answer has been “no.”It’s the same answer recommended by a Facebook post making the rounds here in the Twin Cities since the recent police shooting of Philando Castile. “White people,” it reads, “stop calling the police on your black neighbors because you think their music is too loud. Stop calling the police on your black neighbors because you think they’re loitering. Stop calling the police on your black neighbors because they’re hanging out in their car.”In short, stop calling the police for all kinds of petty, nonviolent irritations, because “These actions don’t affect your safety, your fear of them is irrational, and your call could get [your neighbors] killed.”Castile’s death isn’t the only evidence that a routine police visit over a trivial offense could turn dangerous. Police misconduct is a systemic issue nationwide; even while violent crime rates are historically low, perverse institutional incentives likeovercriminalization, police militarization and escalation, racial bias, and policing for profit foster too-frequent abuses of power."

Independent observers have long counted far more strikes than Washington admits, and this research is confirmation of that disparity, not entirely new information. Here are the numbers from the report’s executive summary:  The U.S. government has admitted that it killed between 2,867–3,138 people between 2009–2016, in an estimated 526 strikes in areas the government deemed outside of “active hostilities.” Our research reveals that the government has acknowledged approximately 153 strikes, about 20 per cent of the more than 700 reported strikes since 2002. For strikes between 2009 and 2016, independent organizations have recorded an estimated minimum of almost 400 civilian casualties in Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen, while the government claims that the number is less than 120.Now, as the Intercept piece linked above notes, the strike rate is escalating substantially. The lack of transparency was bad enough under President Obama; at the rate the Trump administration is using drones, it is even worse:Over the past decade, the United States has claimed broad authority to carry out drone strikes across the world, even in places far from the battlefield. Under President Barack Obama, the U.S. acknowledged killing between 2,867 and 3,138 people in strikes that took place in countries like Somalia, Yemen, and Pakistan.Although in the waning days of his presidency, Obama took some steps to improve transparency about drone strikes, including providing the total estimated death toll, a new report by the Columbia Law School Human Rights Clinic and the Sana’a Center for Strategic Studies says that the U.S. is still lagging in providing a full accounting of its drone program. Among other failures, the report, titled “Out of the Shadows: Recommendations to Advance Transparency in the Use of Lethal Force,” says that the U.S. has only acknowledged approximately 20 percent of its reported drone strikes — failing to claim responsibility or provide details in the vast majority of cases.Meanwhile, the drone program is intensifying. Since President Donald Trump took office earlier this year, the rate of drone strikes per month has increased by almost four times Obama’s average. Yemen in particular has been a target of many of these operations, with between nine and 11 strikes hitting the country this year, along with 81 other covert attacks by U.S. forces, according to statistics compiled by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism."

It’s an opioid epidemic, not a pot epidemic. Abusing heroin is not similar to using medical marijuana to alleviate your PTSD, cancer, or epilepsy. Not even close.Second, there’s good evidence that legalizing medical marijuana is one of our best tools to stop the very “historic drug epidemic” Sessions cites. States in which medical marijuana is legal see markedly lower rates of opioid abuse and overdose. Reviving federal prosecution of medical marijuana providers is precisely the wrong thing to do to fight the opioid epidemic.And third, legal medical marijuana providers are not fostering violent crime. Full stop.These are legitimate businesses. They have storefronts and logos and tax bills. In most states they are tightly regulated. They are certainly not buying their product from “transnational drug organizations and dangerous drug traffickers who threaten American lives.”They are not doing anything violent or illegal because legalization means there’s absolutely no need. Prohibition, not legalization, is what leads to violent crime." True link

He wasn’t exonerated or released on parole. He wasn’t pardoned by the governor. No one else has confessed to the murder for which he was convicted in 1977. No DNA cleared him. No witness recanted. No celebrities pleaded his cause.Hartfield was freed from prison because Texas finally gave up trying to find a valid reason to keep him there. He had waited 35 years between trials without a conviction, a prisoner simply forgotten for decades in the state’s massive justice system.He was supposed to get a new trial in 1980 after an appeals court reversed his conviction and death sentence because of a flaw during jury selection. Instead, after a series of misunderstandings and miscommunications by lawyers, judges, and jailers — who all thought Hartfield was someone else’s problem — he never got that second day in court. If it were not for a fellow prisoner and the public defenders who eventually discovered the mistake, the 61-year-old intellectually disabled man likely would have died alone in his cell, his story as lost as he was."

An excerpt:Trump has plenty of detractors, yes. At a popular level, we saw the Women’s March, the Science March, the Earth Day March, and the Tax Day March — all very impressive and more or less explicitly born out of anti-Trump fervor. Yet the harsh reality is these movements’ concrete accomplishments in cutting back executive overgrowth is nada. Marching has not taken away President Trump’s ability to misuse all the power shortsighted partisans of the recent past entrusted to Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama (and, now, their orange successor). Marching has not erected institutional strongholds built to weather any presidential storm. […]Meaningful structural change could be had, if we wanted it, though the process would be difficult and often counterintuitive given the extent to which presidential glorification has become our cultural norm.Read the rest here."

A third man died of dehydration over the period of a week as guards ignored his pleas for help, allowing him to wither and suffer. The latter death was ruled a homicide.And in December 2016, a mother forced to give birth on the floor of her cell watched her newborn suffer and die without care, according to another federal lawsuit against the department.

But unlike Tammany Hall, he doesn’t exactly deliver. Thus, for example, his religious liberty executive order from last week. This EO changed just about nothing—seriously, it’s so toothless the ACLU decided not to bother challenging it in court.That Trump has done nothing of substance to enhance freedom of conscience protections hasn’t stopped evangelical leaders from singing his praises, because he continues to make them feel heard. Trump promised to “fight for” evangelicals, to look out for him the way Tammany Hall looked out for immigrants. That feeling of protection and access is enough for Liberty University’s Jerry Falwell Jr. to declare Trump the “dream president.”To put my cards on the table, I was raised among the very white evangelicals who are now so enthusiastic about Trump. I do not share any of their enthusiasm because of the president’s policy and personal character alike.And even though I understand why Trump’s Tammany-style promises appeal, I am disappointed and worried to see my fellow Christians putting their “trust in princes,” as Psalm 146 phrases it, “in human beings, who cannot save.”Donald Trump is not savior of the American church, and it is troubling how many of my fellow Christians are so eager to rely on his (politically impotent) blessings. My own disagreement aside, it’s one thing to be a Christian who likes Trump’s policies. It’s another to make him the onus of your security, hope, and faith in a good future. For Christians, that seat should already be taken." True link

It gives officers strategies to more calmly deal with people who are experiencing mental and emotional crises.There are 34 states that do not require de-escalation training for all officers, according to an analysis by APM Reports, and only eight have done so since [Mike] Brown was killed three years ago. As of February, Georgia requires one hour per year of de-escalation training.Though most states have boards that license peace officers and oversee state training requirements — boards with the power to require the training — the vast majority have failed to mandate it.That has left the decision of whether to train up to local chiefs and sheriffs. And many haven’t done it, citing, among other reasons, cost, lack of staff, and a belief that the training is unnecessary or constitutes a rebuke of traditional policing.Without statewide mandates, officer training in de-escalation varies widely from one police jurisdiction to the next, even within one metropolitan area. The inconsistency creates the troubling reality that a mentally-ill person … could be at a higher risk of being killed by police simply by traveling between cities." True link

An excerpt:However this plays out, these two latest high-profile police misconduct cases make two things clear.First, that body cameras helped. They didn’t prevent these cases from happening, but they did pull them kicking and screaming into the light of day.In Michigan, we would never have heard about what happened to those boys without video of their encounter. It would just have been the kids’ and moms’ word against that of the police. Absent footage, this militarized treatment of children almost certainly would not have come to light.In Dallas, the police claimed the car Jordan was in was charging officers, making the shooting a defensive response. Video proved that wasn’t true. Whether you believe the original story was an honest mistake or a deliberate lie, knowing the truth makes a world of difference.It is difficult to contemplate what happens in all the other cases, all the ones without video.The second thing to note is that this problem has not gone away. There is much competing for our political attention right now, but police brutality and criminal justice reform, including the indisputable role of race, cannot be neglected. It is often a discouraging and draining topic — I would be happy if I could never write about another Eric Garner, another Philando Castile, another Walter Scott.But until a lot changes, there will be another, as Jordan Edwards’ family now knows all too well.Read the rest here."

The rhetoric is anti-empire. Jesus is Lord, Caesar is not.But in practice, the political theology of many progressive Christians is Niebuhrian. That is, Christians must take and use the power of the state to address our social and international problems. The focus is upon electoral politics and democratic engagement: voting, calling Congress, etc. Jesus may be Lord, but in this unjust world Caesar is how we get stuff done. That’s Niebuhrian realism.In short, it seems to be that a lot of progressive Christians want to be Anabaptist and Niebuhrian at the same time. Or adjust our position when it suits us. Anti-empire when you need to denounce an administration. Niebuhrian when you need to win an election.   I’ve observed this dynamic in action with some frequency, and this succinct critique   —  which I am glad to see coming from a progressive Christian   — strikes me as spot-on.
