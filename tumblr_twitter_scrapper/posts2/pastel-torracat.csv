In junior year of high school I was taking History of the Americas (very very hard tests, like at least one person is guaranteed to cry). So one day I had one of these tests when I was /sick as hell/. Like I woke up and could not breathe through my nose. Everything was snot and headache and I know it‚Äôs gross, but like I‚Äôm trying to convey how desperate the times were. I went to take a DayQuil, but could only find NyQuil in the house. So i was like ‚Äúfuck it, there‚Äôs no way this could be worse. ha. Anyway i take this and get to class and like already im about to pass out so during my independent study I go out and get a coffee and a five hour energy.  Thinking like ‚Äúokay I‚Äôll die, but it should balance out for a bit.‚Äù And it did, initially. But then. As soon as I walk in the doors to class, it hit and I‚Äôm looking at my friend and he‚Äôs like ‚Äúdid you smoke, your pupils are like fucking quarters‚Äù and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúo no.‚Äù So the test starts and my brain is feeling like that substance that‚Äôs like both a liquid and a substance simultaneously. And the test format is like this huge paper. So I get going on it, and here‚Äôs what happened: -I wrote six pages front and back in 45 minutes-I felt like I could ‚Äúzoom in‚Äù ‚Äúzoom out‚Äù my vision-I asked one girl if I could borrow a pen three times and she was freaked out so I had three pens on my desk-after the test I crashed HARD in the physics room and they had to push me out of a chair to wake me up-but like, I got an A on the test.

She loves Winnie the Pooh, Beauty & the Beast, and Sesame Street. Even though the below picture is unconvincing.¬† Edna and ‚ÄúCookie.‚Äù I think she was trying to play it cool.¬† My name is Jeanie. I‚Äôm Edna‚Äôs younger sister. I‚Äôm also her guardian and caregiver.¬† That‚Äôs me on the left.¬†(Hey, you never know. After a year of writing a blog about online dating -¬†Jeanie Does the Internet¬†- I‚Äôve come to learn that there are A LOT of fools on the internet.)¬† ANYWAY, I‚Äôm¬†not ‚Äúdoing the internet‚Äù anymore. I‚Äôm taking care of Edna full-time, after completing my MFA in Writing for Screen & Television at USC. May 16, 2014. I wanted a picture. Edna wanted breakfast. In case you‚Äôre wondering where our parents are, they‚Äôre dead. Our mom died of breast cancer when she was just 33.¬† Us with mom before she died. (Obviously.) As for our dad, he peaced-out around the time my mom got sick. His loss - we‚Äôre awesome.¬† Here we are being awesome at the beach. Pushing a wheelchair in the sand? Not so awesome.¬† In case you‚Äôre wondering ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù with my sister - as a stranger once asked me on the street ¬†- ¬†NOTHING. Yes, Edna has a rare form of epilepsy - Lennox-Gastaut syndrome - but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs anymore ‚Äúwrong‚Äù than people who don‚Äôt have manners.¬† Basically, Edna was born ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù and started having seizures as a baby. They eventually got so bad that they cut off the oxygen to her brain, causing her to be mentally disabled. Or impaired. Or intellectually disabled. Or whatever you want to call it - except ‚Äúretarded,‚Äù because in 2010, President Obama signed Rosa‚Äôs Law into effect, replacing that word with ‚Äúintellectually impaired.‚Äù¬† Which is cool and all, but services for the disabled and the people who care for them are SEVERELY LACKING. Also, there‚Äôs a bunch of people working in taxpayer-funded positions who are supposed to help families like us, but don‚Äôt. (Big surprise, I know.) They just fill out paperwork (whenever they feel like it) with asinine statements like this:¬† YUP. I transport my sister down the stairs in her wheelchair, because that is not only safe, but TOTALLY PRACTICAL. Why doesn‚Äôt everyone in a wheelchair just take the stairs, for God‚Äôs sake? Stop being so lazy, PEOPLE WITHOUT WORKING LEGS!¬† But, as it says above, Edna‚Äôs legs do work. Whether or not she wants them to, is another story.¬† Edna refusing to go inside.¬† These are the¬†stairs that I have to carry her up - by myself - on a daily basis. That is, until one of my legs break and both of us are just sitting at the bottom of the stairs, helpless.¬† For six months, I have begged - BEGGED - the State of California to help my sister, which they are required by law - The Lanterman Act specifically - to do so. But they‚Äôve told me ‚Äúthese things take time‚Äù and that I ‚Äúneed to amend my expectations.‚Äù (That was said to me when I refused to place Edna at AN ALL-MALE CARE FACILITY. Because yes, that was an ‚Äúoption‚Äù that was offered to me.)¬† Prior to Edna moving in with me in my one-bedroom apartment, she was living with her amazing caregiver, Gaby, back in Tucson, where we went to high school and I did my undergrad. Edna‚Äôs reppin‚Äô the Wildcats below.¬† But back in November, Gaby also died from breast cancer. (FUCK YOU, BREAST CANCER!) This picture was taken a month before she died. She never even told me she was sick because she didn‚Äôt want me to worry.¬† By the way, we were raised by our grandma. Edna and her were very close. She‚Äôs dead, too. Surprise. She died when I was 20 and Edna was 21. That‚Äôs when I became Edna‚Äôs legal guardian and Gaby stepped into the picture to help me out with Edna.¬† So, six months ago, after Gaby died, I moved¬†Edna to California, where I tried to get the folks over at The Frank D. Lanterman Regional Center to help me.¬†I‚Äôve told them I‚Äôm worried about our safety - that one of us could get hurt on the¬†stairs - ¬†I‚Äôve told them I can‚Äôt afford to pay the private babysitters $15/hour because the ones social services sent me who make $9/hour were unreliable (they didn‚Äôt show up on time or at all so I could get to school and work), untrustworthy (one of them let Edna go to the bathroom in the kitchen and then took her into the bathroom because ‚Äúthat what I thought I was supposed to do.‚Äù)¬† But the people over at the FLRC don‚Äôt return my calls, they don‚Äôt file the paperwork on time - and the first caseworker that was assigned to us actually LAUGHED AT my sister when he came to our home to evaluate her. When I reported him to his supervisor, she told me, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just [insert name of said jackass].‚Äù¬† He was one of the two caseworkers that contributed to the report I mentioned above, which also included this:¬† So let me get this straight - I have to feed, bathe, dress and help Edna in the bathroom and you can‚Äôt deduce whether or not she is able to vote? What in the fuck?! Now I realize I seem angry. And you can bet your balls I am. I‚Äôm also sad. Sad for those who don‚Äôt have family to stick up from them and who waste away God knows where, monitored by no one. Or¬†monitored by people who physically and sexually assault them.¬† I‚Äôm also sad¬†for the caregivers who are SO EXHAUSTED - trying to take care of their loved ones - while also trying to take care of themselves and battling a system that is supposed to help, but does nothing of the sort.¬†And I know a lot of people give up. They let their dreams, their marriages, their friendships slide. All while trying not to resent the very person you‚Äôre doing it all for. Edna wanted to sit next to me the other day while I was writing. Clearly, she‚Äôs not impressed.¬† Here‚Äôs the thing: I REFUSE TO GIVE UP. I‚ÄôM NOT GIVING UP ON HER OR MYSELF. I‚Äôm going to pursue my dreams while taking care of her, AND while ensuring that the people paid to do their jobs ACTUALLY do them. That‚Äôs where you come in. I need you to help me get my story out there. Because I know I‚Äôm not alone in this. I want to connect with families¬†who are in similar situations and also show people who have no idea what it‚Äôs like to care for someone with a disability (or even a loved one who is sick) that it can be rewarding. Super fucking hard. Exhausting. Painful. Isolating. But, rewarding.¬† I‚Äôm going to get help for my sister - and others. My hope is that by sharing our story, I can bring awareness to the lack of services and help for the disabled.¬† Thank you,¬† Jeanie¬† Facebook:¬†¬†facebook.com/eisforedna Twitter: @EisforEdna¬†  This made me cry  SIGNAL BOOST   STOP SCROLLING.

Maybe we have to move and we are wondering how the pet is going to come too. A job loss can make it hard to feed ourselves and our beloved pets. Luckily, there are resources out there to help you through hard times. #1 ‚Äì IMOM This all-volunteer 501¬©(3) charity helps people cover vet bills when they just can‚Äôt do it themselves. They also help with spay/neuter and have a staff on hand to answer questions or get you the resources you need for any issues with your pet. #2 ‚Äì YouCaring.com Youcaring.com is a free crowdfunding site that focuses on raising money for people who need it for personal reasons ‚Äì everything from education to pet expenses. Each month, they have over 2,000 crowdfunding campaigns for people needing help with pet care costs. Recently, Cheryl Dohn raised more than $8,000 on her campaign (goal was only $2,500) to help her dog Roxy Mama. #3 ‚Äì RedRover RedRover.org has grants for people who need financial support. This can be for an animal you rescued (and are fostering) or your own pet. They also have a program that helps with disaster relief, criminal seizures and hoarding cases. #4 ‚Äì Harley‚Äôs Hope Foundation This nonprofit‚Äôs mission is to ensure low income pet parents and their companion or service animals remain together when issues arise. Some of the services they offer include: Pet Assistance Fund, Service Animal Aid Fund, Senior Services Project and Medical. More can be found on their website. #5 ‚Äì ASPCA The ASPCA has two programs in New York City: Spay Neuter Operations and Cruelty Intervention Advocacy, which helps those facing relinquishment. In Los Angeles, they have a free spay/neuter clinic. They not only have their own programs, but can also connect you to different resources. #6 ‚Äì Breed Specific Many breed rescues and groups have specials funds available for owners who need financial assistance. A few examples are the Special Needs Dobermans, Labrador Lifeline, and Pitbull Rescue Central. (H/T:Chewiesays.com) #7 ‚Äì Brown Dog Foundation After going through the experience of not being able to care for her dog with cancer, Carol Smock (along with six others), started Brown Dog Foundation to help others avoid the situation Smock found herself in back in 2006. It‚Äôs a public charity ‚Äúthat provides funding to families who find themselves in similar situations ‚Äì a sick pet that would likely respond to treatment, but due to an unforseen circumstance, there is not enough money immediately available to make it happen.‚Äù #8- Disease Specific Another route is to look for groups that help with specific diseases. For example, Canine Cancer Awareness,The Magic Bullet Fund, Helping Harley Fund, and Muffin Diabetes Fund. (H/T: Chewiesays.com)  #9 ‚Äì The Pet Fund The Pet Fund provides financial assistance to owners whose pets need veterinary care. In addition to their own programs, they have a lot of resources on their site, including links to many area and/or group specific programs that may fit your needs. #10 ‚Äì Banfield Charitable Trust The Banfield Pet Hospital has its own programs for owners that can‚Äôt afford their pet‚Äôs care. Of course they cover emergency surgeries, but they also cover routine, preventative care. #11 ‚Äì Meals on Wheels Many people do not realize that Meals on Wheels also helps people feed their pets. Sponsored by Banfield Pet Hostpital, the Meals on Wheels Pet Program was created to make sure seniors were able to provide food for their pets. #12 ‚Äì The Onyx & Breezy Foundation Another privately run nonprofit started in memory of the founder‚Äôs dogs, this foundation has a host of programs including helping people with medical bills. They also donate to many other programs, including cancer research, and they are a good resource for information if you need help finding a grant that fits your situation. " False link
