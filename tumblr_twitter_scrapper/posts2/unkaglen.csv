He acts more “Christian” than I do sometimes, although he’s not of the faith. He’s so forgiving, understanding, patient, and so devoted. I’ve been struggling with this for years, and I always end up coming back to him. I know and love him as he is, and vice versa. Is this an unGodly relationship because we’re technically “unequally yoked?” Am I kidding myself for thinking this could work for the long haul?Unka Glen answered: From inmates at the jailhouse, to pastors in the church house, most of the questions I get sound like this: I really wanna do this thing, and I’m gonna do this thing, and I know it’s a bad idea, but I’m gonna do it anyway, so is there a chance that it isn’t a totally bad idea?Now, don’t get me wrong, I read the Bible looking for loopholes just as much as all that other holy stuff, so I’m not judging the concept of trying to get away with something. Heck, I wouldn’t respect you if you didn’t try.But the fundamental thing is this: if you’re asking me how bad is this bad idea, then I have to ask you: why you’re so committed to an idea YOU think is bad?It’s odd how often we have tunnel vision about things. We can fixate on one person, or one solution, or one way of doing things, and lock in on that one path in a way that defies all logic. Is that evil or ungodly? Well, it ain’t even healthy, so why ask if it’s holy?I read somewhere about how they capture monkeys for the zoo.They cut a hole in a coconut, they put food at the bottom, and they tie the coconut to a tree. When the monkey works his hand down into the hole and grabs the food, he ends up making a fist, and his fist is too big to fit back through the hole.Now, all the money has to do, is let go of the food, and he’ll be free. But that monkey will hang on to that food right up until someone unties the rope from the tree and leads him off. Is the food good? Of course. Is the desire for food good? Sure, nothing wrong with that. But the point of the story is: you’re in the jungle, you’re surrounded by food! Why hang on to the one piece of food that has you in a bad circumstance?If the monkey could talk, he’d explain that sure, he MIGHT find other food, but there are no guarantees. I mean, who’s to say? Sometimes food can be hard to find! But this food is right here, I can touch it, I can smell it, and I have it. Can’t you see that?The Godly response to your desires, is to ask if this thing you want to possess would end up truly possessing you. Are you fixated on what is right in front of you, while failing to see the possibilities all around you? Are you thinking that your desires will lead to something bad, and negotiating with God on “how bad is too bad?”It would be better instead to look at your desires and say: God wants better for me than I want for myself. Then embrace that God wants to help you find that better thing, and give you the courage to take hold of it."

He should have made us better, and not make us and the world so broken, and hard to lead a good life, we should have been created to be more like Him.” I never have the right words to explain. [edited for length]Unka Glen answered: Well, shoot, neither do I. I wish God had made me a better man than I am, and that He made the world with fewer temptations. I have no idea why God made me the way He did, or the world the way He did.Ya see, It’s just a bad idea on every level to seek a smart answer to all these unanswerable statements.So, quick story to illustrate. A buddy of mine is a well-known media figure. He’s an atheist, and he was putting together a news story about religion, and he told me that he’d like to come over and ask all of these deep questions about how a person can have faith in God.He came over, asked his questions, and when the whole thing is broadcast, he explains that he asked all these questions and that everything kind of fell apart after that. He explained that he hadn’t really thought about these deep philosophical ideas about atheism since he was young.Then he explained that he was fully embarrassed when I began swatting away his questions with an expertise that someone who does this for a living is bound to have.After all this, I felt like I had acted cheeky and clever, lacking in grace and patience, and maybe I was just a bit condescending. One sentence of the conversation haunts me, though thankfully it didn’t make it on air— Him: “How can God exist if there’s so much evil in the world?”, Me: “That’s an argument that God is a jerk, not an argument that He doesn’t exist.”I suppose we all go through an immature phase where we fantasize about withering someone with a real zinger of a comeback, but when I got my chance to fulfill that adolescent fantasy, and on a pretty big stage, I saw that my devastating comebacks just made me sound kinda mean, and made him feel kinda dumb.The Bible says we should always be ready to give a reason for the hope we have in God, but that we should do so with “gentleness and respect” (1 Peter 3:15). I had used very little of either.Your friend is saying that he feels like he’s flawed in some way, and he’s tired of hating himself for it, so he’s blaming God for making him that way, and then condemning him. I’d say that your friend makes a very strong point, except for the good news that doesn’t want to condemn, He wants to heal.Don’t focus on answering the theological questions, focus on the pain and guilt and frustration that’s being laid in front of you. Be tender, be patient, and model God’s understanding." True text

Question for you, what does Genesis 3:16 mean, when it talks about the desire of the woman will be her husband, and he will rule over her?Unka Glen answered: No, you’re the best. As for Genesis 3:16, I’ll tell you what it definitely does NOT mean. God did not say that the man would rule over woman because the man was wise, and strong, and responsible, and a stable Godly influence over the whole situation.God was angry when He said the man should rule over the woman. These two people had a garden paradise with only one rule, and then they immediately went out and broke that one rule. When God put the man in charge, it was a curse. We’re talking about the genius who was first to sink his teeth into that forbidden fruit, and then tried to blame it on the woman. That’s amazing leadership right there.I can’t imagine what it’s like to be the victim of institutional misogyny, or to live in a male dominated society, any more than I can process the reality that male leadership was an actual curse, as in: “You wanna break the rules? Okay. Let’s see how you like it when THIS clown runs the circus”.But Jesus was called the “last Adam” (1 Cor. 15:45), and the Bible couldn’t be more clear that once He entered the picture, we were no longer were to live by the old way of the written code, but by the new way of the Spirit (Rom. 7:6). Even so, that somehow hasn’t stopped men from trotting out this Genesis verse, like God was handing out prizes for doing something amazing.As for the “desire of the woman to be for the man”, lots of people have puzzled over that, but I suppose it’s pretty simple. If you had no physical desire for a man, you’d have no motivation to put up with his leadership, and you’d probably just live on an island of warrior maidens and ride horses and have superpowers and have jewelry that could deflect bullets.But God made man desirable to women, and for many millennia since, they’ve put up with us. If you’re a dude and you’re reading this, maybe take a moment to thank God, and ask Him to show you the meaning of a simple word: respect. Working together as a team to serve God is the plan, and keeping the enemy from dividing you is the mission." True text

I think that’s the problem with me sometimes.  Unka Glen answered: That’s easy, just receive some humility from God.  Now, that’s maybe not the answer you were expecting, given there’s a chance that humility is what you thought you were doing, when you were beating up on yourself. But let’s take some of these negative things you might have been saying to yourself, and see what a humble person might say in that same situation.  Negative thought: I should be a better Christian than what I am.  Humble Christian: It’s amazing that I’m able to act as good as I do, given how much I crave all kinds of sin.   Negative thought: Why do I have all these lustful desires? All I can think about is committing one sin or another.  Humble Christian: Thank you Lord, that even though my flesh is totally pulling me in the wrong direction, that you’ve given me the strength to stay on the right path for another day.  Negative thought: I should feel confident that I can accomplish all these goals, but sometimes I have doubts, and then I hate myself for having those doubts.  Humble Christian: I know for sure that I will fail without you Lord. I am not up to the task, and we both know it. You put me in over my head, so I would be aware of how much I need you. I can’t do this Lord, but you can do it through me, so help me get out of the way.  Negative thought: How could I have backslid like this? I thought all this was behind me!  Humble Christian: Well Lord, this comes as no surprise given my past, and I’m sure you saw it coming, so what did I miss? How did I leave myself open to this? I know you were trying to warn me to go another way, so thank you for that…and I’m sorry for not listening.  Negative thought: I should be more committed to God. I lack that sense of zeal!  Humble Christian: Hey Lord, I feel like I’m pretty sloppy and all over the place with this Christian thing, and most of it looks like a real mess to me, but I do love you. I love you so much Lord, and I know, one day I’ll learn to do better, but right here, right now, it’s just super-important that I tell you how much I love you.   As you can see, that sense of “should” shows up a lot in those negative statements. A sense that you should be much better than what you are, that can only be based on an inflated and unrealistic view of yourself, one that you aren’t living up to. But in the humble points of view, there’s a note of thankfulness and joy behind a focus on God, rather than self.  The more you focus on God, and not yourself, the more you’ll be able to see yourself anew in His eyes. At that point insecurity, self-hate, and low self-esteem will be a thing of the past. " False text

I feel like it’s all so forced. Like, it’s eating at me from the inside out. She’s so sweet and everything, but she demands my attention and clings to me. She uses her anxiety as an excuse to say that I hate her if I don’t talk to her the way she wants me to.Wow, okay, that’s some nutty stuff. Like… squirrel poo. Nutty.When we’re dealing with odd behavior, there’s a tendency to freeze up on confronting it because we’re just so thrown off by it. People normally act within certain parameters, and when people violate that and get …nutty, then it’s hard to know how to respond.The key is to look at the things you DO know about the situation, and in this case, we do know that this is manipulative behavior. If she accuses you of hating her when you don’t talk to her just right, that’s manipulation.We have to confront this manipulation because it’s the only way a manipulative person can experience love. If I make you treat me in a loving way, I’m never fully certain that you actually love me. So, that confrontation would sound something like this:You: I need you to give me a little space. I need time to myself, and I need time for the other people in my life.Her: You hate me!You: I hate the way you’re acting right now, but I’m putting up with it, which should serve as solid proof that I love you. I think you need time to think that through and recognize that I can’t be manipulated in this way.Will all that “work”? Well… it’s kind of unfair to expect people to thank you for confronting them, no matter how gentle, or loving, or well deserved it is. Expecting everyone to be happy right away is too much to ask, and basically impossible. But a good confrontation gives you the best chance at a healthy relationship down the road.Ultimately, if you’re not willing to put up with this forever, then you will eventually break down and say something. And when it comes to confrontation, the more you put it off, the bigger the fallout." True text

More and more I feel the desire to do something that is connected with my faith but I feel lost because I do not know what it could be and how I should start. I love writing and teaching and my studies are connected with it but it feels kind of devastating not having a direction, I want to see what I can offer to other believers and how I can live out my faith. [edited for length]Unka Glen answered: First, thanks for reading, and second, bless you for your desire to get out there and share your faith. I’m happy to help you minister to people through this medium, it’s actually pretty easy once you get the right focus going.1. Know WHAT to say. Nobody wants to know what you think about anything. Nobody wants to know what I think about anything. Nor should they. Opinions are like butts, everyone has one, and most of them stink. Nobody wants to read your deep thoughts about anything. That’s some boring stuff right there.Instead, consider this: the Holy Spirit is drawing everyone to Himself. But we’re not all getting closer. We’re stuck. We might be stuck on fear of the future, or body image, or crushing guilt, or shame about our past. You name it, we got it. Get me unstuck, and I can’t wait to read what you’re writing next. Anything else, and you can forget it.2. Know HOW you want to say it. The more human and the less “holy sounding” the better. Take your desire to be a great writer and kill it dead. Be a typer that types out the words that set people free. Simple words, simple message. “It’s like a man who built a house on a rock”, any child can get the meaning of that story.3. Know WHO you want to hear it. Jesus went to where the hurting people were. He found the prostitutes, the drunkards, the tax collectors. Search blog posts for tags like “lonely” “abuse”, or “scared”. Message them a little paragraph of encouragement. That’s what I did, and still do, with this blog. We must earn the right to be heard.Anyone can give encouragement. It’s the easiest thing to do, and it’s most of what I do in my ministry job. Humble yourself and say, “I don’t have all the answers, but I love you, and I’m praying for you, and you keep talking I’ll keep listening, and eventually we’ll figure it out together” Help people find perspective, break down the lies that hold them back, and “spur them on to love and good deeds” as the Word says.Will all that add up to a career? Not in the short run, no. I’m going to save you a load of pain and frustration by boiling it all down: there are two kinds of careers in the world. A) careers that suck, but pay pretty well, B) careers that rock, but are built very slowly over time, and you will be poor and uncertain for every day of that building process.I took plan B and I never regretted it. I joined the circus. I wasn’t cut out for the Navy honey because I’m a naughty little pirate. That’s just how it is. It would have made more sense for me to work on career type B while doing career type A, but that part is up to you. There is no security and success and certainty and satisfaction all at once on day one.You’re building something here, and as the Word says, “Don’t despise small beginnings, for the Lord is pleased to see the work begin”."

I’m reluctant to pursue friendships because so many have withered away/lost touch/walked away even though I put in so much effort. I’ve prayed for lasting, Godly friends, but I feel He hasn’t/won’t provide any. How do I deal with this?Unka Glen answered: Let me read this back to you: you’re lonely, and you don’t want to make friends because you’ll eventually lose them and you don’t want to become lonely. And you’ve prayed for God to give you friends, even though you don’t want to have friends because you’d just lose them, and become lonely, even though you’re lonely already.When you have a really strong anxiety, do you notice how logic goes out the window? I know it does with me. A counselor would need to spend more time with you to give you a better diagnosis, but it sounds to me like you’re dealing with separation anxiety.Usually this starts with a trauma, like losing a family member, or having a friend move away when you were younger. This gives you anxiety out about losing other relationships, which makes you anxious in those relationships, and that anxiety hurts those relationships. Which makes you even more anxious.You can see how this downward spiral is created, and how anyone could end up in your position.Fortunately, because God cares deeply about loneliness, His Word has a lot to say about it:Isaiah 41:10 Fear not, for I am with you1 Peter 5:7 Cast all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you.Joshua 1:5 I will not leave you or forsake you.Matthew 28:20b I am with you always, to the end of the age.You know that old saying, “your worst fears have a way of making your worst fears come true”? It’s an old saying because it’s true. Don’t try to “solve” the problem of the thing you fear, challenge yourself to walk away from the fear itself. Take new friendships slow and easy, live in the moment, and don’t let the enemy get you worried about the future." True text

[edited for length]  Unka Glen answered: Okay, let me give you a big picture way of thinking about all this stuff. We can reduce almost everything in our spiritual lives down to vices and virtues.  The vices are pretty clear-cut: lust, shame, greed, cowardice, guilt, and so on. The virtues are obvious as well: love, joy, peace, faith, wisdom, conviction, hope, and so on. Now, if I have an abundance of a vice, like cowardice for example, I can pray for any of these virtues I might need to deal with that. So I may pray for a sense of peace to halt the progress of that fear, then I might pray for courage as I move forward, and then I might pray for wisdom so I know the truth that the fear was distracting me from. All that is super-simple. And here’s a few more simple things you need to know about virtues: They come in infinite supply from God (not from you) God wants you to have them When you run out (as you should, if you’re putting them to work) you then go back for more (because God has an infinite supply, and He wants to give you more) In this way we begin to truly rely on God as we come to Him for our daily spiritual needs. If we don’t have faith, or joy, or hope, or any of these other virtues, it isn’t because of our circumstances, it’s because we fail to simply receive those virtues. Now here is where things get messy. You see, we have a tendency to substitute all of these virtues for a worldly equivalent. Instead of receiving peace, we get high. Instead of receiving wisdom, we buy a book and receive only human knowledge instead. We never even ask for joy, really, we ask God for things that we think will give us the human emotion of happiness. Why would we put so much effort into chasing these weak human substitutes that keep falling short? Why not take the real thing, since it’s free, infinite, and pure? Especially since God is actually happy to give it to us? Well, who the heck knows, but your ol’ Unka Glen has a theory. I think people don’t like dealing with God directly. I think on one hand they imagine God being worn out by all our requests for forgiveness and help, so He doesn’t care about giving peace and hope to you, because…I dunno, He’s worn out or something. Like maybe He’s lost patience. And then on the other hand, there is something funny about giving up our independence, and choosing to love a life totally dependent on God. After all, we do let Him down on a regular basis, so how smart could it be to rely on the one you’re wronging so often? But let’s the Bible have the last word. It says that we should always “approach God’s throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need” (Hebrews 4:16). And Philippians 4:19 says “my God will meet ALL YOUR NEEDS according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus.”   " False text

So there’s this guy who I’ve been close friends with for a very long time, and I’ve been trying to work up the courage to ask him out after this long time. But well, a) I’m afraid of rejection, b) we belong to two different faiths. He’s Muslim and I’m Christian. Personally, I love him and every single thing about him, but my parents and some people in my church would srsly frown on an inter-religious relationship. And I don’t know how his family would feel about the matter. Some people I know can be very very prejudiced. I just don’t know what to do.Unka Glen answered: I’m sorry for the struggle you’re going through. Romance can be such a delicate thing, and when there’s this much against it, things can seem fairly impossible. But let’s strip all that away, and just look at the basic facts.First, it doesn’t matter what other people think. Ultimately, romantic relationships come down to two people. Either the two of you can make it work, or you can’t. The rest of the world can be in favor of a dying relationship, but that won’t keep it going, and the rest of the world can be against a healthy relationship, and that can’t stop it.You may have some family members or friends that insist on signing off on the major decisions in life, bless them, but sooner or later you will make a decision on your own that will upset them. It sucks, but the bottom line is this: either you’re prepared to pay your own bills, and put a roof over your own head to have your independence, or you’re going to have to do it their way.But forgetting about what everyone else thinks, we must avoid the temptation to assume that just because there are bad reasons to be against this relationship, that there must somehow be good reasons to be in favor if it. Fighting against the forces of prejudice and ignorance is not enough to hold a relationship together either.Could you fall in love? Absolutely. Could you have a healthy and wonderful dating relationship? Of course. Could you get married in some kind of ceremony that isn’t Christian, and not Muslim? Well, yeah. Would you be okay with those kids being raised exclusively in the Muslim faith, or would he be okay with them being raised exclusively as Christians?Sooner or later it becomes harder and harder to split the difference. You may have to be comfortable with the idea that this relationship may have a build in end point where neither of you can compromise. And if that’s the case, maybe it makes sense to ask him how much compromise he’s willing to make before you set down a very tough road together.You can make this work, despite the differences, and despite the objections of those around you, but that doesn’t matter. What matters is figuring out exactly how you intend on making it work, and asking yourself if this is a compromise that robs you of something that you always wanted to have in your married life."

Because I’m very worried about something bad happening to me, and I know nobody would support me so I’d be on my own. You never know! If your car gets totaled, that’s at least a thousand to buy a junker that’ll break down again in a week. But I don’t wanna hoard my money! That’s unchristian, right?Unka Glen answered: Well, Jesus did actually say, “do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth” (Mat. 6:19). But, ya know, what is a “treasure” anyway? That’s, like, what pirates have. And then they bury it. And there’s a map. And since you don’t have anything like that, it’s all cool, right?Nope. The language of the verse is clear, right down to the Greek. Storing up money just for the sake of having it is a direct violation of a Biblical command. …But let’s pull the focus back and look at this from a much wider perspective.Most of the problem I see with Christians and money comes from thinking backwards. If you let God shape your goals, the right actions are clear, and then all of your brain power goes into meeting that goal. But if you start by asking what the right actions are, all your brain power goes into whether or not you can actually pull off goals that were never clearly defined anyway.If an angel appears to you and tells you to give half of your bank account to a friend in need, then all of your brain power goes into figuring out how to adjust and survive with less. If you tell yourself that Christians are supposed to be generous, your brain is working overtime to figure out: how generous is too generous? How much is not enough? Goals first, then actions.The real question is: what is your money supposed to do for you? Most people never really answer that, and the few that do will say, “it’s supposed to make me happy”. Well, happiness is an emotion, it’s fleeting, and it’s also a choice. You can be happy for free. Some might say “money is for buying things to make me feel good about myself”. I mean, c’mon.In your case, you want your money to make you feel secure. And you’ve already worked out what’s wrong with that. There are no guarantees in life, we don’t know what the future holds, and money does not have the power to make us secure. Either we are secure in the Lord, or we are victims of random swirling chaos.If you accept that your security is in God, then you can develop basic preparations for the more predictable ups and downs of life. That might be something simple like asking yourself: “if I lost my job, how long might it take me to find another?” If you say three months, then put three months worth of salary in the bank.If you have insurance, look at the deductible, and put that much into savings so you can cover whatever insurance doesn’t, and so on. You can set up a car budget for ongoing expenses or saving towards a new one. This much is simple enough, and worth doing, but then it’s time to THINK BIG.Take something that excites you and moves you, and go for it. Say you love the work of a missionary, and you want to help him build a church. Well, you don’t have anything like this kind of money, but you can use what you do have to create a fundraising event, and start asking individuals to help support the effort, and organize people from your church to do some basic construction.It’s not about how much is enough, it’s about how many amazing opportunities await you!"

I mean, I know God loves everyone, and Jesus died for everyone. But the fact that God loves us alone doesn’t save us, we need to repent, and I guess I’m just wondering how often you all in your podcast and such reiterate all of that?Unka Glen answered: Repentance? Sure, yeah, let’s talk about repentance. The beginning of the Christian life, many of us have been told, follows this clear formula: Step 1) become aware of your sins, Step 2) feel bad about your sins, Step 3) repent of your sins.Deviate from that formula, and what would you have?  Okay, so let’s apply that formula to some of the conversations I’ve had this week, shall we?“I’ve been gang-banging for 20 years, and I only stopped when they kicked me out because of my drug habit. I have no friends, my family won’t speak to me, my enemies are still looking to kill me, and I have no backup. I know I need God, I just don’t know where to start.”“You have sinned. Feel bad about your sins, and repent.”“I’m recovering from a life of prostitution, and I was sexually abused by my step-father, and I live in a shelter. How will anyone ever love me, especially God?”“Well, to start with, prostitution is a sin, you should know that, and repent.”Do you see where I’m going with this?Have you ever done something wrong and really thought it was one hundred percent okay? Sure, in the moment, maybe you focused on the one part that was okay. Maybe you tried to excuse it, or justify it, or explain it away, and maybe that almost worked… for awhile. But deep down you always know what’s wrong. And we all know we need to repent.It’s not my job, or yours, to convict people of their sins, everyone has a conscience, and the Holy Spirit speaks to everyone’s conscience, and gives conviction, and calls us to a better and more full life. It’s all about HOW can we turn from this internal conviction towards a new life?The original Greek word for repentance is “metanoia”. That’s meta meaning change (think metamorphosis), and noia meaning thinking. Metanoia means changing the way you think. Was that the definition of repentance you were given? Yeah, me neither.Every blog post, every podcast episode, every time I sit down with an inmate at the jailhouse, I talk about changing the way we think about ourselves, our world, our sins, and God Himself. It’s about elevating our understanding, reaching new conclusions, and making new choices.Real ministry is about removing the mental obstacles that keep us from getting closer to God (like the emotion of guilt), so that we can draw nearer to God and draw strength from His love."

He always had a thing for me, and I decided to give it a shot. We dated for a couple months but it just wasn’t a good fit. So I broke up with him, but we’ve stayed friends. A month ago I met a guy from this new church I’m going to. He’s really amazing and cute and also has a really big heart. He asked me out for dinner and I told him that I recently got out of a serious relationship. But my ex doesn’t know any of this. I feel like maybe he’d feel betrayed since I’m moving on so soon. I also don’t what to tell the new guy. Like it seems weird to say “So, I’m friends with this guy I used to date, would you like me to stop talking to him?“Unka Glen answered: Wait… you’re saying… being friends with someone of the opposite gender that you don’t really want to date has created a massive mess? Hmm. I don’t think I’ve ever heard of that. I don’t hear stories like this every single day.Well okay, we all take wrong turns, and sometimes you have to take a turn to find out if it’s wrong. I get that. So let’s put all that behind us and look to the future.BEHOLD! The Six Immortal Laws of the Friendship Zone!People hate being rejected. There is no cure for this. There is no way around this. Tell the truth from the start, even if it hurts, because anything else will hurt them worse in the long run.Being friends with someone because you’re just too chicken to ask them out is WRONG. It’s dishonest, and it’s the opposite of romantic.Letting someone be your friend when you know they really want to date you is also wrong.It is perfectly okay, and probably a good idea to tell someone that friendship is a bad idea if you know they’re waiting to date you.If you want to date someone, and they tell you they’d rather be friends, it’s perfectly okay, and probably a good idea, to tell them that you don’t really want to be friends.Romantic relationships are built on attraction AND friendship. Friendship without attraction is not romance, and attraction without friendship is just infatuation. Being friends is not halfway to romance, and being attracted to one another won’t fix relationship problems." True text

Lately, they’ve been questioning me. I’m very logical and scientifically minded (I’m an RN so it’s in my wheelhouse) so I often struggle with my faith in terms of “proof” or “evidence”. It’s difficult for me to answer questions regarding why I believe what I do, when I feel like I end up saying “I just feel it real hard.” How do I respond to this?Unka Glen answered: What’s wrong with “I feel it real hard”? I think that’s a pretty solid response. I mean, imagine a song comes on and you tell your friend: “Ooh, I like this song!” And they say: “Prove it! Where’s the scientific evidence!?” A lot of our subjective experience can’t be “proven”. And Christianity is a relationship with God experienced on a purely subjective basis.Science and math are super useful for physical world stuff, but for everything else, not so much. You can use math to build a better house, but you can’t really use math to build a better marriage. You can’t use science to make a more inspiring sculpture or paint a breathtaking work of art.Sure, you can try to stretch math and science to use it in areas where it doesn’t really belong, and yes some Christians make the same mistake going the other way, by trying to create a “Christian version” of science. And both extremes are pretty silly.So let’s go back to your nursing, because it gives us another way of looking at this. A big part of being a nurse is listening. Someone has symptoms, some are relevant to the problem, some might be a bit …imagined, but you need to sort through all of that, to get a sense of the truth about what’s happening with them.Our faith journey should resemble this process of exploring a deeper and hidden reality, by listening to what others are going through and what they’ve learned as a result. By contrast, Christians and atheists alike often think of Christianity as a rigid series of propositions that must be upheld by logic and reason.But Paul gives us a different view, he says that one day we will pass on to the next life, and then we will know all kinds of things we don’t currently know. “Now we see only a dim reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.” (1 Corinthians 13:12)Picture an ancient mirror, a sheet of copper or bronze, hammered flat until it gives a very lumpy and misshapen reflection. You might be better off asking someone, “how do I look?” You’d have to move that lumpy mirror around a bit, and see things from different angles, in order to get a real sense of what your reflection is because it would be so dim.When this verse says “dim” reflections, the original Greek is: αἴνιγμα. That Greek word is pronounced like this: enigma. It’s a mystery to be investigated, it’s a world where we must discern the lumpy distortions from the accurate reflections, it’s a world we are exploring and discovering together little by little.Some people may have a better look at things than you do, others may not really be exploring at all, but we all see an angle that others may not see."

I don’t go to church or my bible study anymore. Reason being, I’m filled with rage every time I think about Him. I’m gay but I’m not supposed to be. God does nothing, and I hate Him for it. He’s more absent than my real dad. I’m stuck in this place and I’m not sure how to move on. I’m considering walking away from my faith completely. A new perspective would be appreciated.Unka Glen answered: Okay, let’s make a few things clear from the start…I don’t blame you for being filled with rageNeither does GodIt’s time you got an apology from Christians, so let me say be the one to say it: I’m deeply sorry for the way Christians have treated youGod takes me as I am, despite how messed up I am, and He takes you too. Screw everybody else. They don’t get it, they ain’t in on this, and they don’t get a say-so.Christians owe you (and, frankly, the rest of us) an apology for giving us the almost laughable idea that if Jesus sat down at our kitchen table to discuss our life with us, the first thing, or perhaps the only thing He’d want to talk about is our sex life.In your case, He’d want to talk with you about your dad being absent from your life. This has impacted nearly every aspect of your life, and it would be cruel for God to judge you for any of the problems and struggles that are related to your dad not being around. Even if those struggles include feeling angry at God.God accepts you. Right now. As you are. He has plans for you, and a calling, and a purpose, and if you follow Him, it will be an amazing journey through all kinds of twists and turns.Your sexuality, like everyone else’s, will eventually come up in the conversation, and at that time God will strengthen you to make changes to that sex life, so that it can become more fulfilling and enjoyable.But here’s a fact that Christians don’t want you to hear: even if you make none of those changes, even if you run away from God, He will still love you. And if you make all these changes He will not love you more. He can’t love you more. You are loved to the uttermost, and your behavior does not have the power to change that.And I love you. Right now. As you are. There are plenty of other Christians who feel the same way. It may take some looking to find them, and that looking may involve some heartbreak, but that’s what finding quality relationships is all about." True text

When we broke up, he gave me this hope that once he’s okay, we might talk again in the future about our relationship. But 2 months after we broke up, he said that he’s not ready for a relationship again. I do understand him seeking spiritual growth but I felt so confused and hurt. How do I get through this? I really don’t know what to do.Unka Glen answered: Move on. I know it hurts like crazy, and it’ll take time to process, but moving on and letting him work out his own issues is the best for you and for him. That’s despite the obvious fact that dating relationships are not automatically a distraction from our relationship with God. To support our effort to move on, let’s remember a few essential points:Unka Glen’s Rule Number One of Dating: you deserve to be with someone who is absolutely certain that they want to be with you.Also, you deserve to be with someone who wants to be with you TODAY.Also, we don’t wait for people unless they ask us to wait (and we don’t always wait when they ask).So the path is clear. Moving on is the right path, but as you say, how do you get through this? The first step is acceptance.Emotionally, it doesn’t seem like something so big and so meaningful could just…end. We want to analyze it, solve the puzzle of it, look at it from every angle. But when we’re done with that, it’ll still be over. To be sure, it’s important to learn from this breakup, but if you can’t accept what’s happening, you can’t process what’s happening.When people talk about good relationships, they wrongly think in terms of compatibility solving all the problems, but the truth is, bad timing can undo any dating relationship. Two people can be perfect for one another, but if they’re just not in the right place at the right time, it’s not going to work.Nothing is as heartbreaking as almost being in sync. And of course, we date with the intention that this could be “the one”. So nobody could fault you for feeling like your world is upside down right now. But it’s not answers you need right now, it’s healing. Let God be there for you in this moment. Let Him put the pieces back together and make you stronger than you were before." True text

My roommate is an atheist, and he’s always debating me about my faith, and the truth is, sometimes I feel uncertain after we talk. I still believe, but it’s like I don’t know what to think about it, and how to have peace about it. Any advice?Unka Glen answered: Sure. Stop having this same conversation over and over. Instead, let’s recognize some important truths:When atheists talk to me about religion, roughly 100 percent of the time it’s so I could talk them out of atheism, not the other way around. Think about it, if you see someone who believes in something that gives them comfort, purpose, meaning, and a solid moral compass, do you really say to yourself, “I need to crap all over that!”?So ask him, why do YOU keep bringing this up? Why are YOU so hung up on this? What’s your actual, honest problem with Christianity? And don’t give me an intellectual answer to that question, because…At long last, Christianity is a relationship with God, and like all relationships, it’s not subject to scientific or intellectual scrutiny. Now, true enough, you can point out that a person has an unhealthy or dishonest association with a religion (and lots of people do), but that’s not what he’s talking about.He’s trying to comment on your relationship with God when he doesn’t know your heart any more than you know his. He doesn’t know what you’ve seen and felt and experienced. It makes no scientific or intellectual sense to say, “I have never seen or experienced this, so therefore it does not exist. It seems untrue to me, so therefore it’s untrue for everyone else.”People aren’t aggressively atheistic for intellectual or logical or empirical reasons, it’s because anything else seems impossible. Someone said that they just weren’t good enough when they already felt like they weren’t good enough, someone said that their particular sin put them on the outside looking in, someone hurt them, and that someone claimed to be a Christian.So if you debate someone in an intellectual way, you’ll only be offending those hurt feelings over and over. It’s disrespectful to people who are suffering to tell them that their pain is “wrong”, even if they aren’t expressing that pain to you, even if they’re acting like a jerk, even if they’re crapping on your faith. Hurting people hurt people. And it’s not too much to ask for you and me to be a little understanding about that.Bonus story: A friend of mine, a fairly famous dude, who was raised Jewish, but later became an atheist, would always ask me about Christianity when we’d see each other. He would even show up to places where I was preaching (and freak everybody out).One day, I turned to him and said, “you’re an amazing person, but you’re a lousy atheist. Deep down you want to believe every word I say, I can see it in you, but something is holding you back, and I wish you’d tell me what that is.” He sighed heavily, and said, “I had relatives that were killed in concentration camps in Auschwitz. I could never tell my family that I’ve become a Christian”.It’s not about debating or “converting” people, it’s about helping people find a way to accept Christ when being a Christian seems unacceptable."

Oh, I know that you feel like you have to be mean about some things because it’s in the Bible, but “speaking the truth in love”, according to Ephesians 4:15, is still the actual Biblical way to go about spreading, ya know, the Bible.  Sure, but you still want to be against something anyway, right? Here goes: a church in a rich neighborhood passes the offering plate, and that’s their money, then a church in a poor neighborhood does the same. As a result, people are rewarded for ministering to the rich, and punished for ministering to the poor. That’s a wrongness as grievous to the heart of the Lord as it can be (as He made ABUNDANTLY CLEAR in scripture), and yet it’s systemically hard-wired into the nearly the whole of Christendom itself. But bless your heart, here’s you, with your little truth detector, looking for something to be against, and something that huge goes right by you, and yet you’ll spot what you think of as some little theological flaw in something you didn’t bother to really pay attention to, and you’re off and running to give your opinion about it. Oh, and that’s another thing, you know how we sometimes describe a person as “opinionated”? That’s not a compliment. Nobody really cares about your opinion. Or mine. Sure, some Godly wisdom and insight would be good, but think about it, when was the last time you actually prayed about something before flaming up a message board, or leaving a particularly troll-like comment on someone’s post? Sure, if you see something wrong, and you feel led to speak up, do the Biblical thing and speak to them alone, Matthew 18:15 says that “if your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault, just between the two of you”. I suppose if we’re using the language of the internet, that would be to send them a private message, as opposed to posting a comment. We don’t need you to be the “sin police”, we know where sin is: basically everywhere. And yes, we all get wound up after reading certain things on the internet, and suddenly we’re hitting that “reply” button before we even think, let alone pray. So let’s all agree, give it time, let God’s opinion be heard, and if there’s an insight, let it be spoken in love and gentleness.  Galatians 5:23 says that people led by the Spirit will bear fruit, and among other things, that fruit will be: love, peace, patience, kindness, and gentleness. Galatians 6:1 says we should “gently restore” people who are lost in sin. The world is full of clattering, clanging, loud, mean, and ugly words. But to be Christian is to make the world a more beautiful place.  Let there be more light than heat in your words. Speak the truth that sets people free. Love first, and speak second. Okay? As you were. " False text

I’m not trying to flatter you, but how do you know how to answer people’s questions like that? What school did you attend to learn to minister the way you do?  Unka Glen answered: I didn’t go to school to learn ministry, I went to jail. Well, prison ministry to be exact. The problem with an academic approach to Christianity is that Christianity doesn’t lend itself much to academics. I mean, Jesus did decide that it was simple enough to leave a fisherman in charge after all. You see, the thing about academics, is that it’s all about knowing the answers. And in the case of Christianity, the answers are REALLY simple. We sinned, Jesus paid for it, you receive the payment, you’re saved, and from now on, you let Him call shots. That’s about 90% of Christianity in one sentence.  The other 10% is even simpler. Baptism? A public declaration of your decision to die to your old life and be reborn into a new life. The trinity? It’s like a cake, it’s got three layers, but it’s all one cake. Book of Revelations? Two words: be ready. Sure, you can make it complicated if you really want to, but the problem is, the more complicated you’re making it, the further it is from the heart of Christianity. The simple stuff is the deep stuff. Take grace for example. Grace is getting something good when you deserve something bad. Simple. But it’s the staggering implications of grace that make us constantly marvel at the heart of God. Christianity is simple, but life… well, life is complicated. So ministry is all about “how do I get there?“  A test, as in school, might go like this: Q: What’s the Christian thing to do if someone has wronged you and you’re angry? Well, even a young child knows the answer to that one. A: Forgive But ya see, the real question in the real world for real people like you and me is: HOW do I do that? What are the steps in between anger and forgiveness?  Q: What do I do when I have doubts? A: Have faith. Yeah, but how do I get there? How do I work through those doubts? Map that road out for me! That’s ministry. Ministry is all about how we get from the complicated problem to the obvious solution.  It’s not merely knowing the Bible in an academic sense, it’s about being in relationship with God so we can figure out how to live it in the real world. Knowing the Bible does not give us eternal life (trust me, the enemy knows every word on every page), it’s about coming to Jesus and receiving life.  As Jesus Himself said to the scholars of the day, “You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me, yet you refuse to come to me to receive life” (John 5:39-40). If you have someone in your life that you want to help, don’t try to figure out the right answer, try to map out the road between where they are and where God wants them to be. " False text

After I got dumped, my grades fell, and now my parents are barely speaking to me. I hate myself for all this.Unka Glen answered: Well, stop it. I mean yeah, if you look back at your past, and you decide that your past defines you, then you won’t love yourself, now or ever, because you’ll always have a past, and this will always be in it.

unkaglen 160033122177 "2017-04-27 01:43:25 GMT" http://unkaglen.tumblr.com/post/160033122177 "hedied4me-ilive4him asked: Hey, I was wondering if you could drop some knowledge. My aunt started this organization to help feed the homeless. And I’ve been helping her by going down to Detroit, in the bad parts. Things were going well up until last week. Things got a little dangerous and we only had one guy with us. And there was a guy that kept trying to call out to me. It’s mainly a bunch of women feeding the homeless. Do you have any tips?Unka Glen answered: Sure do, but first let me take the time to say how much you rock and how much your Auntie rocks. Homeless ministry is not the easiest place to start (as opposed to prison ministry, crisis pregnancy centers, drop-in centers, tutoring programs, and so on). So let’s draw up a few simple parameters…First, it may sound cynical, but it’s true: to the extent that people can take advantage of you, they will. That means getting familiar with the word “no”, that means drawing strict boundaries. That means being neither angry with, or tempted by, manipulation. And it means bringing several very large Christian brothers with you wherever you go.Second, quality inner city ministries don’t take senseless risks. Sure it’s a crazy environment, and anything can happen, but there’s a smart and safe way to do everything. If people see you take a dumb risk, they might think that you’re, well… dumb. Third, dial in this mix: no judgment, lots of love, and ease with confrontation. “I know you’ve got your ways, and Lord knows I don’t have the right to judge any of it, but I care about you, and it breaks my heart to see you out here like this, and so now I’m gonna bug you about getting your narrow butt into a shelter!”Finally, figure out how to sort your challenges. Some homeless people are just down on their luck and need to find a shelter; some of them don’t want to be in a shelter. You can’t help all of these people all the time, so start with whoever is ready to go to a shelter.Some of these people could afford to pay rent if they had work, so grab them and find out who’s hiring (don’t just dump job center information on them). Some are veterans, and the VA can do a lot to help them if you’re willing to spend some time with them on paperwork. You’re dealing with lots of people who are caught up in addiction, and some of them are actually willing to go to a 12 step program if you can help them find one.The point is, do everything you can to integrate with other programs that do things you can’t (that’s exactly what we do) and put your focus on people who are ready to move forward today. They’ll keep you plenty busy until the rest come around." True text

This is an awesome example of that, and beautifully written.  Sweetest Simpliicity writes: I was going through some of my bookmarks and I was reading one of Unka Glen’s answer to a question about loneliness and the dissatisfaction that drives us to crave and desire companionship. If you guys have a chance, you should read Unka Glen’s post (it’s a good read), but one part that particularly stood out to me was: Then, when you do meet that man of your dreams, the one that you fell for just because he’s awesome, you’ll take a certain quiet confidence into that relationship that says, “I want you, but I don’t need you. I need God, and I have God. I don’t need you to complete me, and I don’t need you to be the wind beneath my wings, because God’s got me. I’m looking for a man who can help me take all that to another level, and help me step up my game.  “I want you, but I don’t need you.” If I just said that to my boyfriend, it kind of sounds a little…odd, doesn’t it? But then when I think about it, if I have that kind of heart where I find my satisfaction and my needs in God, I have so much more potential to love those around me. If I needed my boyfriend to fit all the expectations I have about a boyfriend, there wouldn’t be any room for me to love him. The more obsessed I am with satisfying the idealized companionship and attention that I desire, the more this relationship will be about me. I know this first hand through my own experience and seeing it in my own heart. But what I learned through seeking to satisfy the insecurities and greed of companionship in my heart is that when I am not seeking God, I am never satisfied and I begin to abuse my relationship with the closest people around me. I demand things from others and I lose sight of what it means to love others. When we let our desire to satisfy our loneliness or craving for comfort, we become self-seeking instead of outward-loving individuals. I believe that finding contentment and completeness in God is important for not only single individuals, but also couples as well. If an individual can not find satisfaction in themselves or in their own relationships, they will continue to seek and long to fill that dissatisfaction at all different means. This will only continue to feed into that self-seeking mindset where it asks, “who can best serve me and fill me?” Love is not self-seeking (1 Corinthians 13:5) and even when we find our contentment in God, God calls us to direct our love to others once we are filled with all that we need. This is something I’m recently learning and I’m beginning to understand how true this is and how much finding my satisfaction with God enables me to love those around me more. May I find all that I need in God so that I can desire to love those more around me. “I don’t need you, but I want to love you.” May my heart love accordingly to not what people can or cannot do to fulfill my needs, but may my heart say, regardless of what you can or cannot do to provide for me, I desire to provide for your every need. Because of all things, love is not selfish.”  " True link

Anonymous asked:My brother is  recently out of a one-year Christian rehab program. I’m scared he’ll  lose the values he learned, and go back to his addiction. I’ve always  been much more religious than him, who was not attached to God ad all  before going in, or even before his addiction began. The addiction caused him to do things to tear us  apart and our relationship is not yet mended fully. So I don’t think I  can do much, but I want something to be done to “secure” him or  something, I don’t know. I’m not too sure what I’m asking. I just know I’m  terribly worried for him, and since you work with “the like,” I figured  you had some good bits of advice or something. Jed Brewer replied:Thanks for your question.  I *do* work with folks coming out of addiction, and I can relate to everything you’re saying here. When folks are in twelve-step programs or other  similar addiction recovery programs, they often learn the prayer, “God,  grant me the serenity to accepts the things I cannot change, courage to  change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.” This prayer is important for the friends and family of folks coming out of addiction, too.  A lot of folks struggle with trying to “fix” the situation, and exert control they don’t possess.  But, as you noted, although you want to do something, but it feels like there isn’t much you can do, so, where does that leave us? The truth is that you cannot make your brother stay clean and sober.  In fact, no one can do that.  The  only way that happens is your brother choosing  sobriety-by-the-grace-of-God, day after day, every day for the rest of  his life. But you can support your brother in the midst of his recovery.  Here’s how you do that: -       Refuse to pity him in any way about anything.  And refuse to enable him in pitying himself.  Self-pity is the deadliest poison an addict can drink.  It is the first step to every backslide.  (“I sure do feel bad about myself.  Hmmm.  Now, what might make me feel better?”)  You refuse to pity him because he is not pitiful.  His life matters and is worth living, and, dang it, his sister is gonna insist that he gets his narrow behind in gear on that. -       Make sure it remains his recovery.  Your brother’s recovery is, ultimately, between him and God.  When other people try to butt in on that process, problems occur.  If he asks for a ride to an NA meeting, for sure, give him a lift.  But  if he wants you to remind him that he needs to go to NA meetings,  kindly tell him to be a grown man and handle his own affairs. -      Give him only the trust that he earns.  In every healthy relationship, trust is earned.  Never given.  Addicts have universally betrayed the trust of their family members.  The  two wrong approaches folks take off of that are to (a) refuse to ever  trust that person again (which isn’t exactly “Christian”), or (b) to  start extending them a line of trust they haven’t yet shown a capacity  to handle.  (“Sure, I know you’ve only been out of detox for a day, but, of course I want you to drive my brand new car!  That’s what family does!”) In a situation where trust has been betrayed, you give small opportunities for trust to be earned.  (Kind of like you would do with a young adolescent.)  So, for example, your bro wants you to give him a ride to some place.  You don’t say, “Of course I’ll re-arrange my whole schedule to be able to pick you up!”  You do say, ”Ok, Charlie.  You call me at lunch tomorrow to confirm that we’re still going.  Then, you call me again 30 minutes in advance to confirm to me that you’re at wherever I’m gonna pick you up from.  If I don’t get both calls, I don’t show.”  Then you live by that. A lot of this sounds, well, kinda harsh.  But this is one of those situations where you have to “be cruel to be kind”.  The point in setting these very firm boundaries is to ensure that you are able to be there for this person when they are ready for a real change in their life.  If  you pour out everything you’ve got at a point where they aren’t yet  ready for a permanent change, you’re tempting yourself to not be there for them when they are ready to change.  And that’s no good at all. Lastly, I’m praying for ya, and for your brother.   This is a difficult road to walk, and my ask box is always open.  Don’t be a stranger." True link
