She gave me her STI results and said she was “clean”.  I hate that phrase so fucking hard.  I have family with various medical conditions and it doesn’t make them dirty. I’ve also had partners with STIs and you just have to be tested often, use protection and be a little creative. I am negative for STIs and I keep copies of my paperwork but I didn’t even tell her that cuz her response pissed me off so bad.  Now she stopped talking to me. I guess, I’m dirty too? The fuck?  The language you use matters. Your status is either negative or positive.  THANK YOU.  Related rant: I’ve had people flip out at me because I say STI status isn’t an instant dealbreaker as long as we can have an honest conversation about it and what precautions need to be taken. Like, not only is there the shame on people who have them (hence the “dirty” language), but if you don’t immediately reject and ostracize anyone you know who has or had ever had one, you’re a bad person too for not beating up on them? What the hell. I had a long-term relationship with somebody with HSV2 and when I went to get specialized testing after we broke up, the doctor grilled me on our safer sex practices and then told me that honestly he’d do the tests but he already knew I didn’t have it (and I didn’t). I’ve had several conversations with my sexual health providers related to this - that “just never get within breathing distance of somebody who isn’t ‘clean’” is fallacious and shameful. Meanwhile, I guarantee you that people are walking around with STIs that are undiagnosed or that they don’t tell people about because of the stigma. My most recent ex-boyfriend lied to me for like 2+ years about an unprotected one-night stand he had with some random person while heavily intoxicated because he was so invested in the image of himself as a person who would ~never do that~ until it turned out there was a very real possibility that he might have something incurable as a result. It turned out to be a false positive, but I got slapped with the emotional labor of coddling him through his shame because he was too self-centered to admit he’d done something to put me at risk. Hell, when I found out my first girlfriend ever was sleeping with other people and lying to me about it, her defense was that it was cool that she didn’t want to talk to me about it because “lesbians don’t get STDs anyway.” My ex, who gave me chlamydia years ago (which incidentally my doc referred to as “the strep throat of STIs”), was so insulted that I asked him to get tested before we slept together. His exact words were “the girls I’ve been with aren’t the type to get STDs.” I lit him up, because wtf does that even mean, and he got tested, and by that I mean he FAKED HIS TEST RESULTS because that was easier and less shameful somehow than going to the doctor.  It’s not about STIs. It’s about consent and respecting people enough to be honest with them.  I never even knew the word “clean” could be perceived like that. Damn.  I’m reblogging this because I recently had a partner send me fake STI results and it feels like complete bullshit. Because of this, I got checked out at Planned Parenthood last week. I’m negative for STIs yet I feel lied to. If people could/would openly talk about health concerns then this wouldn’t happen. Please have real conversations about safer sex with your partners.

I’ve seen this post making the rounds. Just wanted to add something to it that my sister-in-law once told me: “A ‘special thing’ can make any occasion special.” She told me this when I objected to her opening a really expensive bottle of champagne just to watch a movie. And you know, she was right. The champagne was amazing and while we always sit around and watch movies, that bottle made that night a really special occasion that I will always remember.  So, cut yourself a little slack and remember that an ordinary day can become special.   My mother has always had a habit of buying what she calls “love gifts”. Essentially she would buy me my favorite snack or take me to get iced coffee or buy me fuzzy socks something like that Her reason for that was simply because she thought of us at work and wanted to get something as a way of saying “I was thinking about you and I love you” Now as a kid I just took the presents but when I got older I felt a little bad She didn’t always buy something small, sometimes it was some new makeup or video games or something else that was more than just a few bucks When I told her “hey mom it’s sweet that you do this, but you don’t have to go do this all the time. You can just wait until a special day or a special occasion” She just looked at me and said “but Samantha, this is a love gift, and I love you every day not just the special ones” And ever since she said that I haven’t objected again  This is so important!!! I’ve done this my whole life but have been trying to break the HABIT. By holding back these desirable things from yourself for a time that you feel worthy, you are adding to the intrusive thoughts that you are not good enough, that someone is more deserving than you.Wear your favorite shirt to the grocery store too, not just on your birthday or the first date with a guy who you’ve met once before. Wear your favorite shirt ESPECIALLY when you don’t “feel worthy”.  If a dog has a favorite toy it’s not going to ignore it and play with a different one simply to appeal to this notion that we have to earn happiness and enjoyment.  Yes there are “special days” but ultimately there are just “days” and you only have so many.  Tl; dr: Wear the clothes, eat the food, life’s short. " False text

Especially for trans women who feel gross or out of place for their deep voice.  Please, break the standard that all women have high pitched, perfect, feminine voices.  My car got towed on NYE, so after unsuccessfully trying every number programmed into my phone, I called my dad’s ass up at 2 AM to pick up myself and my friends to go get my vehicle out of impound (my dad is awesome. More on that later.)  Included in my group of friends was my friend Anna who had recently come forward as trans. She had very recently started presenting as a woman, and was pretty insecure in it, and had never met my father previously, so it wasn’t as though I had time to brief him on the situation. Anna was pretty shy during the whole ride, tucked in the back and letting her friends talk over her. She only spoke up after I had gotten my car back, thanking him for helping out. The next day, I called to thank him for that night, and he asked me who was the girl with the deep voice. At first my heart sink in my guts, but without missing a beat, he started raving about how he LOVED her voice. He listed off a few actresses from his day who had had very deep voices, and how he adored it, and that kind of slow sultry speaking had been fading more and more as pop culture pushed for childish voices in women. Your deep voice is gorgeous trans friends (and cis friends too.) it is warm and low and smooth like honey and perfect in every way. It is smoldering and evocative and absolutely beautiful.  Growly lady voices do me the pitter pat!. Nomi from sense 8 has a perfect smoky voice that just feels great in my ears  It took a shitton of work to bring my voice anywhere near high, and I can’t sing without bringing it lower, and this makes me feel really happy. Deep voices are good as heck. <3" False text
