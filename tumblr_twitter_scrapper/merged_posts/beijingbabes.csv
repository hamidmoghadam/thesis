You formed your new unit Triple H with E'Dawn and Hui. How do you feel?Hyuna: I feel great to form a new unit with the Pentagon members, who are the future of Cube Entertainment. Some people say Cube uses me to promote them, but I have a lot to learn from them too. I was very nervous when I was preparing for Triple H’s first album.Q. What’s your relationship with the two young members?Hyuna: They might feel uncomfortable being with me, but we try to take care of each other. I think we’re still trying to find common ground.Q. You appeared on Music Core and Inkigayo last week. Were you satisfied with your performance?Hyuna: Even though I appeared on only two music chart shows because music chart shows these days are not that popular, I love my costume with a floral pattern. And it’s fun to wink too. I didn’t know I’m that much cute, haha.   Q. It’s notable that you acted in Triple H’s music video.Hyuna: It’s meaningful to me, but I don’t think I’m good at acting. I’m still nervous when I sing on stage even though it has been 10 years since debut, and I think I should concentrate on singing rather than acting.Q. There many idols who cross the line between singing and acting, though.Hyuna: My father dreamed of becoming an actor, and that’s why he made me take auditions to be an actress when I was young. But I failed about 50 auditions, haha. People say I’m really talented, but I’m not. I just could improve my ability thanks to my father and agency, and I’m still trying to learn. My father is the one who always supports me. When I caught in a controversy, he doesn’t worry about it or try to console me. Instead, he just says “That’s my girl. She did so great that many people speak ill of you”.Q. Triple H’s music video is caught in a controversy because it has some suggestive scenes.Hyuna: Well, I just tried not to be nervous, and I wanted to express what the director wanted. I wanted to try something new. Actually, I don’t like being physically affectionate. I like to have physical contact with girls. Anyway, I’ll try to calm the controversy by showing great performance on stage.Q. It has been 10 years since your debut. How do you feel?Hyuna: I feel more responsible now. When I debuted, there were only 5 staff members in Cube Entertainment. Some people say I’m the Cinderella or breadwinner of Cube, but I think I’m Cube’s first daughter. I’ve been following Cube’s growth for many years, and I hope to earn a lot of money because I really want to make my staff members happy. Q. Is there anything changed after 4minute has been disbanded? Hyuna: I think my activity as a member of Triple H is an extension of my activities as a member of 4minute and Trouble Maker. One thing has changed, though. In the old days, I was on a steady, straight path, and I felt like I was being chased by many things. But these days, I became more comfortable. I mean, I appreciate the small things now. I found true happiness.Q. What’s your goal?Hyuna: When I was very young, I imitated Psy’s dance moves on the stage of Dongdaemun market. But I later became the heroine of his music video. Well, I think I’m very lucky. There were many good people around me, and I was loved by so many people. I don’t follow my dream anymore. Instead, I’ll work hard and try not to miss a good opportunity. And I’ll try to do my best in return for my fans’ love.   cr: kpopbehind " False text

Our one advantage is that we might learn from their experience. Now is a good time to do so. Here are twenty lessons from the twentieth century, adapted to the circumstances of today: 1. Do not obey in advance. Much of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. In times like these, individuals think ahead about what a more repressive government will want, and then start to do it without being asked. You’ve already done this, haven’t you? Stop. Anticipatory obedience teaches authorities what is possible and accelerates unfreedom. 2. Defend an institution. Defend an institution. Follow the courts or the media, or a court or a newspaper. Do not speak of “our institutions” unless you are making them yours by acting on their behalf. Institutions don’t protect themselves. They go down like dominoes unless each is defended from the beginning. 3. Recall professional ethics. When the leaders of state set a negative example, professional commitments to just practice become much more important. It is hard to break a rule-of-law state without lawyers, and it is hard to have show trials without judges. 4. When listening to politicians, distinguish certain words. Look out for the expansive use of “terrorism” and “extremism.” Be alive to the fatal notions of “exception” and “emergency.” Be angry about the treacherous use of patriotic vocabulary. 5. Be calm when the unthinkable arrives. When the terrorist attack comes, remember that all authoritarians at all times either await or plan such events in order to consolidate power. Think of the Reichstag fire. The sudden disaster that requires the end of the balance of power, the end of opposition parties, and so on, is the oldest trick in the Hitlerian book. Don’t fall for it. 6. Be kind to our language. Avoid pronouncing the phrases everyone else does. Think up your own way of speaking, even if only to convey that thing you think everyone is saying. (Don’t use the internet before bed. Charge your gadgets away from your bedroom, and read.) What to read? Perhaps The Power of the Powerless by Václav Havel, 1984 by George Orwell, The Captive Mind by Czesław Milosz, The Rebel by Albert Camus, The Origins of Totalitarianism by Hannah Arendt, or Nothing is True and Everything is Possible by Peter Pomerantsev. 7. Stand out. Someone has to. It is easy, in words and deeds, to follow along. It can feel strange to do or say something different. But without that unease, there is no freedom. And the moment you set an example, the spell of the status quo is broken, and others will follow. 8. Believe in truth. To abandon facts is to abandon freedom. If nothing is true, then no one can criticize power, because there is no basis upon which to do so. If nothing is true, then all is spectacle. The biggest wallet pays for the most blinding lights. 9. Investigate. Figure things out for yourself. Spend more time with long articles. Subsidize investigative journalism by subscribing to print media. Realize that some of what is on your screen is there to harm you. Bookmark PropOrNot or other sites that investigate foreign propaganda pushes. 10. Practice corporeal politics. Power wants your body softening in your chair and your emotions dissipating on the screen. Get outside. Put your body in unfamiliar places with unfamiliar people. Make new friends and march with them. 11. Make eye contact and small talk. This is not just polite. It is a way to stay in touch with your surroundings, break down unnecessary social barriers, and come to understand whom you should and should not trust. If we enter a culture of denunciation, you will want to know the psychological landscape of your daily life. 12. Take responsibility for the face of the world. Notice the swastikas and the other signs of hate. Do not look away and do not get used to them. Remove them yourself and set an example for others to do so. 13. Hinder the one-party state. The parties that took over states were once something else. They exploited a historical moment to make political life impossible for their rivals. Vote in local and state elections while you can. 14. Give regularly to good causes, if you can. Pick a charity and set up autopay. Then you will know that you have made a free choice that is supporting civil society helping others doing something good. 15. Establish a private life. Nastier rulers will use what they know about you to push you around. Scrub your computer of malware. Remember that email is skywriting. Consider using alternative forms of the internet, or simply using it less. Have personal exchanges in person. For the same reason, resolve any legal trouble. Authoritarianism works as a blackmail state, looking for the hook on which to hang you. Try not to have too many hooks. 16. Learn from others in other countries. Keep up your friendships abroad, or make new friends abroad. The present difficulties here are an element of a general trend. And no country is going to find a solution by itself. Make sure you and your family have passports. 17. Watch out for the paramilitaries. When the men with guns who have always claimed to be against the system start wearing uniforms and marching around with torches and pictures of a Leader, the end is nigh. When the pro-Leader paramilitary and the official police and military intermingle, the game is over. 18. Be reflective if you must be armed. If you carry a weapon in public service, God bless you and keep you. But know that evils of the past involved policemen and soldiers finding themselves, one day, doing irregular things. Be ready to say no. (If you do not know what this means, contact the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and ask about training in professional ethics.) 19. Be as courageous as you can. If none of us is prepared to die for freedom, then all of us will die in unfreedom. 20. Be a patriot. The incoming president is not. Set a good example of what America means for the generations to come. They will need it.  this is really good, everyone should read it, especially if you’re from the US." False link

As I mentioned I am more than willing to talk about this situation to those who are looking to help out in any way they can, it’s a really heavy situation for me so I couldn’t write all about it here. That wouldn’t be possible. I’m putting this up because I recently ran away from the mentally and physically abusive household I was raised in. Finally, after enduring abuse and trauma daily for as long as I could remember, I was able to flee from that nightmare. I am a 24 y/o woc from a South Asian Muslim household from Montreal. Last week after work, instead of returning back home I ran away because I found the opportunity that I had been waiting for all of my life. Because that moment was so sudden, I left with nothing but the clothes on my back, my phone and my wallet. I now have to recover all of my legal documents, eyewear and my retainers which I absolutely need all of which I absolutely need. I come from a stereotypical strict, horrendously restrictive and misogynistic Muslim household where I was discouraged to grow independent. It hurts a lot because my family fills a stereotype that I really hate of muslims and south asians but unfortunately my family just is regressive in every sense. I was controlled and abused by all sides of my family and I was taught the only way out was through an arranged marriage with a stranger. As a result I have no formal education, because my family did not allow me to study because they didn’t want me to be financially independent or in any way educated about the real world. The toxic environment I was forced to stay in fed my depression and anxiety and I wasn’t able to get help for this even at my worse, I had no family to turn to and was not allowed friends to speak to on these matters that weren’t already ingrained in the same society. When I would feel extremely suicidal. I wasn’t allowed to receive any help as mental illnesses are not taken seriously in our family and community. I was forbidden to leave the house at any time out and do anything that I needed to do without fear of violence or abuse because of how restrictive my family was with me. I had to be in bed by 11 pm, and my phone was locked away by my parents until she allowed me to use it again during the day. I could not be out of the house unless it was for school or light errands and I was only allowed to study what my mother allowed me to study which were fields where I couldn’t see a future for myself in. Her idea was that I rely on an arranged marriage and husband to do take full responsibility of me; that I always remain dependent. There is a history of misogyny with my mother, and since she had more girls that she ever wanted, I being the youngest one was too much for her to love and instead of just letting me go or kicking me out she used me as a means of control for what she lacked in life, even though I loved her dearly.

Not only that, but the models that participated were lied to and had no idea that this wasn’t real and was a “prank”.  This is exceptionally cruel.  Fat men’s bodies are not a joke.  So many fat people have trauma around the “jokes” that thin people like to play on us.  Thin people think it’s hilarious to pretend that they are romantically attracted to a fat person or that they want to be friends with a fat person. The punchline is- HA HA! You thought you were a person! But you’re not! LOL! These “pranks” leave scars, making it hard for their fat victims to believe anyone could ever care about them. These scars last for years, a lifetime.  That is what this “joke” reminded me of. A deep well of trauma from being subjected to the cruelties of thin people. Of humiliation and torment, over and over, for the sake of thin people’s “jokes”. I will not ever shop at an American Eagle again.  I stand in solidarity with fat men and masculine people.  Fat masculine bodies are not a joke.   WHAAHKJSNFKJA:BF:IEWBFKJSBDFLSBKFJBSLJFBSLKFBWLJEHFBS>DBSFBLSKEFHLSUKEHFK  I AM SO ANGRY.
