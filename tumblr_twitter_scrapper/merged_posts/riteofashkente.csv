ANYWAY their first kill is this guy named taylor. taylor is one of the girl’s boyfriends. it is heavily implied and the writer confirmed that he abuses and rapes her. not explicitly seen, but she has bruises, there are scenes implying it etc. so. she wrote the part where they kill taylor. and one of my professor’s comments was about how he felt like he didn’t hate taylor enough. to which me and my female friend were like um what?? we hate him. he fucking raped and abused her. wE HATE HIM. HE IS A HORRIBLE PERSON. and my prof was like well yeah i hate him but i don’t HATE hate him. and we argued about it. so he took a poll of who hated taylor. ALL of the girls in the class raised their hands. none of the boys did. when he asked who didn’t hate taylor all of the men raised their hands. and me and my friend started laughing because of COURSE they did. and my prof was like why are you laughing and the writer was like “i think they’re laughing at the gender difference in that answer” and my prof was like “well, from my male perspective, i don’t think i’m being sexist” WHAT. first of all did you hear that sentence at ALL do you understand how paradoxical it is????? second of all, no. just no. and then my prof went on to say “i feel like we need to see taylor be horrible. like bad solution, he kicks a dog” evidently a man can abuse and rape a girl and not be hated, but if he kicks a dog then he’s PURE EVIL and THAT is exactly what’s wrong with our society   " False text

I would get my ass pinched and I would smack them as hard as I could.  Who alway got in trouble? Me.  They would call my mother and she always came in and lectures my teachers and threatened to sue for making her miss work and treating me poorly.  She always taught my brothers to respect women. The only fights my brothers ever got in was defending women from someone else.  The school tried to call my father once instead of my mother on us. He came in in his full preacher outfit (being a preacher and all) and gave them an entire sermon on what would Jesus day of he was called in. They decided dealing with my mom was better.  I think my favorite story of this is when some kid snapped my bra and I turned around, didn’t even think about it, and punched that little motherfucker right in the nose. So naturally, I end up in the principal’s office, refusing to apologize.  “He shouldn’t have put his hands on me and I wouldn’t have hit him!” That’s the only thing I was saying. These people had the unfortunate luck of catching my dad at home, instead of my mom. So he comes fucking sauntering in there, like he’s Clint fucking Eastwood in some western movie and looks at me.  “Melissa, did you punch him?”  “Yes.” I said.  “Why?”  “Because he snapped my bra strap.”  And he turns his squinty eyed glare to the principal and says, “You’re telling me my daughter is in trouble because that squirrely looking kid put his hands on her and she chose to defend herself? That’s what you are saying to me.”  “Well, sir-” The man kind of stuttered because my dad is kind of intimidating in the quiet sort of way that kind of whispers in the back of your mind that this person could be dangerous. “Melissa did make it physical.”  “No. That kid put his hands on my daughter. Are you saying my daughter cannot defend herself when some boy decides to put hands on her? Is that what you are teaching my girl?”  I didn’t get suspended that day.    *slow clap for excellent parenting*  This is the parent I want to be omg " False text

Ben talking about the baby is hysterical. This article needed an editor!  Goodness.  Anyway, this is the first I’ve heard that the big reveal at the end of TST is specifically about John Watson.  That’s interesting.  I’m still thinking that John’s secret is some spy shit, which should be very interesting. Not to say that his sexuality will go unmentioned, but I think that Mofftiss will want to make the point that, yeah, he may not be straight (yikes!!!) but there’s much more to him than that.  @queerjawn, I agree.  I remember during setlock there were rumours of a scene filmed with just Martin and Ben in the MI-6 building.  So if John had been working with MI-5 or MI-6 ever since Sherlock was shot by Mary, and Sherlock didn’t know about it, that would be pretty big.  It would also help fill in a lot of holes in HLV. I feel like I’m jumping in (and everyone probably knows this already), but Mark has already written a bisexual spy - Lucifer Box in his series, it also has the best ‘coming out’ scene, if you will (as in the reader finds out he is bi scene), that anyone has probably ever written (also read them for Mark’s use of language, it’s divine, somewhat salacious and will make you think of Oscar Wilde). I feel like this is something that would make sense both narratively and in terms of Mofftiss’s style. As for John mirrors, Andrew West worked for MI6 (iirc, anyway, he was a secret agent in effect). I don’t think there have been any others, but MI6 and CIA have been more in the background so far (despite featuring rather heavily). I believe we will get a more intimate look into these institutions and its affairs - the filming at the MI6 building, the SWAT team (or an equivalent) from way back at the start of filming, “Mary” and John in the scenes filmed in Morocco, all the men in suits from both the trailers and the Moriarty scenes on the beach - the presence of intelligence agencies is around them constantly, so I think John’s involvement is very likely. Also I think this has been speculated since HLV aired, so someone has probably done a way more comprehensive meta than me on this ages ago." False link
