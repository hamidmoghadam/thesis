Cotton predominant only. or None, none works.  - Stop sleeping in draws.  - Stop putting soap in your vagina. Your vagina is self cleaning it just needs a rinse with water and a coochie only rag. Bath & body works and Summer’s eve are creating a Ph imbalance, which can cause odor and infection.  - Only use unscented products in the area surrounding your vagina.  - Pee after sex or masturbation, regardless of if you reached orgasm or not. - If you feel the urge to pee GO, If you don’t GO. DRINK WATER - I almost forgot but it’s extremely important.  Clear or white discharge is normal. If the colors change, go see a doctor.  *I think I’m gonna add to this daily.  The soap part is extremely hard for people.  Women think that because the soap has a nice smell it will make them smell like that. Nah we have our own smell and the man made smell of Country Apple will taint that.  I know  ✨The Gospel  The key to vaginal excellence  a small note about discharge because sometimes white discharge could be a sign of a yeast infection. just make sure you’re mindful of what’s normal for you and your vag  I do not care if this messes up my blog. This is important. For that case (on white discharge), it depends on the amount. My doctor told me this.  If it’s white or clear, you’re good. If it’s white, clumpy (cottage cheese like), has a bad smell & increased in usual amount, then it might be a problem. Make an appointment and get checked.  Now ladies, yeast is already present in your vagina, so it’s kind of unrealistic to get rid of all yeast. Too much yeast is not good. The goal is to reduce the over growth of yeast & get your vagina back to a healthy balance.  Treatments consists of, anti fungal agents in forms of tablets. I know. Some people can’t really swallow tablets or have a trouble swallowing tablets. I feel you baby, I have the same problem. You can also use vaginal creams. Over the counter treatments are available, however, if you are pregnant, please, make sure any medications are approved by your doctor. You should get medications approved regardless, but if you’re pregnant, MAKE SURE you check back with your doctor.  Also, yeast infections are not commonly transmitted during sex and partners are not usually treated, unless they show signs. As in, itching or irritation in their genital area. Treatment for male partners consists of fungicidal cream on the penis.  Sometimes you might be a little unbalanced & that’s okay, just make sure you get to your Doctor & get on making yourself healthy again.  Some prevention and treatment guidelines for vaginal infections: Have new partners wear condoms during sexual intercourse.  Stay healthy; eat well, get enough sleep, drink enough fluids.  Keep vaginal area clean and dry.  ALWAYS wipe from front to back after urination or bowel movement. You should know why. You don’t want no bacteria going all in your vagina.  Avoid using deodorant pads or tampons.  Don’t use petroleum jelly or other oils for lubricants.  Don’t douche.  Use medication as long as directed.  Avoid sexual intercourse until treatment is completed and you are symptom free.  Don’t scratch infected or inflamed areas; it can cause further irritation.  If using medication inside the vagina, use it during the menstrual period.  During an infection, use pads rather than tampons if menstruation occurs.  Avoid vulvo/vaginal irritants, including perfumed or deodorant soaps/body washes.  If symptoms persist after completing the treatment, an exam is indicated. Call for an appointment, and please use nothing in the vagina for 48 hours prior to your exam.  Get/stay healthy ladies. I love you. Also, my doctor told me to stop shaving earlier this month when I went to go see her. Pubic hair grows there for a reason. It’s not meant for you to shave off. It’s their to protect you. Yes, you can trim it. But don’t shave it all, or constantly shave. Giving yourself a fresh shave here and there is fine. But keep in mind that hair grows their for a reason. This is for women & men. If someone complains about your hairs, punch them in the neck. (Not literally) But, understand that they’re childish & they don’t deserve the cookie or magic stick anyways. God bless & Happy Holidays.  raw cranberry juice (tastes like beet juice but can be diluted with water and unbleached sugar to help the taste) and probiotics like the ones that are in yogurt are also good for urinary and sexual health. 😊   Keep it right ladies 🙌🏾  Ladies 💁🏽💁🏽  For the ladies that follow me. Take care of yourselves  For people with vaginas.  Also it seems like, the older you get the more sensitive it becomes to soap etc.  I had to stop using soap and panty liners all together to try to avoid yeast infections. I’ve found thick cotton panties, like Hanes or fruit of the loom boy shorts work best. The absorb the most.  The 5 five for 25 panties aren’t going to do shit for you if you are heavy discharge person most of the time.  I cosign on the cotton boy shorts if you have a lot of discharge! They’re cuter than granny panties. Also cotton thongs from VS are a blessing. If you use soap, only use Dove, and only a little bit on your vulva NOWHERE ELSE. Drink lots of water. Fun fact: unhealthy semen can fuck up your pH balance, as well as unprotected sex in general.   reblogging as a fan of healthy vaginas.   I, too, support healthy vaginas, take care of yourself ladies  Who puttin regular soap on they cootie cat. Are yall not burning?  ALSO STOP DOUCHING YOUR CUCHIE. STOP USING THAT SUMMERS EVE BS.

We know that we gather this afternoon on indigenous land and we follow the lead of the first peoples who despite massive genocidal violence have never relinquished the struggle for land, water, culture, their people. We especially salute today the Standing Rock Sioux. “The freedom struggles of black people that have shaped the very nature of this country’s history cannot be deleted with the sweep of a hand. We cannot be made to forget that black lives do matter. This is a country anchored in slavery and colonialism, which means for better or for worse the very history of the United States is a history of immigration and enslavement. Spreading xenophobia, hurling accusations of murder and rape and building walls will not erase history. “No human being is illegal. “The struggle to save the planet, to stop climate change, to guarantee the accessibility of water from the lands of the Standing Rock Sioux, to Flint, Michigan, to the West Bank and Gaza. The struggle to save our flora and fauna, to save the air—this is ground zero of the struggle for social justice. “This is a women’s march and this women’s march represents the promise of feminism as against the pernicious powers of state violence. And inclusive and intersectional feminism that calls upon all of us to join the resistance to racism, to Islamophobia, to anti-Semitism, to misogyny, to capitalist exploitation. “Yes, we salute the fight for 15. We dedicate ourselves to collective resistance. Resistance to the billionaire mortgage profiteers and gentrifiers. Resistance to the health care privateers. Resistance to the attacks on Muslims and on immigrants. Resistance to attacks on disabled people. Resistance to state violence perpetrated by the police and through the prison industrial complex. Resistance to institutional and intimate gender violence, especially against trans women of color. “Women’s rights are human rights all over the planet and that is why we say freedom and justice for Palestine. We celebrate the impending release of Chelsea Manning. And Oscar López Rivera. But we also say free Leonard Peltier. Free Mumia Abu-Jamal. Free Assata Shakur. “Over the next months and years we will be called upon to intensify our demands for social justice to become more militant in our defense of vulnerable populations. Those who still defend the supremacy of white male hetero-patriarchy had better watch out. “The next 1,459 days of the Trump administration will be 1,459 days of resistance: Resistance on the ground, resistance in the classrooms, resistance on the job, resistance in our art and in our music. “This is just the beginning and in the words of the inimitable Ella Baker, ‘We who believe in freedom cannot rest until it comes.’ Thank you.” " False link

I had to give a ten minute presentation on gender and a) how it’s different from sex, and b) whether or not there’s such thing as a “male” and “female” brain. I found COUNTLESS studies supporting the idea that the brain itself is unisex- there is very little, if any, difference between “male” and “female” brains, with one exception. I’m by no means a neuroscientist but this is what I understood from this particular article: there’s this tiny part of the hypothalamus (a small part of the brain) that has neutrons in it, and the number of neutrons varies. HOWEVER, when the brains of cis men and women and trans men and women (who had not taken hormones for years prior to the time of death) were studied, it was found that the cis men and trans men had almost identical average neutron counts, and the cis women and trans women had almost identical average neutron counts. So if you’re DMAB but realize at some point that you’re a trans woman, as far as your brain is concerned, you ARE a woman! The same goes for DFAB trans men (intersex/nonbinary individuals weren’t studied, unfortunately). TLDR; Your brain doesn’t care what you were “born as”, only what you really are!  I’m currently reading a fantastic book that goes through and debunks old studies that “find evidence” to support gender roles. SPOILER ALERT: they were all poorly done studies and their evidence is unsupported bullshit.  what is the book??!  i’m willing to bet the book in question is Delusions of Gender by Cordelia Fine, which is incredibly well-researched book and a delight to read.  Although, by like halfway through the book you’ll develop a deep-seated urge to punch social gender roles in the metaphorical face. Unless you already had that, as many of us do. " False link

Cho led public conversations online about how Asian-Americans are whitewashed in media earlier this year after the controversy erupted, and apparently she also had private conversations with Swinton herself. “Tilda eventually emailed me and she said that she didn’t understand why people were so mad about Doctor Strange and she wanted to talk about it, and wanted to get my take on why all the Asian people were mad,” Cho tells Bobby Lee on his podcast TigerBelly. “It was so weird.” Lee joked, “You are the president of all Asians: American division.” “I don’t have a yellow phone under a cake dome!” Cho laughed. Strangely enough, Swinton initially got into contact with Cho through Alex Bornstein. “She hooked us up. Which is the most ironic,” Cho said, referencing Bornstein’s infamous Asian-ish nail-salon owner character Ms. Swan during her days on MADtv. “'Is it cool if I give Tilda your number because she wants to talk to you?’ And I go all right.” Cho and Swinton had a “long discussion,” after which Swinton told Cho not to “tell anybody.” “It was a long fight about why the part should not have gone to her. That’s what I thought: The part should not have gone to her,” said Cho. “We’d fight about it and basically it ended with her saying, ‘Well I’m producing a movie and Steven Yeun is starring.‘” (This is no doubt a reference to Bong Joon-ho’s upcoming film Okja in which Swinton stars with Yeun.) “Oh, like I have a black friend,” Lee joked. “It was weird because I felt like a house Asian, like I’m her servant,” Cho said. “Like the ones when they have in the raj, they would have the house servant who was your confidante … The servant that was close to you. That’s sort of what I felt like, like I was following her with an umbrella. I had a weird feeling about the entire exchange, especially the part of Don’t tell anybody.” The conversation began because Cho and Lee were talking about navigating an industry where there were no other people like them. “The fact is we’re not given roles that are worthy of us,” Cho said. “We’re constantly having to wade through and do what we can.”  SW: And the truth comes out.

But it’s all part of their day job. Tammie Baird is Hollywood’s go-to stuntwoman for car hits. She’s appeared in Fast & Furious, Chris Brown’s Next 2 You music video, and NCIS: LA. She’s been smashed into windshields, bounced off bonnets and slammed into the tarmac – more often than not wearing a tight dress and heels. When Baird got her first role, in Mr & Mrs Smith, she went shopping for stunt gear “like a guy”. “I bought the biggest, bulkiest pads, and thought, ‘Yeah, I’m protected, nothing’s gonna get me.’ Then I saw my wardrobe – I was wearing a miniskirt.”  Friendly reminder that stuff like unrealistic female armor actually tangibly hurts women " False link

Abrams, the director behind Star Wars: The Force Awakens, confirmed that there would be openly gay characters in future franchise installments, according to The Daily Beast. During a pre-Oscars event at his Bad Robot HQ in Los Angeles, Abrams said said that he wants Star Wars to be a more inclusive universe, then referenced LGBTQ community. “To me, the fun of Star Wars is the glory of possibility,” Abrams said. “So it seems insanely narrow-minded and counterintuitive to say there wouldn’t be a homosexual character in that world.” WhenThe Force Awakens was released, one of the most popular fan-paired couples to come out of it was between Finn and Poe. Fans have made it clear that they’re more than open to the idea of having an openly gay character in the films. Now according to Abrams, it’s just a matter of time until one officially appears.

For Captain America: Civil War, this was the moment they filmed an epic throwdown between two teams of heroes: the forces of Chris Evans’s red, white, and blue soldier on one side, clashing against the warriors aligned with Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man on the other. The 2006-07 Marvel Comics series that inspired the movie, which opens May 6, explores the same enduring question of freedom versus safety. In the Mark Millar-scripted comics, hero turned against hero as some resisted government control of their identities and abilities while others sought compliance and regulation for the greater good. Captain America stood for independence from government control, while Iron Man worked to legislate and enforce responsibility on those with “enhanced abilities.” “In most of the movies, there’s no question who we should be siding with,” Evans says during a break between shots. “We all agree Nazis are bad, aliens from space are bad. But this movie’s the first time where you really have two points of view. There’s really no wrong answer here and it’s just a matter of who we are as men: Tony Stark and myself. Which side of the aisle do we come down on? So it’s hard for [Cap]. It becomes a question of morality and I don’t think he’s ever been so uncertain with what right and wrong is.” In this film, the new Avengers — seen assembling at the end of Age of Ultron — take on an old enemy: Frank Grillo’s Crossbones, last spotted getting a building dropped on his skull in 2013’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier. But… the takedown goes wrong. A lot of people die. A lot of innocent ones. After all the chaos and catastrophe witnessed in the previous films, the world finally has had enough. Government officials from around the globe assemble to enact accords that would clamp down on those with super-human skills. One man helping form the new laws is a young leader named T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman) from the fictional African nation of Wakanda, who has a secret identity himself — the long awaited Black Panther. But Cap has seen too much corrupt authority in his (unnaturally) long life. He ain’t marching anymore. On this already broiling July morning in Fayetteville, Georgia, Evans is sweating through his Cap mask as he shoots the Splash Page — this culmination of the conflict over the accords. He’s standing at the end of a flat expanse of asphalt, ringed with two-story green tarps that will allow special-effects artists to transform this Pinewood Studios parking lot into a tarmac at Leipzig/Halle International Airport. Sebastian Stan’s Winter Soldier, Steve Rogers’ long-lost friend and principle foe in the last Cap movie, is standing at his left. “Had Bucky not been brainwashed he’d be doing the same thing Cap is doing, taking orders from S.H.I.E.L.D. and fighting for the country and then realizing S.H.I.E.L.D. is corrupt,” Evans says. “But Bucky’s a different situation. He obviously couldn’t make these choices. This is — I don’t want to give too much about the plot away but Bucky’s a big piece of the puzzle in this movie just because it gives Steve something that he really hasn’t had besides Peggy, but even Peggy is well on in her life.” That would be Peggy Carter, known as Agent Carter to fans of the ABC television series, which chronicles the life of Hayley Atwell’s character as a covert agent in post-World War II America. In The Winter Soldier, Rogers visits with his old flame, who at that point was a frail, elderly woman struggling with dementia at the end of a long, daring life. Apart from Peggy, Rogers only has one connection left to his old self. “No one on this planet knew him then. No one is left,” Evans says. “He doesn’t have any peace with his youth. He doesn’t have any peace from his life, so Bucky and whatever happens with Bucky in this movie…” Evans trails off. “That’s a big piece in terms of him kind of finding his own purpose in what he’s fighting for and how that friendship can come back to life. Not just them as soldiers, but them as friends.” There are other familiar heroes aligned alongside Cap and Bucky (mild spoiler warning): Anthony Mackie’s Falcon, Paul Rudd’s Ant-Man (although today it’s a stunt double in the mask), Elizabeth Olsen’s Scarlet Witch, and Jeremy Renner’s Hawkeye. Leading the opposite side is… nobody. Iron Man and Don Cheadle’s War Machine will be flying toward them, so they’ll be added digitally later. But an equally impressive team of iconic characters is arrayed alongside him, preparing to face down Cap and Co.: Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow and Black Panther (also a stunt double) among them. Directors Joe and Anthony Russo yell action — and that’s what’s unleashed. The good-guys charge each other in a savage beat-down. “The story is about family. And what happens if they don’t agree,” says Joe Russo, who directed the previous Cap film, The Winter Soldier, with his brother. “We’ve been comparing it to a fight at a wedding. What happens when your cousin and your brother go at it, and whose side are you on, and where does it go from there?” “How do you move forward from a moment where people who used to love each other and were on the same side, now hate each other and are trying to hurt each other?” Anthony Russo adds. “[Cap is] such a strong, grounded, morally centered, ethically centered character. You can beat at him pretty hard as a hero, to try to crack that strength — both morally and physically.” Iron Man definitely tries. While Black Widow gives an all-out thrashing to Ant-Man, Hawkeye and Scarlet Witch blast away at the sky — him with his trusty bow and arrows, her with her mystical red energy pulses. They’re trying to knock some unseen threat out of the air. (It’s hard to tell which visual effect they’re imagining.) It’s definitely not Iron Man. He’s flying low and locked onto another target: Captain America. Evans raises his shield, slings an upper cut through the air, and gets in one more hit against his invisible foe before he’s almost taken out in real life. The main camera is on a crane, and it swoops down on the battle scene — following Iron Man’s descent — until it’s right in Evans’s face. The actor has to dive out of the way at the last second to avoid being clobbered. After a few more takes, Evans comes over to the video screens to check out the shot, laughing at the fact that each one ends with an extreme close-up of his panicked face, dodging the camera. “I can’t keep throwing punches when that’s so close,” he says. The Russos come up with a solution: Go ahead and drop back. The shot will end with Iron Man knocking Captain America to his knees. But he’s not going to stay there.

Ava DuVernay of Selma fame will direct Chadwick Boseman in Black Panther, Marvel’s first minority-led superhero movie.The DuVernay choice is great news for the future of the Marvel franchise not only because of the more diverse perspective she can bring to the table (she’d be the first non-white, non-male director to see a Marvel film to its completion), but also because in hiring someone with such strong vision, Marvel can combat accusations that its lucrative franchise is a creatively stifling place for directors. In the past, Marvel has employed a wide-range of creative directorial talents from Kenneth Branagh and Shane Black toJon Favreau and Joss Whedon. But it’s only been a year since Edgar Wright left the studio’s Ant-Man, a project he had been developing for the better part of a decade, over creative differences and just a few months since Whedon sounded off with remarkable candor about the “really unpleasant” storytelling battles he lost in making Avengers: Age of Ultron."
