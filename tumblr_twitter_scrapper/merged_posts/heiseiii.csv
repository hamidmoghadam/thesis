You know, both of them were the weak link in the friend group, the guy easily influenced. But instead, Rowling made Neville weak to prove the two paths an individual could take. How each of our weaknesses manifest in different ways. Peter’s weakness made him a villain, ultimately worse than Voldemort because he betrayed his friends, while Neville’s weakness made him work harder and in the end made him Harry’s strongest ally.  Harry = James, Ron = Sirius, Hermione = Remus, Neville = Peter, Ginny = Lily, Luna = Snape.  You will notice that none of the six from the old generation survived. The kids each have traits from the old generation but they’re here to fix the past, and thus must survive the series to metaphorically right the past. Some may raise their eyebrows at Luna as Snape, but just as Harry represents James (the popular kid who was good at quidditch, but didn’t become arrogant like his father) or like Peter and Neville (two people who could have been cowards, but Neville rises to life’s challenges) Luna mirrors Snape in being mocked, a pariah, Looney Lovegood and Snivellus. Instead of being resentful, she rose above it, and loved herself regardless.  If you went with Harry to the Ministry of Magic in book 5, you mattered beyond just backing him up against Voldemort. This core six represented the loss and failure of the Marauders generation, and the hopes of a post-Voldemort future.    Holy shit " False text

Adult men automatically assume that I have loud opinions and will talk back to them (they are correct and have learned from experience), but children compliment me all the time.  i feel like in myths goddesses and fairies already have that relationship trope with men and children  Confirming the blue hair thing here. Kids think I’m magical, old ladies often go “oh, I wish I’d had your courage”, old men glare at me like I have two heads, and then glare at my father like somehow they expect him to control his unruly 33 year old.It’s awesome.  Pair it with glitter and winged eyeliner and the effect is about 200% stronger. Speaking from experience.  100% me and @mermaidqueen  The amount I want to try this now is 400% what it was before.  Friend, I’m gunna tell you this right now, DO IT. Take. The. Leap. Your hair will always grow out and can be re-dyed if you hate it. I started dyeing my hair red in high school and haven’t looked back.   When I had blue hair I never got catcalled, when it happened fairly regularly where I was at the time. I got dirty looks a few times, but mostly people either afraid to actually look at me, children staring in amazement, people whispering where they thought I wouldn’t notice (mostly children to parents), or people coming up and complimenting me.  One man stopped a conversation he was having on his phone to compliment me twice in a store. First he was like, “woah! I love your hair!” and told his friend about it, then he stopped again when we crossed aisles again and was saying, “I just can’t get over how pretty that color looks! And it matches your eyes! That’s amazing! Have a good one!” Another guy stopped me on campus to tell me it was his favorite color and he has shoes that match and maybe he should dye his hair too. Just the most innocent compliments that usually women only get from other women.  Men who don’t like it are going to be too afraid of you to say anything, because if you are bold enough to have bright blue hair, you’re bold enough to tell them off.  i’ve had blue, purple, and pink hair. this is definitely all true. old ladies and little kids love it, bitter grown men look at you like you’re the devil.
