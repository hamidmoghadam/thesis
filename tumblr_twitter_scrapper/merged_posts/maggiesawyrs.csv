I think that’s an important thread for the show, but I also appreciate that Cat pointed it out for us. Supergirl is about hope. She’s not about killing. And so is this show. For so many hero stories now, death feels so inevitable, and it’s so refreshing to have this show, that makes such a point of something that a lot of comics used to be about. Comics used to always tell stories about heroes that refused to kill or let people be killed, and I’m so so pleased that Supergirl chose to adhere to that idea so obviously. In doing that, they truly made Supergirl about hope, like Cat said, and such joyous hope is oddly hard to come by on television these days. Thia got some more notes yesterday and for clarification I would just like to say I am pro killing Mon el and also his pussy ass shouldve shot his mother " False text
