This isn’t having a short attention span (or well maybe thats part of it), but probably something called “Optimal Arousal.”(This is psychology, not anatomy, please keep your mind out of the gutter Xp) Optimal Arousal goes like this: When effort is low, more stimulus is better. When effort is high, less stimulus is better.  I’ll elaborate. Whenever you do something easy (like maybe some homework as an example), unless something else is happening (like music or a show) you tend to get drawn away or doze off. In this homework scenario, the effort is low, so in order to keep at it and do well on working on it, you need a higher amount of stimulus, like a movie. If something is hard, like for instance a test, you probably will try to avoid noise, going so far as to hush others so you can concentrate. The effort is high so you want less stimulus. Keep this in mind. It can help you focus, and make life a lot easier. Dont feel bad for doing lots of different things while you are just chillin. Enjoy the knowledge! " False text

If being ace won’t get you kicked out of your home, you won’t need housing. If being ace won’t get you fired, you won’t need the financial backup. If being ace doesn’t put you at physical risk, you won’t need the protective services that the LGBT community can muster. If, on the other hand, being ace does cause you to deal with any of the above, then the resources aren’t being ‘wasted’ – they’re going toward the safety and well-being of somebody who’s being punished for not being straight. Isn’t that the point of those resources to begin with? I’m honestly confused how this argument even works. The only way it makes sense is if we’re walking up to a community that we have zero need of, and they’re just going ‘okey-dokey! 8D’ and handing us shit we clearly don’t need. Is that what y’all are trying to say? I’m honestly curious.  the more I see this contradiction, the more it bothers me. I constantly see BOTH “aces dont get kicked out of their homes!! ace people dont get murdered!!!” and “cishet aces/aros are stealing resources made by and for LGBT people!!!” Which is it? How are they taking these resources if they don’t need them? cishet aces/aros aren’t getting kicked out of their homes but theyre also taking up LGBT shelters?  The only thing I can think of that would include “aces take resources” and “aces don’t get kicked out of homes/fired/raped/abused for being ace” is information resources, and that doesn’t make sense either. How is it bad to have a greater understanding of human sexuality?like, if a confused young person has questions about their sexuality, they are going to go to an LGBT group (no matter what it’s called) and ask questions. At that point, they are Questioning. How would it help anybody if the young person asks about not really feeling attraction? to anyone? I guess? and then told that they’re basically straight, go away you are taking up resources!

And this belief can be so strong, they can sometimes follow that belief up with a false confession. Early last year, a team of lawyers and statisticians published a paper stating that 4.1 percent of criminal defendants who are sentenced to death in the US are falsely convicted. To investigate this phenomenon, a study led by psychological scientist Julia Shaw from the University of Bedfordshire in the UK investigated the possible cause, and found that, if questioned in the right way, innocent people can fabricate stories in their minds with so much detail, they can falsely convince themselves that they committed a crime. “Our findings show that false memories of committing crime with police contact can be surprisingly easy to generate, and can have all the same kinds of complex details as real memories,” Shaw said in a press release. “All participants need to generate a richly detailed false memory is three hours in a friendly interview environment, where the interviewer introduces a few wrong details and uses poor memory-retrieval techniques.” …  [everyone who’s ever been gaslighted, in unison] “You don’t say!” " False link

We have entered a phase of regression,and one of the easiest ways to see it is in our infrastructure: our roads and bridges look more like those in Thailand or Venezuela than the Netherlands or Japan. But it goes far deeper than that, which is why Temin uses a famous economic model created to understand developing nations to describe how far inequality has progressed in the United States. The model is the work of West Indian economist W. Arthur Lewis, the only person of African descent to win a Nobel Prize in economics.  In the Lewis model of a dual economy, much of the low-wage sector has little influence over public policy. Check.  The high-income sector will keep wages down in the other sector to provide cheap labor for its businesses. Check.  Social control is used to keep the low-wage sector from challenging the policies favored by the high-income sector. Mass incarceration - check.  The primary goal of the richest members of the high-income sector is to lower taxes. Check.  Social and economic mobility is low. Check. Temin says that today in the U.S., the ticket out is education, which is difficult for two reasons: you have to spend money over a long period of time, and the FTE sector is making those expenditures more and more costly by defunding public schools and making policies that increase student debt burdens.   Even with a diploma, you will likely find that high-paying jobs come from networks of peers and relatives. Social capital, as well as economic capital, is critical, but because of America’s long history of racism and the obstacles it has created for accumulating both kinds of capital, black graduates often can only find jobs in education, social work, and government instead of higher-paying professional jobs like technology or finance— something most white people are not really aware of. Women are also held back by a long history of sexism and the burdens — made increasingly heavy — of making greater contributions to the unpaid care economy and lack of access to crucial healthcare. How did we get this way? What happened to America’s middle class, which rose triumphantly in the post-World War II years, buoyed by the GI bill, the victories of labor unions, and programs that gave the great mass of workers and their families health and pension benefits that provided security? Around 1970, the productivity of workers began to get divided from their wages. Corporate attorney and later Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell galvanized the business community to lobby vigorously for its interests. Johnson’s War on Poverty was replaced by Nixon’s War on Drugs, which sectioned off many members of the low-wage sector, disproportionately black, into prisons. Politicians increasingly influenced by the FTE sector turned from public-spirited universalism to free-market individualism. As money-driven politics accelerated (a phenomenon explained by the Investment Theory of Politics, as Temin explains), leaders of the FTE sector became increasingly emboldened to ignore the needs of members of the low-wage sector, or even to actively work against them.  Temin notes that “the desire to preserve the inferior status of blacks has motivated policies against all members of the low-wage sector.” What can we do? We’ve been digging ourselves into a hole for over forty years, but Temin says that we know how to stop digging.  If we spent more on domestic rather than military activities, then the middle class would not vanish as quickly.  The effects of technological change and globalization could be altered by political actions.  We could restore and expand education, shifting resources from policies like mass incarceration to improving the human and social capital of all Americans.  We could upgrade infrastructure, forgive mortgage and educational debt in the low-wage sector,  reject the notion that private entities should replace democratic government in directing society, and  focus on embracing an integrated American population.  We could tax not only the income of the rich, but also their capital.   We have a structure that predetermines winners and losers. We are not getting the benefits of all the people who could contribute to the growth of the economy, to advances in medicine or science which could improve the quality of life for everyone — including some of the rich people.” Along with Thomas Piketty, whose Capital in the Twenty-First Century examines historical and modern inequality, Temin’s book has provided a giant red flag, illustrating a trajectory that will continue to accelerate as long as the 20 percent in the FTE sector are permitted to operate a country within America’s borders solely for themselves at the expense of the majority.  Without a robust middle class, America is not only reverting to developing-country status, it is increasingly ripe for serious social turmoil that has not been seen in generations. In Other Words Revolution  Capitalism’s bad  “We have a structure that predetermines winners and losers.” " False link

Police can force you to place your fingerprint on your phone but they cannot force you to enter in the passcode.  Refuse all requests/demands to open your phone unless you are presented with a warrant.  - Bring a valid government issued photo ID that has your name., address, and  date of birth on it.

In some states, asking the first time requires the police to stop interrogation.  In other states, you may have to ask more than once.

One person said, “Often I have the words in my mind, I have perfect understanding, but it’s as though they need to move from my mind into my mouth and I can’t get them to do it.” This is an exact description of verbal dyspraxia. It’s a disconnect between the brain and the mouth. Verbal dyspraxia always explains some 70 - 90% of all discussions I see between partially/sometimes non-verbal autistic people of what they experience. So the thing is, the medical community DOES have a name, a word, and an understanding of the ability to talk sometimes and the inability to talk at other times. The problem is the history of the autism diagnosis. As soon as you put that particular label on someone, all other explanations for behavior and experiences get pushed aside in favor of the “mysterious inexplicable behavioral emotional social disease” that so many people still hang on to believing autism is.  But we have something. We have terms. We have words. They are incredibly powerful things to have. More and more autistic people are coming to understand that they have C-APD and that is wonderful. It’s important to have that word, to know. And yet still, something that looms so large in the life of so many autistic people, understanding why sometimes speech is so hard, is being denied to us, even though an explanation, a word, an understanding exists.  It’s just one component of many as to why conversations become hard for autistic people (C-APD being another) but it is a huge, key one and we shouldn’t be denied knowing the words for our own experiences. It makes me so sad.  " False link

NEVER engage the perpetrator. He (and it is usually he) is looking for confrontation. Instead speak to the person he is abusing. Say hello. Introduce yourself. Shake his or her hand. And just stand with them. Keep talking. About anything. Weather. Bus schedules. Football. This kind of bullying never works against a group of people having a conversation. Usually a single person travelling or a mom with a kid or maximum, two women are targeted. Form a group of people with and around them if you can. Don’t tell them they are not alone. Just don’t let them be alone. I speak from experience. Once, I encountered a young girl wearing a hijab being abused as a terrorist by a drunk man on a train. I just went and sat beside her and started a conversation with her. After a while, the dude lost interest. I had a lovely chat with a young student from Qatar. She wanted to study literature while her dad was only prepared to pay for engineering or commerce as he wanted her to join the family business. It helped her feel safe and it expanded my horizons.  This is known in behavioral psychology as “non-complimentary behavior”; by not fueling the aggression of another person and you can flip the whole script of all their expectations, and without any footholds for their aggression (like direct provocation and confrontation/conflict) to launch into further tirades against, the aggressor can’t continue their angry scene-building. The more people who participate in script-flipping, the more successful it gets, as in this post you see with the advice to form a protective group between the bigot and their target for that very purpose. There’s an NPR podcast called Invisibilia which goes into detail about how it works and what sort of people rely on it everyday professionally and for survival alike, in their Flipping the Script episode.  Ooohhhh  In light of the many posts I’ve already seen about people being attacked with racial and xenophobic slurs in our (ugh) president-elect’s name, it seems like a good time to reblog this post.  If you see someone being abused or attacked, and you feel you can SAFELY do so, ignore the perpetrator and speak to the person they’re abusing. Just go stand by them, say hello, tell them you like their shirt, ask what they have planned for the day, anything to let them know they’re not alone. Even better if you can get other people to do this with you.  Remember: talk to the person being abused; do NOT engage the bully. And stay safe, everyone. <3  reblogged  REBLOG TO POTENTIALLY SAVE A LIFE!!!!!!!  seriously works - I helped prevent a hate crime by talking about ice cream flavors. Five other people joined in.

Justin Trudeau and his Liberal government campaigned on a long to-do list for Indigenous voters and they cast ballots in unprecedented numbers. One year later, some say those promises rang empty and the new Liberal government has failed them. “He hasn’t fulfilled a single promise that he made to First Nations,” says Pamela Palmater, an associate professor and chair of Indigenous Governance at Ryerson University. “Harper was the ultimate arch-villain of First Nations and Prime Minister Trudeau came in and he was all about the photo-ops and shaking hands and attending chiefs assemblies and sending his ministers out to meet with chiefs across the country. And that’s great, the symbolic part, but that’s all we have.” So far, Indigenous Canadians are no better off under the Liberal government, she tells Yahoo Canada News. The inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women is less than was promised and, despite claims to the contrary, the actual annual funding announced in the federal budget is within the two per cent cap, she says. An extra $50 million a year for four years toward post-secondary education has not materialized, either, Palmater says. Nor is there any plan of funding committed to implementing the 94 recommendations that emerged from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission report, she adds. “You can’t do that in a year, but he’s got no plan or budget in place and he didn’t even mention that in his budget,” she says. The Liberals promised to implement the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People, but now say that is not legally feasible, Palmater says. And the federal government has yet to abide by a Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruling in January that found the federal government discriminates against Indigenous children by under-funding child and family services on reserves.

Because seriously – there are so many stories lately about cis men playing trans women, and so many people saying that any man who gets cast as a trans woman should turn down the role. SO, let’s talk about Adam Lambert, and how he did that. He was offered the lead role of Frank-n-Furter in the new Rocky Horror production and he turned it down. And then, the showrunners responded by a) casting Laverne Cox instead, and b) giving Lambert a different role in the show anyway. In the end, everybody did the right thing and everybody got something good out of it.  I know Rocky Horror in general is a pretty touchy subject, with people having both extremely positive and extremely negative experiences with it, but let’s still acknowledge that some things are going very, very right in this production.  " False link
