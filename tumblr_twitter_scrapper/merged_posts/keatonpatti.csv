One year I was a step ahead of  her and dressed up as that mummy, so when she went to touch me I grabbed  her hand and said, “Don’t touch the mumm-ME!” and laughed and laughed.  She didn’t think it was very funny though and had a big heart attack and  died on the spot. I didn’t want to get in trouble so I threw her into  one of the empty mummy sarcophagi.

I say  shop, but it was more of a me just holding a sign that said “ICE CREAm”  (I never learned how to do a capital M)” than a shop. Regardless, it  became quite successful due to my oddly creative flavors (vanilla,  chocolate, The Tonight Dough starring Jimmy Fallon). One day a big ice  cream company tried to buy me out. They drove up in big limo, rolled  down the window, and tossed a big pile of cash at my feet. It was  windy so all the money flew away. They drove around and gathered it  back up and then threw a sealed bag of the money at my feet. By then it  was really windy so the bag flew away. They drove around and picked up  the bag and then just yelled at me through the window, “We’ll give you  $10,000 to just go away.” However, the wind was so bad by then that what  I heard was “We’ll (WRRRRRR) you (WRRRRRRR) go (WRRRRRR) you’re gay  (WRRRRRRRRRRRR).” I was going to respond, but I was blown away by the  wind, all my ice cream swirling around me, my sign flapping like one of  those animals with wings (birds? Is that right?). I eventually landed on  the Goodyear blimp, which I found out isn’t actually a blimp, just a  fat balloon. That was the best summer of my life, and that’s saying a  lot, because I’m now remembering it happened in the fall.  " True text

However, I did also notice ya got with ya a set of  lockpicking tools, like ya gonna need to break into the graveyard since  it’s after hours. Something a graverobber would do.” “I gave my set  of keys to a poor little old lady who wished to visit her husband’s  grave whenever the whim struck her.

Hahah! You thought this could’ve been  the set of a TV show? Are you fucking dense? Have you seen a TV show  set? Guess not because you’re such a fucking moron. Hahahhahaahh!

I walk past a gym every day!” “Mel, you can’t carry a tune, let alone a 500 pound jukebox.” “Damn, that was good.” “Thank you. I was hoping you’d mention trying to steal the jukebox so I could use it.” “Well I’ll leave now, but could I at least have a free drink before I go?” “Sure, what do you want?” “A bottle of acid that can melt a jukebox.”  The two shared a laugh over that. The jukebox didn’t laugh. The jukebox  only got angry and planned how to kill every human being on Earth. Some  say it’s still planning to this day, and if you listen closely when  that jukebox is playing Kings of Leon’s “Sex On Fire,” you can hear it  planning, but nobody ever has because when that song is playing  everybody’s too focused on ROCKING THE FUCK OUT!!!!!!!

I wish.” “Well, the firewood’s for the children’s camp I volunteer at. We tell ghost stories around the campfire.”  “About French ghosts, I’m sure. But you wouldn’t be telling the ghost  stories in order to unlock past life knowledge in the children, perhaps a  past life as a murderer or executioner, in order to have the children  kill you once the story is finished, would you?

How’d he do it?” “He went the ghost story route too.” “Always works.” “100% of the time.” “Never failed.” “Not once.” “Well once it failed.” “Nope.” “You’re right, I was just testing you.” “I’m gonna call you Mr. SAT, because you test people.” “Thanks. I’ve never had a name.”  The man left without any rope, but with a big smile on his face thanks  to the encounter with the cashier.
