If you’re struggling to pronounce my name, here’s how it goes:  uh-le(here pretend that you’re French)-nuh, but if you still don’t feel  comfortable, you can just call me Eileen, I like this name a lot! I live in a beautiful city called Moscow. It’s my second year in  university, and hopefully I’m going to become a professor of French. I  love languages, and I want to learn as many as I can in my life. Besides  French and English, I’m currently learning Spanish, but I’m only a  beginner in this one. I’m also really interested in cinematography, and  maybe one day I’ll film something myself, but for now it’s only a dream.  I like travelling, if I have money, but it doesn’t happen very often.  I’m looking for someone to practice English with and maybe French too,  although I don’t feel as comfortable talking and writing in it as in  English. And if you want to practice Russian, feel free to write me! I  love discussing various topics and listening to different opinions. I  believe that friends, just like a good movie or book, should provoke  each other to thoughts and inspire each other to self-improve and to  learn and discover new things.  I would prefer to talk online, but snail mail is okay too, I guess. Now  I’m gonna stop talking about myself or else I won’t have anything to  talk about with you later!Preferences: someone around my age, 16-24 maybe, any gender  " True text
