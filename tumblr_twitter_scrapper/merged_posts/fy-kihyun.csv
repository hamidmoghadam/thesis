(tentative title)’ When you listen to the song, it feels like spring itself. Playmode is an artist who really helped me musically. Another song is ‘How About You,’ from our recent album. It was written by Wonho and is a good song that also has a spring vibe.”© Soompi " True text

During the April 7 episode of “Singing Battle,” Kihyun appeared as a “hidden card” singer for Park Kyung Lim‘s team and faced off against comedian Kim Hak Do from Lee Sang Min’s team.  “The only thing I have is energy. I will perform with the energy I had back in my rookie days,” Kihyun declared.  The other guests on the show compared the ages of Kihyun and his opponent Kim Hak Do, shocked by the fact that Kihyun was a 93-liner while Kim Hak Do had debuted in the year 1993. The panelists worried about whether Kihyun would be able to pull off Kim Hyun Sik’s “Love Love Love,” a song that had been released before he was even born.  Kihyun, however, instantly turned their worries into awe. He effortlessly showcased his powerful vocals and made the audience forget about any generation gaps. In the end, he won the battle by a landslide with a score of twelve to one. Check out his performance here!© Soompi" True text

Although it was a minor collision we plan on going to the hospital right away to check for any side effects if they feel any pain.”  MONSTA X has left for Jeju Island for Mnet’s special Jeju episode.

However, allegations have arisen that the choreography for that “Sorry Sorry” performance may have been taken - without permission - from Monsta X.  Just recently, Wonho revealed on the group’s V-app broadcast that the DMC Festival “Sorry, Sorry” choreography was apparently taken from Monsta X without their permission. When the group asked MBC what had happened, the network allegedly told them that the choreography was cool, so it handed it off to the other groups to perform.For those who are unaware of what’s happening, back in July, Monsta X performed a cover of “Sorry, Sorry” at MBC’s Korea Music Wave event in Japan, and it included some special choreography created by the group just for the song. However, the group’s performance was cut due to “time constraints” and fancams were the only source of footage.Needless to say, Monsta X fans - and K-pop fans in general - aren’t too happy about this and have taken to social media to voice their displeasure, causing the hashtag #MONSTAXDESERVEBETTER to trend. At the time of writing, MBC have yet to respond to all these allegations. Hopefully this situation will be resolved soon.© sbs " True text
