Debbie Wasserman Schultz fired back that “it is none of anyone’s business what someone who is a member of the private sector decides to accept in terms of compensation….”  Wasserman Schultz said that Obama and Clinton, who also faced criticism for paid speeches to Wall Street, both have “pristine” public records. “They both fought back against the big banks, and their practices, and I have every confidence in the service they both provided.”  And let’s not forget that their public service is done.

He has made quite clear his plan to move the cable news network away from its bedrock liberalism….  But Lack, in seeking to make this vision a reality, has an unusual problem for a TV executive: sky-high ratings. Since the election of Trump, MSNBC’s liberal primetime programs hosted by Chris Hayes, Rachel Maddow and Lawrence O’Donnell have surged not just in ratings but in the share of the cable news audience they’re capturing. In its earnings call on Thursday, NBCUniversal specifically cited the boost in ratings to “The Rachel Maddow Show” for a spike in profits. Maddow has been the top show on cable news in the key demographic for two months running, an inconceivable achievement at MSNBC….Across the board, shows that Lack has put his stamp on and moved to the center or to the right have not performed as well as the ones he has left alone, despite MSNBC’s ability to get the media-industry press to write flattering stories about the network’s “dayside turnaround.”“Every hour that Andy has not touched are the strongest hours on the network. Everything he has touched is lower rated,” said one well-placed insider. You’d think NBCUniversal would step in and tell Lack to knock it off – if it actually minded.

In a 10-3 vote that fell essentially along party lines, the judges refused to disturb a lower court ruling that barred the administration from proceeding with a plan to deny visas to citizens of six majority-Muslim countries. A panel of another federal appeals court—the San Francisco-based 9th Circuit—is considering whether to lift an even broader order blocking the enforcement of parts of Trump’s directive. Trump issued his first executive order after it was largely halted in an earlier round of legal action. In March, he withdrew the previous foray and reissued narrowed version of the measure in March. The president billed both directives as a way to counter the threat of terrorism on U.S. soil, but critics have branded the orders as transparent attempts to carry out the “Muslim ban” Trump promised during last year’s presidential campaign.

NATO defense expenditures are not payments made by countries to the United States as a form of “protection money,” to secure a U.S. commitment to defend those that pay up. The 2 percent mark is a target for countries to spend on their own defense as part of the greater good of the alliance.As my American University colleagues Garret Martin and Balazs Martonffy have recently argued, focusing on the 2 percent target diverts attention from other capabilities that countries can bring to bear to support NATO’s many objectives. They suggest that NATO countries be graded on their contributions in each of the three areas outlined in the current Strategic Concept: collective defense, crisis management and cooperative security.NATO is not  a club.  Members don’t pay dues.     NATO is an agreement that says an attack on one NATO member is an attack on all.

In 2011 and 2012, seeking a stable source of revenue, Kushner and his partners purchased thousands of units of working-class housing in the inner-ring suburbs of cities like Baltimore and Pittsburgh. Their largest holdings are in Baltimore County, Maryland, where they control 15 complexes that house up to 20,000 people in total. And in managing these properties, reports MacGillis, Kushner is a harsh and unforgiving landlord.Kushner’s company is relentless in its pursuit of “virtually any unpaid rent or broken lease—even in the numerous cases where the facts appear to be on the tenants’ side.” Residents are slapped with thousands of dollars in fees and penalties, even if they had previously won permission to terminate a lease. All of this is compounded by poor upkeep of facilities. MacGillis describes one family that has had to deal with mold, broken appliances, and physical damage to their unit—even after paying the management company for repairs. In one complex, a resident “had a mouse infestation that was severe enough that her 12-year-old daughter recently found one in her bed.” In another, raw sewage flowed into the apartment.Jared Kushner stepped down as chief executive of Kushner Companies upon taking his position in the White House, although he retains a $600 million stake in the business, which still holds and manages these properties. “They’re nothing but slumlords,” said one tenant to MacGillis. For someone whose company all but exploits the precariousness and desperation of people who have few other choices for decent housing, it is a fair charge.What’s striking about this story of exploitation and extraction is how it’s one of many within the Trump administration."

And yet, for reasons that have yet to be explained Republican elected lawmakers in the House and Senate, not to mention elected Republicans across the nation, almost without exception still publicly support this president. By and large, were they to place country over party, there’s no question most would be rewarded at the ballot boxes.As far as the fraudulent belief they today hang their hats on, President Donald Trump’s base will not stand by him forever. The number of conservatives who support him will not stay at this level for long. “Donald Trump’s Base Is Shrinking” reports statistician Nate Silver today. “Trump’s base seems to be eroding. There’s been a considerable decline in the number of Americans who strongly approve of Trump, from a peak of around 30 percent in February to just 21 or 22 percent of the electorate now.”In other words, just one in five Americans strongly support Trump. Three months ago it was three in ten. That’s a big drop in a short period of time.“Far from having unconditional love from his base, Trump has already lost almost a third of his strong support,” Silver writes. “And voters who strongly disapprove of Trump outnumber those who strongly approve of him by about a 2-to-1 ratio, which could presage an ‘enthusiasm gap’ that works against Trump at the midterms.”On Twitter Silver calls the belief Trump’s base won’t leave him a “myth.”" True link

Beside them, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held hands with his wife, Sara…By now, it’s a foregone conclusion that Souza has been silently trolling the Trump administration using his Instagram feed, and Tuesday’s posted image of the Obamas’ closeness only fueled that theory.“Master of classy shade,” one Instagram user commented on Souza’s post.“You troll terrifically,” another wrote."

The Trump budget reflects the longstanding premise of American [regressive] economic thought: Government assistance to the poor perpetuates poverty by increasing dependence; slashing taxes increases productivity, efficiency, and economic growth; and economic growth will do far more to improve the lot of the poor than government handouts ever could.There was never much empirical support for these ideas. But when America’s top marginal rate was 70 percent and our welfare system had yet to be “reformed” — which is to say, when Ronald Reagan was elected — they had a patina of plausibility.Today, they have none.An overwhelming body of research has established that government transfers from rich to poor effectively reduce poverty, while regressive tax cuts do not reliably spur economic growth.By themselves, these findings would be damning enough to the [GOP’s] project. But new research also suggests that well-designed social-welfare programs don’t merely alleviate the deprivations of the vulnerable — they also increase productivity and entrepreneurship. Which is to say: Government handouts generate the economic benefits that conservatives attribute to regressive tax cuts.Here’s a quick review of recent findings from economic research that demonstrate the Trump budget’s intellectual bankruptcy."

Not just because he’s a former senator and vice-presidential nominee with bipartisan bona fides and loads of political baggage, but because he currently works at Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman, a New York–based law firm that regularly represents President Trump.That potential conflict was made even clearer Tuesday when it was reported that Trump has hired Marc Kasowitz, Lieberman’s boss, to serve as his private lawyer on issues related to the Russia investigation. A day later, in a rare acknowledgment that conflicts of interest actually exist, the White House has reportedly nixed Lieberman’s name from its list of potential FBI directors and is restarting its search from scratch.  It’s a search that may take longer than expected to resolve since no one appears to want the job. So far, at least a half dozen potential FBI directors have removed their names from the running.

That has changed. The Washington Post reported Friday that investigators have identified a current White House official as a person of interest in its financial probe. (The story hinted, and New York Magazine contributor Yashar Ali confirmed, that the person is Jared Kushner.)Ominously for Trump, the Post reports that the FBI is “determining whether any financial crimes were committed by people close to the president.” While Kushner’s public persona differs wildly from that of the president in the functioning of his real-estate work, he is a kind of mini Trump. Inheriting an empire from his father, he has operated in gray areas of the world economy and positioned himself to gain handsomely from Trump’s election. Kushner has met with the head of a Russian bank functionally controlled by Vladimir Putin. He appears to be eager to use his proximity to Trump to make a buck; his family business is exploiting the familial connection to sell visas in China. Trump himself has a long, nontransparent history of business dealings with organs of the Russian state. (Last week, The Wall Street Journal dug up another case.)All this implies that the probe is scrutinizing the financial aspects of Trump’s business, which is a family operation. While some Trump advisers opposed the firing of Comey, Kushner reportedly advocated for it. That fact may seem strange if one thinks of Kushner as a voice of pragmatism. But it is easier to understand if you think of him as a figure sitting near the heart of a financial scandal, who harbors a strong interest in suppressing the investigation.Another thing that has changed over the last week is the centrality of Michael Flynn, the fired national security adviser. While his tenure was extremely brief, Flynn turns out to have been both far more corrupt and far closer to Trump than previously understood." True link

To achieve that aim, terrorists need the media’s help. That applies both to the news networks, which often play the same scene on loop despite having no new information, and to social media, where people rush to express their concern and outrage. Along the way, misinformation and fear spreads like wildfire. That’s the playbook for these events now, and research suggests it gives terrorists exactly what they want.“Public mass-murder terrorism—religious-inspired to white-supremacist to school shootings—has a media strategy. Media keeps cooperating,” author and researcher Zeynep Tufekci, an expert in how information spreads online, wrote on Twitter Monday night, admonishing people to not share images of dead bodies and videos of fear over and over on a loop."
