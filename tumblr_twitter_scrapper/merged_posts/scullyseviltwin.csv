I feel awful. I feel like I’m in a lifeboat, bobbing along, completely lost at sea. When there are people around, my grief is kept at bay, it’s manageable. And then comes the quiet, when every moment I’ve shared with my mother come just barreling back at me and I have to sit with it, chew on it, digest it, file it away. I know I need to sit with it, in the quiet, and let it wash over me, because that’s the only way to really make my psyche understand that she’s gone.As I type this, they’re burning up her body; she doesn’t physically exist anymore.And still I want to be there with her, holding her hand, telling her it’s okay to be scared and it’s okay to let go, like she did for me, so many times. My mother was a constant support. She was a pragmatist, who would tell me when things would get better in time, or who would just tell me that “It’s sucks, I know, I’m sorry.” She never let me for a second think that I was unloved, taught me the difference between liking someone and loving them (and that even if you love someone deeply you might not necessarily like them all the time), taught me that it was okay to be scared, but it was very important to try. She taught me that it was okay to slow down, that sometimes you just don’t have the answers to the most difficult questions, but that’s life. There’s no guilt like this. Living fifteen minutes away from her and seeing her sporadically because you’re so mad that she let herself get so sick, so mad at yourself that you didn’t give more of yourself to help her get better, mad at your dad because he was so angry in all of the wrong ways that she was just so ill, just not wanting to deal with any of it. I hurt for my mom because she never because the woman she wanted to be. Her life took some unexpected twists and turns and dives. And she was still helping me, right up to the very last, squeezing my hand because she knew I was scared. When you have someone like that in your corner all the time, god, it’s like losing a limb having to let them go. The physical spaces she occupied will never be the same, the people she knew will have lost some of their shimmer, the mental space she takes up will be larger and more raw, and I know it will all get better with time, but I just want to stop time here, because I feel terribly guilty thinking about anything else. I want her to pet my hair again, I want her to kiss my forehead, I want to put my head in her lap and make faces when the news talks about Trump, I want her to tell me “this too shall pass.” Hell, I’d settle for curling up in the hospital bed with her like I did so many times, NCIS on mute in the background. I know she’s gone, but I really, really, very irrationally just want my mommy back." True text

But Holmes, whose birth name was Herman Mudgett, was long rumored to have applied his infamous skills of deceit to his own fate, and one legend has it that he paid off jail guards to hang a cadaver in his place so he could escape to South America.  Following a request by a descendant of Mudgett, a court in Pennsylvania has issued an order allowing the remains to be unearthed… Read more.

She’s a van driver for a production company. She works 14-hour days but says she doesn’t mind, says she keeps one eye on the road and the other on the prize — a paycheck that has to last through the dead months. We’re driving through a poor stretch of Atlanta. Dirty streets. Old houses. Plastic toys upturned in front yards, no kids though. The neighborhood is quiet. I live in L.A., land of nannies and gardeners where the hills are alive with the sound of toddlers and leaf blowers. I prefer Atlanta. You can find parking at the grocery store in the middle of the day. In L.A. it doesn’t matter what time it is, the Trader Joe’s is packed with SAHs and WAHs (stay-at-homes and work-at-homes.) We pass a decades-old Buick Skylark. I point it out. “You into cars?” Mae asks. I’m not into cars, but my dad and I once abandoned one of those Buicks on the side of a Florida highway when I was a teenager. That’s how my family did cars — we bought them on their last leg and left them where they died. I tell her how I’d come home from high school and there’d be nothing in the fridge but a bottle of red wine vinegar and a head of lettuce. On the counter, there’d be a bag of potatoes and a bottle of olive oil from the Dollar Store. That was dinner, potatoes and lettuce. “I hear you,” she says. “We had ketchup sandwiches all the time growing up. We didn’t complain. We ate them.” Mae’s voice is rich, melodic, it’s Maya Angelou meets Gladys Knight. I tell her about the time I borrowed red stirrup pants. (Remember stirrup pants from the 80s?) I borrowed them from my friend Marla. Her two older brothers drove Corvettes, one each. Marla drove a more sensible car for a 16-year-old, an Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. But it was new. And it was hers. She let me borrow the pants for a party in her neighborhood. (God knows I couldn’t go in my own shit clothes.) Long and short of it, the pants ripped in the calf. My mother wept like death had come, struggling with red thread, looking at me like I’d done the worst thing ever. Marla wanted $17 to replace them. Mae invites me to sit up front with her. The traffic to my hotel is bad, we’re in for a haul. I switch out at the next red light. “So her brothers drive corvettes?” Yup. “One each?” Yup. “Lord Almighty,” she says, “folks of privilege don’t understand how $17 can ruin you.” Mae tells me how she’d come home from school and her mother would hustle her and her sisters upstairs to pick out clothes for the next day before the utilities cut off. Too many red notices. I was poor in Florida. Mae’s from Detroit. I ask what she did to keep warm. “Poor kids just do what they gotta do. Privileged kids panic if they can’t have new this and new that, or if they can’t be on a sport team. Sports and heat, those are luxuries.” I ask if she’s heard of John Prine, the folk singer. I sing his line: It’s a half an inch of water and you think you’re gonna drown. She howls, “Rich folks standing in a puddle screaming!” I tell her about my parents shaking me awake in the middle of the night whispering, we have to go now. There’s a difference between going and getting out. What we were doing was getting out before morning, before the neighbors would see us evicted. “I hear you,” she says. “Lord Almighty, I hear you.” America loves helping the shoeless, iphoneless, voteless, bug-infested Street Jesuses. These are the lost-cause poor; all they want is your pocket change. (Bless their hearts.) But the working poor? Those who claim to not have enough money for food because they also need clothes for work, water for bathing and laundry, rent for housing, heat in the winter, money for daycare, a smartphone for their job, car insurance and gas — those are some shifty motherfuckers. If you’re on food stamps America has every right to hate you, as evidenced by this angry conservative yelling at a father and child for using food stamps. This lady proves conservatives love a good hate like they love a good steak. I assume she thinks of herself as a nice person, a good person, a church-goer. We all think everyone else is the asshole, right? There isn’t a lot of self-directed road rage out there. How often do we key our own cars? It’s always okay to hate the other guy when the hate is justified — like child predators, rapists, and food stamp users. Huddled round the Fox News campfire are those who love tall tales of poor people using tax dollars to buy drugs and alcohol and Gucci shoes. That’s not how it works. I’ve been on food stamps. The government doesn’t hand out wads of cash. When you qualify for food stamps you receive a plastic grocery card that only works for food transactions. Key word: qualify. You don’t just sign up. It’s not a tennis lesson at the club. What’s scary about the woman in the video is that she sees what’s in the dad’s cart (food for his kid) and she hates him for it. Stupid fucking poor people. If only we’d been engineer majors in college. If only we’d gone to college. If only our parents hadn’t been poor. If only they spoke English. If only we worked harder. If only we were more like conservatives who believe everything they have today is a direct result from the sweat of their own brow. When looking at a spider’s web can you point to the 8th spun web, or the 108th? There are those who claim this astounding ability — those who take full credit for crafting, spin by spin, a better life than ours, a life without aid. If you had help paying for college, if someone bought you your first car, if you had health insurance growing up, if your mom never cried over $17, you were lucky. The Hail Mary toss of birth landed you in a family that could put you on a soccer team and buy cleats as your foot grew. And someone was home to help you with your math and give you a gummy vitamin each morning. That’s called aid, by the way. And not all kids get it, but all kids should. Don’t confuse aid with charity. Charity is old coats. Donating a coat doesn’t make you a good person but I bet it makes you feel like one. You didn’t even want that coat anymore, what you wanted was the closet space. Sure, you could have sold it at a garage sale and made, like, twenty bucks. It was an expensive coat, damn it. But you, with your heart of gold, gave it away. There’s a twinkle in God’s eye just for you. What makes you a good person to others (and not just to yourself) is the same thing that makes me, or anyone who can afford the occasional $12 cocktail, a good person: Your vote. Not your coat. Vote for a Living Wage for others. Vote for health insurance for others. Don’t get in the way of food stamps for others. Understand how important $17 might be to others. That poor stretch of Atlanta is quiet because people are working and paying for day care. They’re clocking the same hours you’re clocking, but they make a shit wage.  Take a good long look at your feet. If you were born at the starting line wearing a nice pair of running shoes, that was luck. Sheer luck. The most important thing you can do now is help those who had to start the race a mile behind you, barefoot.   This fucking this. Your fucking pocket change in the hand of the guy sitting beside the coffee shop, your fucking goodwill handmedowns that you wouldn’t be caught dead in anymore, that shitty bagel you bought for that homeless guy once seven years ago, that don’t mean shit, my friend. That doesn’t help anyone. You aren’t helping a goddamned single person with these tiny petty acts of charity, so you don’t get to pat yourself on the back for it. Government support programs help people, improved mental health care helps people, a livable minimum wage helps people. ACTUALLY helps people, improves their lives every SINGLE day, not just that one time you put a $5 food hamper in the food bank donation box. If you want to actually help, you vote to support these things. You speak out about it to the people you know. That helps. That’s what you do to help. " False link

The platform, which moved its servers to Russia in December last year, updated its terms of service last week, Gizmodo reports. Under the terms, content deemed as “political solicitation,” or that “contradictory to the laws of the Russian Federation” will be banned. Russian law gives censors sweeping powers to ban political and pro-LGBTQ content under the guise of national security. But critics say the law has been used as an excuse to discriminate against the LGBTQ community.  Shit, that’s where a ton of my fic is hosted.
