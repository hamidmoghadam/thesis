The actor has joined The CW’s upcoming Archie comics adaptation in a recurring role, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.  Set in present day, Riverdale offers a subversive take on Archie (K.J. Apa), Betty (Lili Reinhart), Veronica (Camila Mendes), Jughead Jones (Cole Sprouse), Josie (Ashleigh Murray) and their friends. The midseason drama takes a closer look at the surrealism of small-town life — the darkness and weirdness bubbling beneath Riverdale’s wholesome facade. Castillo will play Oscar, a serious, successful songwriter from New York who is also a visiting professor at Carson College, located in Riverdale. Cool and exacting, Oscar agrees to audition Archie in the hopes of possibly mentoring the aspiring singer-songwriter – but does Archie have true musical chops? Castillo will make his series debut in episode five. Best known for his role as Richie on the acclaimed HBO comedy, Castillo’s other credits include Gotham, Easy and the Ricky Gervais film Special Correspondents. He is repped by CAA, TMT Entertainment Group and attorney Rick Genow. Riverdale hails from exec producers Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, Greg Berlanti, Sarah Schechter and Jon Goldwater. The series is produced by Warner Bros. Television in association with Berlanti Productions.  Riverdale is set to bow midseason on The CW." True link

And though we’ll have to stay tuned (literally) to see how the comic continues to weave in and out of the TV series, the writing staff of the show is heavily involved in making sure the comic isn’t just a simple side project.  “The chance to explore the world of Riverdale in a comic book – the form that first introduced the world to Archie, the love triangle, his hometown – was something we couldn’t pass up,” said Archie Comics Chief Creative Officer and Riverdale showrunner Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, also via statement. “Believe me, these stories matter. If you’re a fan of the show, you’ll find that the comics add another layer of conflict and drama. If you’re an Archie Comics fan, this series will serve as a great set of standalone stories in the universe of the TV series. We – myself and the show’s writers – are treating the comics with the same care and attention to detail fans will see on the screen as we weave one, large unforgettable narrative.”" True link
