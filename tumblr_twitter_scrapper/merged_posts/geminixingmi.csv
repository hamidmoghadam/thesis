Paypal: godparentproject@gmail.com   Since we’re having the hardest time reaching our goal to move the baby and her father out of the awful place they live in before they get evicted in the first place, I felt like an update would help us get even the tiniest of boosts. But, apart from that obvious problem, issues that we thought that were over are returning to haunt us.  In this post, which was the beginning of it all, I mentioned the many hardships that we had feeding, healing and comforting Chefi and Aisha after their late wife and mother passed away. Today, they’re in the same situation. This family can’t afford groceries, still getting non-perishable goods from the Red Cross and little to none fresh food. Their medicines are limited, including the baby’s extremely expensive inhalers, Chefi’s antidepressants which basically keep him alive and, last but not least… The baby’s oxygen tank.  Back in the day purchased by a generous donator, it’s already running low. And with the awfully hot temperatures and allergens in the spring air, the baby truly needs a new one to keep her acute asthma in place. The total of the tank ascends to 1275€, the same price of the first tank we obtained. The inhalers, antidepressants and such are a bit over 350€.  And as much as their safety plus physical and mental health alarm me, their nutrition, sadly, goes first. The baby’s nutrition, mostly. Her supplies are out of our league, so please feel free to check out this list of items that she desperatedly needs, including baby formula, regular baby food and, sadly, diapers too. She’s just 5 months old so the items she needs remain the same.  TLDR; although moving this family out of their dangerous home is our main goal, the baby needs a new oxygen tank, new inhalers, regular supplies such as diapers and food and, if possible, some clothes for this summer since she owns absolutely none.  Donate here or via godparentproject@gmail.com. Please remember to donate to us as friends or relatives so PayPal doesn’t take part of your generous donations away from us! Sharing on Twitter and Facebook got us most of our donations in the past, so please feel free to do so. Thank you.  " False link
