Okay so Sandler movies get lots of viewers (for some reason) right so he can go to a big fucking studio like Sony Pictures (Pixels) and say “yo gimme $88 million dollars to make a movie” and since thats always worked before and his films have always made a return no matter how fucking awful they are (Mall Cop 2 made over 3x budget, Zohan made over 2x, Jack & Jill just barely missed out on 2x budget) they say “yeah go on then” So now Sandler has $80 million to make a film with, and a bunch of friends who need paychecks to live on, right? So he just pays them for whatever half-assed performance they give (Kevin James, David Spade, Rob Schneider, etc) and they make a fucking movie. and its awful, but get this right Product placement. In Gilmore, Happy gets sponsored by Subway to play golf, and in Jack & Jill, the plot of the movie basically revolves around advertising, specifically for Dunkin Donuts. You’ve got Gatorade in Waterboy, McDonalds and Hooters in Big Daddy, Popeyes Chicken in Little Nicky, Wendys in Mr Deeds, Bed Bath & Beyond in Click, MySpace in Funny People, KFC in Grown Ups (Kevin James is a fat man), and a bottle or can of Budweiser is in nearly every scene of That’s My Boy, So basically, Sandler gets paid ridiculous amounts of money to make a film, gets paid even more money for product placement, then just pays his friends, and throws together an absolutely god awful film. And apparently because “Happy Gilmore/Billy Madison was funny!” (hint: they weren’t), people still go see his films twenty years later. And since he’s part producer on some of these films, he makes even more when stupid people go to see his films!  You know, it’s absolutely amazing. Under the right circumstances, a filmmaker could make more money with a flop then he could with a hit! " False text

Soooo, I decided to give y'all some ways to spice up your water to make sure you get at least 64 oz. a day.  Some can add benefits to your water and some are just for taste and some for both. 👌🏾 1. Fruit Infused 🍉🍒🍋    fruit infused water can have a lot of benefits depending on what fruit you use but usually my main reason to drink fruit water is because of taste. A few fruits I like are: - lemon - watermelon - raspberry - cucumber - coconut 2. Stay Fresh 🌿🍃    add fresh herbs: - basil - lavender  - mint  - rosemary 3. Make Tea 🍵☕️    making tea is my favorite way to jazz up my water. try to stay away from teas with a lot of caffeine like black or oolong. instead go for green, white, or herbal teas. also try to keep it unsweetened but if that’s not possible use a natural sweetener like honey, stevia, or agave nectar (I suggest honey). A few teas I like are: - Rituals Orange Jasmine Green Tea - Bigelow Green Tea - Celestial Sleepytime Vanilla Herbal Tea - almost any herbal tea  4. Make it HOT! 🔥🌶    try adding a spice to you water. I like cinnamon water or cinnamon tea. Some benefits you receive from it are reducing your waste line and reducing cravings. other spices you could probably use are: - ginger - turmeric - cayenne 5. Get Juicy 💦😏   (I really wanted to write that 😂) try adding some type of juice likeee: - lemon juice - cranberry juice - apple cider vinegar 6. Honey Water 🍯🐝    okay so this is best just with warm water in the morning but personally I’ve had it just like throughout the day but I don’t know if that hurts anything. It’s great for a sore throat!  7. Rose Water 🌹❣    so this one is basically just if you’re feeling fancy. I actually haven’t tried this before but I’m sure it’s great! " False text
