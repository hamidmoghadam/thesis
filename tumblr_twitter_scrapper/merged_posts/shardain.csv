It actually means nothing of any significance at best and is sometimes even the more wasteful, more hazardous option. A shitload of “natural” food including a lot of imported produce is grown and harvested through slave labor in inhumane conditions. Pizza, fried chicken, french fries, fast food, candy bars and chips ARE nutritious. They are loaded with good things. Just because they have an abundance of excess fats and might not be healthy as a staple doesn’t mean they are “nutritionless” or that their calories are “empty.” Those are hokey buzzwords pushed by the people in charge of how much you pay for the alternatives. Eating healthier costs more. Much more. Looking down on people for their reliance on cheaper food is extremely classist and expecting everyone to be able to live off fresh veggies and cage-free meats is insultingly unrealistic in the modern world. “Processed” literally only means the food went through some kind of automated process. This can be literally the exact same thing a human being would have done to the food for it to be labeled “unprocessed.” Being processed does not make something less healthy.  Chemicals with long, scary names are part of nature. An apple is full of compounds you probably can’t pronounce. A shorter ingredients label only means they didn’t bother listing all 300 things the product is actually made of and HAS to be made of. Preservatives, artificial flavors and other additives are not the devil. Most are harmless and in general they are part of the reason you haven’t already starved to death or died of a food borne illness. MSG is not bad for you at all. The fact that something might be made of “scrap” meats like pig snouts or chicken necks only means one thing: that we didn’t waste perfectly normal, edible meat.

Good - i could actually pay attention to shit in class - where can i buy this??? - wait there’s More stuff like this - i love you. (not related to the toy per say but that felt nice)  This right here is an important post  As a teacher, the whole “fidget spinners being marketed as toys” is the most terrifying trend my students have introduced me to. I gave a fidget cube to one of my 6th grade students who’s been struggling all year with his adhd, who is so smart but is failing math because he can’t focus in it. He was hesitant at first, about a teacher giving him something “to help” rather than punishing him, but agreed with me that it couldn’t hurt to try.  He hasn’t put it down.  Everyday since he got it, I’ve seen him with it. He holds it in his pocket, and hasn’t climbed on a table or cussed at a teacher since.  BUT There are at least 20 other kids in our school who bring fidget spinners and play with them out on the table during lessons. They don’t pay attention in class, and they disrupt other students’ learning. These are not students with adhd or anxiety, these are students who are just playing because they’re kids and that’s what kids do.  What scares me is I know other teachers have been confiscating them. They’re going to be banned, if it continues to be a problem. And my 6th grader, who’s had noticeable improvements since he started playing with his cube, is going to get in trouble for using something that helps him learn.   ReblogReblogReblog " False text

During a speech to Muslims in Saudi Arabia, Trump referred to “Islamic extremism” instead of “Islamist extremism,” as had been written. While that may sound like a distinction without a difference, Reuters explains: The term “Islamist extremism” refers to Islamism as a political movement rather than Islam as a religion, a distinction that the Republican president had frequently criticized the administration of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, for making. Trump often referred to “Islamic extremism” and criticized President Obama for using the term “Islamist extremism.” But, because he is playing nicey-nicey with the Saudis, he tried to modulate his rhetoric, but he failed. His apparent exhaustion put him right back into campaign mode. That wasn’t the only symptom of his exhaustion. Following the speech, Trump was supposed to appear at the Tweeps Forum. Instead, he sent his daughter Ivanka. Trump is 70-years-old. His diet consists of chocolate cake, double scoops of ice cream on top of a cream pie, Kentucky Fried Chicken (and other fast food) and well-done steak with ketchup. As for exercise, well, he doesn’t. He thinks exercise kills people. You’d think he would be able to handle his nine-day trip. He claims he only needs three to four hours sleep a night.  It’s understandable that a man of his age and his fitness level would have trouble keeping up with the rigors of such an ambitious trip, but one can’t help but note the hypocrisy, especially after saying this about Hillary Clinton:“To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina,” Trump said in the first presidential debate. “You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals … with Japan, with Saudi Arabia.”  Source: Washington Examiner Trump is just one country in and he’s exhausted.  Three days into the trip.  Also  is daughter should never be filling in. When a president is sick they don’t have their children do their job they have people whose job it is to step in do it. So ignoring for the moment that he shouldn’t even be exhausted and if he really is too fucking bad, his kid shouldn’t be doing the job of the president. " False link

Traci Kato-Kiriyama: It was stunning visually, but emotionally it didn’t draw me in. Keiko Agena: It was harder to watch than I thought  it was gonna be. To get emotionally invested, you have to really care  that she needs to find out who she is. But when she finally meets her  mom, my gut felt so weird in that moment. Kato-Kiriyama: That scene was devastating on all  levels. It got me because of the emotion of the mother [veteran Japanese  actress Kaori Momoi]. She’s really wonderful. That scene should have  been beautiful, but Major had nothing in her eyes. Acting-wise, what a  missed moment. Atsuko Okatsuka: I wasn’t aware they were gonna  explain the whitewashing. I thought it was just going to be an action  film, no explanation, just go with the fact that it’s a future Japan  with this robot cop. And then to be like, “Oh shit, I used to be a  Japanese woman!” (Laughter) That was against my expectations. How did you feel when that twist was revealed? Agena: That was hard, y’all. Hard and awkward. Ai Yoshihara: Major’s backstory is white people trying to justify the casting. Okatsuka: And they f—ed up in the process because  now it looks even worse. The text at the beginning of the movie  explained that Hanka Robotics is making a being that’s the best of human  and the best of robotics. For some reason, the best stuff they make  happens to be white. Michael Pitt used to be Hideo. Agena: That was the other cringe-worthy moment, when  they called each other by their Japanese names. We’re looking at these  beautiful white bodies saying these Japanese names, and it hurt my heart  a little bit. Kato-Kiriyama: It was supposed to be so touching and intimate, and it felt gross. And kind of laugh-worthy at the same time. Okatsuka: I would have preferred them just using American names. “You used to be Bob.”   When THR interviewed Japanese fans about the whitewashing claims, they weren’t bothered by it, and neither was Mamoru Oshii, who directed the 1995 anime version. How do you feel about their response? Yoshihara: People in Japan worship white people. Kato-Kiriyama: Even in the story, there are Japanese people involved in creating these beings and they also may very well see the ideal human being as a white woman. So you’re sort of messed up all the way around. Agena: Yes! I felt more messed up watching this movie. It reinforced my own personal messed-up standards of physical beauty.  SAY IT AGAIN FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK. SAY IT A-FUCKING-GAIN.  Johansson has noted that Ghost in the Shell represented a rare opportunity for a woman to star in a studio-backed action film. Tilda Swinton and her Doctor Strange filmmakers also have noted that gender-bending The Ancient One was a positive step for female representation. What do you make of their points? Kato-Kiriyama: It’s trying to get the conversation away from race yet again. Sure, it’s a great role for women. I don’t know if kick-ass white woman action stars is such a void, but even that aside, it’s trying to step over the dead body. That’s fine when there are empowered characters who are women, but that’s not what we’re talking about. We’re actually talking about race. Can we just stay here for a little bit? Okatsuka: When white feminists don’t know what to say about race, they go for the feminist thing. That’s what happened with the Women’s March. When women of color were like, “Will you be there, though, for the next march, when the next black kid gets shot? Will you be there when women of color need you?” they were like, “Wasn’t it great for women all around?” Kato-Kiriyama: To the argument they were making through Doctor Strange about not wanting to create the Fu Manchu character, it’s like, well, then don’t. Okatsuka: Give them words to speak that aren’t stereotypical.  ^^^^This is why white women shouldn’t be included in diversity discussions.  They already get their representation and then some.  There’s no deficit for them, and there never has been a deficit for them (just look at Hollywood from its early beginnings in silent film to today).  That’s the nature of a white supremacist society.  Even the art is overpopulated with whiteness (books, films, TV shows, movies, art, music).

Our applicants collectively were more motivated, mature, disciplined and consistent in their high school years than past applicants. • Class diversity increased to 31% students of color, the most diverse in our history, up from 21% two years ago. • The percentage of students who are the first-generation from their family to attend college rose from 10% to 18% in this year’s class. Our “No SAT/ACT policy” has also changed us in ways deeper than data and demographics: Not once did we sit in an Admissions committee meeting and “wish we had a test score.” Without the scores, every other detail of the student’s application became more vivid. Their academic record over four years, letters of recommendation, essays, in-person interviews, and the optional creative supplements gave us a more complete portrait than we had seen before. Applicants gave more attention to their applications, including the optional components, putting us in a much better position to predict their likelihood of success here.    I’ve literally never seen any proof that standardized testing is useful for assessing students or for institutions finding quality candidates.   Personally, I just think they exist because the industry is worth billions of dollars. Not to mention how much the test prep industry is worth.    AND these tests maintain classism and racism (which was actually their original purpose–to make sure Jewish kids couldn’t get into colleges).    Now these tests severely marginalize low income 1st gen students and Black Americans and Latinos.  " False link

It’s a tower that scrubs the pollution from more than 30,000 cubic meters of air per hour—and then condenses those fine particles of smog into tiny “gem stones” that can be embedded in rings, cufflinks, and more.   Each stone is roughly equivalent to cleaning 1,000 cubic meters of air—so you’re literally wearing the pollution that once hung in the air around Roosegaarde’s so-called Smog Free Tower. In the designer’s words, buying a ring means “you donate a thousand cubic meters of clean air to the city where the Smog Free Tower is.” The project has been in the offing for a long time. We wrote about the idea more than two years ago when the Dutch designer first publicly announced the project, which was originally planned for Beijing after the city’s mayor endorsed the idea. Roosegaarde and his team have spent the past few years developing the first prototype in Rotterdam, where it was unveiled this month. “It’s really weird that we accept [pollution] as something normal, and take it for granted,” Roosegaarde explains. To fund the travel, the studio launched a Kickstarter campaign where you can buy jewelry and cufflinks made with its tiny smog gems—which, theoretically, would eventually become diamonds if they were compressed with much more extreme pressure. But for now, the tower sits on a patch of grass next to Roosegaarde’s studio in Rotterdam, whose mayor and local government supported the project with grant money. The process taking place inside its walls is powered by 1,400 watts of sustainable energy, which is comparable to a water boiler, and the studio says it hopes to one day integrate solar PVs into the design to power the process—which works not so differently than some ionic air purifiers. Roosegaarde explains: By charging the Smog Free Tower with a small positive current, an electrode will send positive ions into the air. These ions will attach themselves to fine dust particles. A negatively charged surface -the counter electrode- will then draw the positive ions in, together with the fine dust particles. The fine dust that would normally harm us, is collected together with the ions and stored inside of the tower. This technology manages to capture ultra-fine smog particles which regular filter systems fail to do.   The team’s Kickstarter, where the studio is raising funds for another eight days, is closing in on doubling its goal—you can get your own smog gems by donating here.

According to CNN, the Rapid Response Team network could shelter hundreds and potentially thousands of undocumented immigrants across Southern California. “That’s what we need to do as a community to keep families together,” said Pastor Ada Valiente, after showing CNN a house that is ready to host three families.   Similar services for immigrant families are already being provided by numerous churches and religious buildings in the area. According to CNN, this Rapid Response Team seeks to go beyond the existing measures. Another participant who did not want to be identified told CNN he will do everything in his power to protect his guests if immigration authorities come knocking on his door.
