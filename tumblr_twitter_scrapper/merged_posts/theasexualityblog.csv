I can nearly guarantee you that most of the REGs who are doing this – who are making these bullshit callouts, who are building these huge smear campaigns – don’t actually believe that there is a “network of advocates for pedophiles” among the inclusionists. But we started no-platforming them. We started ignoring them. For many of us inclusionists, the discourse had died down because we had stopped engaging with exclusionist’s toxic bullshit.  What better way to make noise than to use an accusation that would get people, even people uninvolved with discourse, to spread these massive callouts with misinterpreted receipts? To mass block and harass people? What better way to paint aspecs and inclusionists as abusers than to use a word that makes everyone’s knee-jerk disgust reaction fire? What better way to make themselves relevant again than to make themselves out to be the protectors of children and csa survivors? What better way to force inclusionists to pay attention to them again, than to accuse them of being something they can’t possibly ignore? That they have to combat, or they’ll be painted as Guilty by Silence?  The whole thing falls apart quickly, of course, if you actually read the receipts…but many people won’t do that. And they know that. They know that people won’t want to dive through dozens of posts to see if any of them are true, but that they’ll feel guilty if they don’t reblog it just in case there’s dangerous people up there. But when you look at the discourse. When you look at how REGs have harassed, misgendered, misinterpreted, lied, sent fake screenshots, doctored screenshots, mocked people for their disabilities, mocked people for their triggers, mocked people for the words they’ve chosen to ID with, told people that their abuse didn’t happen the way they remember, told people that their abuse outright didn’t happen, posted porn and suicide baiting in the ace positivity tags, actively tried to erase history to make themselves seem correct, exposed themselves to be biphobes, transphobes, TERFs, and TRUSCUM, harassed people (even minors!) to the point of mental breakdown and even suicide attempts, erased Aspecs of Color, used Autistics as pawns, implied that all inclusionists are “cishet” even though a ton of us are neither cis nor het, implied that aspecs are inherently homophobic for just existing, implied that we’re the reason for other tags being wiped, actively wished violence against us, made us out to be an oppressor class so that we’re “easy” to bully…. The list goes on. But when you see this list, this minuscule example of just what I’ve seen and what I can remember….Those of you who are still uninvolved, I really need you to think. Even if you don’t think aspecs are LGBT+. Even if you don’t think aspecs are marginalized. Even if you actively hate me, or anyone who is currently being smeared. Are these really the kind of people you want to support? Are these the kind of people you want to trust? Can we really look at what they’ve done and think this is no more than just an internet debate?  This isn’t just petty discourse. These accusations could ruin lives. These accusations, these false accusations against many people who have victimized by pedophilia, are not a little joke. This is hurting real people. People who have already been hurt by the very abuse that REGs are claiming they are sympathetic to.  And I know this whole post reads vaguely like propaganda, I know it may seem like I’m making a lot of leaps in judgement by saying that REGs are making these false callouts with the express purpose of slandering inclusionists instead of alerting people to real, dangerous individuals. But I don’t think it’s that much a leap, mostly because of a one fact: A few people, otherwise not involved, have come forward to ask that people not group csa survivors and pedophile apologists…only to find themselves added to the list as a “pedophile apologist”. The very request that people not group victims of pedophilia in with pedophiles is enough to warrant someone being a pedophile apologist. That fact proves that it’s about slander, not safety.  And it’s because of this that I have this request: Please, for the love of god, read the receipts – all of them – on callouts you see. If you have questions, message the people. Ask them for clarification especially if you can search their blog and find that they are queer, trans, or a csa survivor.  There are real pedophiles on this site, but these lists are making it ten times harder to know when accusations are legitimate. My inbox is open, though not to anons. Not about this. I will personally clarify anything having to do with these “receipts” against me, and I’m sure most people on the list would do the same.  …this got really long, so I’m sorry. I’m having a lot of thoughts about this situation. About how in order to defend myself as an aspec, I have to deal with people abusing me this way. About how I want to stop dealing with this but can’t. About what to do. Don’t worry, followers, I have no intention of deleting or anything like that. I just…have to think about how to deal with this in an appropriate and healthy way. Because just making posts and hoping that people will read them and understand, hoping that enough people will call out these REGs making these lists, isn’t working. I’m just a small blogger, and that one list has about 400 notes now – 400 people who probably haven’t read the receipts and are just spreading these lies. It hurts me, personally, but it hurts me for the CSA survivors on the list more. I can’t imagine what it’s like for people who have been abused in such a way to see people claiming they sympathize and even advocate for the people who abused them. And for other people to believe them and spread that lie without even checking their blog. I can’t imagine how that must feel.  And I’m just sorry. I’m so sorry that this is happening. That the same people keep getting abused over and over again because they happened to be vocal about Ace Discourse™.  And I’m tired. I honestly can’t believe that there are people out there who would stoop so low as to paint abuse victims as the abusers, to lie and smear and slander…and pretend like they’re in the right.  End point: Please read the receipts of callouts before you reblog them. Please ask people for clarification if you feel comfortable and safe in doing so. Think critically about who’s posting these lists, who’s on them, and what benefit such accusations may have. Because REGs are using ignorance to actively abuse vulnerable people…so we have to be more vigilant.   I know this is a long post, folks, but please do read the whole thing. It’s important.  Exclusionists/REGs are  abusers in the truest sense.And before one of them cries out “But I would never do that I just don’t want X in my community”If you don’t call them out, work against those who do, and distance yourself from those, you are one of ‘those’.

We even have that for ace characters and it’s super great.  We don’t have a lot of books about actually BEING ace though.  About the effects of coming out, about navigating relationships as ace, about discovering the identity within yourself, about dealing with the shitty things people say.   And I really want to read those stories.  I know they say when you want to read something you have to write it yourself, but I don’t have these skills so I’m just going to write about how I feel instead and hope.I have been recommended a few books to check out, which I’ll review in the coming weeks, but please feel free to make suggestions to me if you have them.  " False text

BackgroundIndividuals belonging to sexual minority groups face many barriers in accessing appropriate health care. The term ‘sexual minority group’ is usually used to refer to Lesbian Gay Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) individuals. Anecdotal and research evidence suggests that those who identify as asexual have similar poor experiences. MethodsThis work uses a systematic review and qualitative analysis of the existing interview data from self-identified asexuals, to construct features of the asexual identity. The findings will help practitioners and health professionals develop an understanding of this poorly understood construct. Ultimately this work is aimed at facilitating culturally competent care in the context of asexuality. ResultsQualitative analysis produced 3 themes, which can be used, not only to frame asexuality in a positive and normalising way, but also to provide greater understanding of asexuality, ‘romantic differences coupled with sexual indifference’, ‘validation through engagement with asexual communities’ and ‘a diversity of sub-asexual identities’. ConclusionsHaving some understanding of what it means to identify as asexual, respecting the choices made by asexuals and can markedly improve the experiences of those who embrace an asexual identity when engaging with healthcare. Relevance to clinical practiceAnecdotal evidence, taken from one of the largest asexual online forums, suggests that a number of self-identified asexuals choose not to disclose their identity to health care professionals through fear of their asexual status being pathologised, problematised, or judged. Given that asexuality is a poorly understood concept, this may be due to lack of understanding on behalf of healthcare providers. The review provides health professionals and practitioners working in clinical settings with some insights of the features of an asexual identity to facilitate culturally competent care.This article is protected by copyright.
