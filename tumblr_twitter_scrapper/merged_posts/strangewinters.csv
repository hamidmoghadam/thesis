Eve and Jenkins keep each other up to date on codes, Morse code signals, everything like that and also start doing yoga together after he falls to save her that one time. Ezekiel and Jenkins bond over Nessie, and stumpy’s small grave marker Jenkins made for the young man in the Libraries cemetery ( Yes we have one of those rooms to Mr. Jones.) They have the longest heart to hearts really on days when Ezekiel feels his worst Jenkins and Stone go ‘drinking’ together. He accepts Jacob’s bravado and near but hits because he knows it’s default for Jacob. They sit and drink and talk about architecture they like. Jenkins smirks as the young man gets overly excited about minute details. Jenkins and Cassie Bake. Cookies. Cakes. Anything he can find really. This young woman missed out on so much and he’s determined to show her he cares even if he can’t show it well. He lets her come into his lab and help with experiments after a while. Soon her presence becomes common place in his lab. He even eventually clears a spot and a work bench for her to have her own tools and such. Sometimes he finds her asleep there and carefully moves her to a more comfortable place. Jenkins sitting at the mirror in a staring contest with Judson. Angry but also loyal to this man. Only softening when Charlene appears and soothes him just a touch. Tears in his eyes as she says she’s been watching him and his so proud of him. The shock when she asks him to try to move on. That it’s a new time now. That he is still a knight but even he can learn to love others. She implores him because she does care. She just can’t care that much. Jenkins taking her advice and becoming more open with the whole group. Still sarcastic and Jenkins but now Galahad leaks through more. He laughs with the boys more. He fights with them strongly. He is more knightly. He tells Eve he trusts her and that he’d help her even if she told him not too. He tells Cassie he loves her very much. He starts leaving flowers for her and is gentle with her, even more than before. But he also becomes more passionate in talking with her about their shared and varied interests. Just Jenkins evolving from this stoic leave me alone you awful humans to so much more. To a father, a brother, a friend, a possible partner to this wonderful frustrating group of humans that have taken residence in his annex. " False text

He was an internationally famous Quidditch player but was still in school, showing he probably still valued his education, plus he was a good enough wizard to be chosen as the Durmstrang champion by the goblet of fire. He was an internationally famous Quidditch player with lots of fangirls, but hung around the library for ages trying to work up the courage to ask Hermione Granger to the Yule Ball, and I think that’s adorable. He didn’t behave like an asshole dudebro when Hermione wasn’t interested in dating him. Hermione was also used as the person he would miss the most in the second task, and I think that says less about Hermione than the people around Viktor Krum.  We know he had parents.  We know he had teammates.  But none of those relationships were apparently more healthy or comforting than this nice girl he had just met at Hogwarts, and that makes me sad. He had zero patience for Dark Arts and Dark wizards, even though he went to a school that emphasized both of those things. He stayed on good enough terms with Fleur that he was invited to her wedding. His problem solving method once included partially turning himself into a shark.  A shark. " False text
