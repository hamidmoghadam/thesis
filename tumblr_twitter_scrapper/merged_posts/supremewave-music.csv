You can check out the song and watch the video at alltimelow.com . Our good friend Pat Tracy, who directed the ‚ÄòMissing You‚Äô video helped us bring it to life, and we couldn‚Äôt be happier about where the story will go from here. Pay close attention. ¬†:)‚Äù‚ÄúI hope you all love the song as much as I do. We‚Äôre ecstatic about everything we have lined up this year, and can‚Äôt wait to add this one to the set list as we get back out on the road. See you soon!‚ÄùAlex goes on to speak about signing to Fueled By Ramen.‚ÄúHere we are. Ten years since our first official full-length debut, (nearly 14 years since we formed this band,) and we‚Äôre lucky enough to be sharing another chapter in the tale of All Time Low with the world. We couldn‚Äôt be more grateful than we are right now.‚Äù‚ÄúI hope you can forgive us, because we‚Äôve been keeping secrets.‚Äù‚ÄúSince the beginning of last year, we have officially been signed to Fueled By Ramen records, the very first label we ever showcased for during our senior year of high school. It didn‚Äôt work out back then, and that‚Äôs ok (we probably blew it), but FBR has always felt like a second musical family to us through everything.‚Äú ""From Hopeless Records, to Interscope, and back to Hopeless, we‚Äôve come up listening to the bands on the FBR roster, working together on outside projects, watching with pride and admiration, looking forward to the moment when timing and purpose would align, affording us the chance to come in under their wing. So, here we are; a year spent in secret on a new label, writing songs and brainstorming for what comes next. I‚Äôm happy to say that we can finally deliver.‚Äù‚ÄúPs. sending all our love and gratitude to the Hopeless Records family, without whom we wouldn‚Äôt be in this position now. Thank you for supporting us and breaking down wall after wall with us as we navigated this wild ride together. You guys have been incredible to work with over the years. Good people go far, which is why you all continue to crush it day in and day out. Thank you.‚ÄùHere at SupremeWave, we were not too sure what to think when we first heard Dirty Laundry on Radio One. Lyrically, this certainly sounds like an All Time Low song, with classic Gaskarth lyrics throughout the song. The sound and feel for the song, however, is certainly different to All Time Low‚Äôs usual sound, at times almost unrecognisable, with vocal sound effects added to the chorus. But the song certainly becomes more familiar sounding at around 02:15 when the songs suddenly picks up tempo and has a more rock-y feel to it. Some fans may feel a little concerned with the change of sound and new record label, pointing to 2011‚Äôs Dirty Work, the bands forth studio album, released under a new record label, Interscope. This did not really end that well for All Time Low, with the band leaving after just one album, stating that creative differences was the main reason behind the departure. We think fans shouldn‚Äôt feel worried about changing labels as they join a host of fantastic bands already signed to Fueled By Ramen, such as Paramore, Panic! at the Disco and Twenty One Pilots. We feel with the band now being in their late 20s, a change in sound was always on the cards and the band has certainly been experimenting here and there with their sound on a few tracks on the previous couple of albums. We are excited for the future of All Time Low, we think you should be as well!" True text

Adele, who was already having an emotional night, was overwhelmed and unaccepting of the decision.‚ÄúI can‚Äôt possibly accept this award,‚Äù Adele said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very humbled and very grateful and gracious, but my artist of my life is Beyonc√©.‚ÄùAdele also spoke about the huge cultural impact the Lemonade album has had, and also the cultural impact it has had on her personally, saying ‚ÄúThe way you make my black friends feel is empowering, and you make them stand up for themselves,‚Äù.Many people believe there is a race problem among Grammy voters; a black artist hasn‚Äôt won Album of the Year since 2008 when Herbie Hancock won with River: The Joni Letters.Speaking to Pitchfork, the president of the Recording Academy, Neil Portnow, said he doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúthink there‚Äôs a race problem at all‚Äù.‚ÄúRemember, this is a peer-voted award,‚Äù he told the publication. ‚ÄúSo when we say the Grammys, it‚Äôs not a corporate entity - it‚Äôs the 14,000 members of the Academy.‚ÄùHe then continues after stating that the outcome of the award is due to the thousands of people who vote, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt, as musicians, in my humble opinion, listen to music based on gender or race or ethnicity. When you go to vote on a piece of music - at least the way that I approach it - is you almost put a blindfold on and you listen.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a matter of what you react to and what in your mind as a professional really rises to the highest level of excellence in any given year. And that is going to be very subjective. That‚Äôs what we ask our members to do, even in the ballots.‚ÄúNow here‚Äôs the other interesting part of the process, and we stand 100 percent behind the process: It‚Äôs a democratic vote by majority. So somebody could either receive or not receive a Grammy based on one vote. It could be that tight.‚ÄùStormzy, a British Grime artist, has previously spoken his thoughts on the lack of diversity at the Brit Awards, suggesting this may be an industry wide issue. He said this to BBC Radio One‚ÄúIt was such a great year for grime and underground music. I thought maybe this year it might get celebrated. You know when you‚Äôve got that little bit of hope and that little bit of faith, and then they didn‚Äôt. I thought it was such a shame. It‚Äôs just a matter of breaking the doors down and carrying on.‚ÄúGoing back to this year‚Äôs Grammys, Solange Knowles has joined the debate, which is being discussed by both black and white artists, calling on those angered by the result to: ‚ÄúCreate your own committees, build your own institutions, give your friends awards, award yourself, and be the gold you wanna hold, my Gs.‚Äù Solange, who is Beyonc√©‚Äôs sister, won the best R&B performance award at the Grammys for Cranes in the Sky. We believe Solange Knowles has a strong point and feel it would be fitting to end this article with the following quote: ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ‚ÄúBe the change you want to see in the world.‚Äù Do you think the Grammy has an issue with diversity? We would love to hear your thoughts!SupremeWave¬†" True text
