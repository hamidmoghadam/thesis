There’s an unbearable weight to suffering: as you watch your loved one suffer, the pain becomes your own - even science says so -the suffering becomes a part of you, a part of your truth. There’s an unbearable weight to helplessness:for who are we if we can’t be someone’s hero?To watch the beloved suffer whilst standing witness -transfixed - all efforts showing futile, the ball and chain have you rooted, unable to effect change, you’ve been muted. There’s an unbearable weight to rigor mortis:as you lift the body, finding it refusing to comply, a ‘dead weight’ they say, but one you loved dearly nonetheless. There’s an unbearable weight to the grave:a hole meant to confine, a few feet of earth meant to weigh down the corpse, to keep it from surfacing, to keep the pain from surfacing, to let the beloved rest eternally.  There’s an unbearable weight to love:oh, this wretched feeling that leaves you unarmed and defenseless, vulnerable to emotional assault, this emotion that ties two fates irrevocably, even if to a fault. There’s an unbearable weight to responsibility:to consider whether fit to care for another beloved, whether there is space remaining in the heart to love again.But what choice have we?For just as the lungs cannot deprive themselves of air, the soul cannot be without showing love and care.  -SH " False text
