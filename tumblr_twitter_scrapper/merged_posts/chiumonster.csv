Seriously, how many people use Photoshop out there?! I mean, of course I’m upset, but I’m equally baffled by this number - I didn’t realize that many people had an interest in making digital art. It’s nuts. Artists stealing from artists. I can’t understand it. And I am always afraid to raise my already insultingly low prices BECAUSE I am afraid of more piracy. So, what am I supposed to do here?  The sad truth is that I either DO need to raise prices to make up for the gross number of thefts and keep my income stream from diminishing (which would, of course, make them less affordable for students and young pros), or I need to completely change the business model somehow to somehow fight piracy. I don’t know how to change it, exactly, but since piracy of my products has been steadily increasing every year since I started, I need to figure something out. Final thought: If just 5% of those people had bought legally, I’d have made $750 today. Okay, okay - that thought will definitely not improve my mood. If you are a victim of piracy of your creative products, and you have some thoughts on this topic, I welcome them in comment form. Also, if you agree that this behavior is disgusting, and that we artists should be supporting one another, rather than acting like cannibals, then PLEASE REBLOG. Perhaps, if we make a little noise, it will at least make people reconsider using torrent sites when they realize that working artists are behind all of the creative products they love: music, art, film - all of it. Thanks for reading.- Kyle  Guys, seriously. I use these brushes and pay the ridiculously low price for them.  Whether it’s an torrent of a movie or one of my Darkwing comics or these brushes. Taking these for free is stealing. You all follow the wisdom of Ian Malcom, right? I think he said it best (paraphrasing)… “You were so preoccupied with if you could do something, you didn’t stop to think if you SHOULD”  Sorry for the re-blog but this sort of thing really really pisses me off. I use @kyletwebster brushes on literally a daily basis, and I have more top quality brushes than I know what to do with. All at a stupidly low price. On top of that, Kyle updates his mega brush pack for free on a regular basis, and my brush collection has gotten to the point where I don’t actually have enough time to use each and every brush made available for free to me after I actually bought the brush pack. I can’t think of a single situation in any of my paintings where I would need a brush that Kyle hasn’t already made for me and that works better than any brush I could make. Even for non-pro or student artists, seriously, $15 for an ever growing brush   set   (and that’s assuming you go for the most expensive pack) of studio grade tools is ridiculously cheap. It wouldn’t even cover most peoples weekly spend at Starbucks. Just buy the bloody brush packs. If you’re in the market for one, you’ll not find anything better at any price, and picking Kyle’s pocket to save a few bills is such a dick move. /rant off -Alex  I don’t usually reblog stuff to here but as I do heavily use Kyle’s brushes I feel it’s only right. He provides a fantastic service for a very cheap price, please support him by paying for his brushes.  Seriously!! They’re the best brushes, they’ll last you a lifetime, probably, and the price is ridiculously low for such a gigantic, and free-updating set. " False text

I’m glad you found my tag helpful! :) Ok…so, you’re right! Gesture drawing is key! But the more important thing is that when you do gesture drawing or observation drawing, you use a big fat marker. Crayola markers work fine for this, tbh, or a sharpie is great too; what matters is that you’re forcing yourself to work with a smaller margin of error so that you focus on the larger strokes, AKA where the line of action is. There’s no secret to this; keep practicing drawing figures! A few tips though: Angles are more natural, and you push poses by pushing your line of action (the arrows I marked in red)! For reference, if I can’t go to a life drawing session I use Pixelovely, Scott Eaton’s Bodies in Motion Gallery, and I freeze-frame youtube videos of punks running around. Or I pause anime and draw those crazy poses there! In terms of sketching and getting ideas down: andIf it’s just about the ideas, who cares how pretty it is! The focus is what you’re thinking of and such. Just write and scribble down whatever comes to mind, and don’t worry about how nice it looks. And then, secondly, looking at real stuff is important. Maybe you get inspired by the way the lights in your hometown twinkle at night, or the way that small girl thought a skeleton dog was the cutest thing; the real world is a fun place! I think a lot of the work that I do seems pretty fictional, but most of it is inspired by some element I interacted with in real life! Hope that helps!" True text

I want to be an artist too but im in my second year as a science major so I’m conflicted about chasing my dreams or staying safe u know??” — (name withheld for privacy purposes) WELL. Funny story, in the thrill of a very dramatic (but in actuality, very undramatic and full of meme gold) 2012 presidential election, I was inspired to enter government policy and effect social change from there. I kept up with the news, kept a “thoughts on politics” journal, and other youthful passionate endeavors. But at the end of the day:I…just wouldn’t have been very good in that field. And also miserable, to be honest, because after my fifth polisci class I was 1000% done. Figuring out a suitable career is like a test of endurance, I think, and I just couldn’t picture myself working in policy for a career–which is what, 20-30 years of your life at the least? THATS A LONG TIME. As for storyboarding, my tendency has always been to sketch and doodle a lot of drawings, vs to make a few refined drawings! My professor also amusedly told me, “I don’t think making finished drawings comes naturally to you,” and he was right. In terms of “staying safe,” from an artistic career standpoint, I wouldn’t rule out art so easily! There are a lot more opportunities in the media arts field than one would typically think of; graphic designers are always in demand (I still do graphic design work here and there, b/c it’s just so needed); advertising agencies love good storyboard artists & designers, and obviously, there are people working in the animation industry & the videogame industry. The only thing is, that these fields are very competitive! And, I’m not quite sure what your science major is, but from what I hear, the safety net of a science career is also questionable, unless you’re pre-med. Which you really should only pursue if you REALLY REALLY REALLY want to be a doctor.BUT if you really love your craft and think it’s something you can imagine yourself doing for a long time, then go for it! Look into career options, research internships and opportunities. Look at styles you like, and look at the work of working professionals in the field. Build a portfolio, practice, and create. And also understand that most artists don’t really go into these careers looking to make millions, but really out of love for their craft.  Hope that helps! " True text
