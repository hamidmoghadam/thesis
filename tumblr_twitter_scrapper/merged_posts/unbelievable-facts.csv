He had a keen interest in flying airplanes. While Mr. Smith was attending Yale, he had an idea, that of a private delivery service. The postal services then were very slow (comparatively) and he thought he could revolutionize the shipping industry by creating a single company handling from start to finish. Now, since the company handled everything from start to finish, they needed to hire airplanes, which were costly affairs. He put all he had, in the company and worked hard with all his might but the company was out of money. He could not afford fuel for the planes with the amount left with them. The company was counting it’s last breathes. They were left with $5000 while they needed to pay the airlines $24000 to stay in the market. No deliveries meant reputation of company is gone and no further trust from the customers. So, this man says, “Well we cannot do anything with just $5000, so let’s take a risk.” Thus, he took those last 5000 Dollars, goes to Vegas and plays blackjack with that money to win the money for survival. Let me repeat it, he took those last freaking $5000 the company had in it’s account, put them on blackjack, hoping that the winnings would help his company survive. And the stroke of luck, he wins! He won $27000 in blackjack, flew back to office and whew! just like that, he began the success journey of his multi billion dollar company, also known as FedEx. " False text

In Today’s world social networks like Facebook and Twitter both use user-generated content to generate profits for their shareholders with no money going back to the user. Now this has been the norm ever since the beginning of this digital age, but a revolutionary idea has come along looking to change everything around. Tsu (pronounced ‘Sue’) is the first social network that is opening up its bank to share 90% of the revenue generated with it’s users. It just launched on the 21st, and its algorithm intends to re-distribute sales revenue directly to its source. TSU also works on an invite-only basis. DO YOU WANT TO JOIN? CLICK HERE FOR AN INVITE FROM US TO YOU.   According to Tsu’s founder, Sebastian Sobczak:  “Established social networks have built amazing business models prospering on the total monetization of free user-generated content. Why should anyone commercially benefit from someone else’s image, likeness and work giving no financial return to the owner? The markets we participate in are enormous, growing and can materially compensate each user — we’re simply and uniquely rewarding the users who are doing all the work. This is the way the world should work.”  At a glance, Tsu seems to work in the same way as any other social network. Page views generate ad revenue, but what sets them apart is that only 10% of that ad revenue is returned to Tsu. 50% of ad revenue is sent to the content owner. The other 50% is given to the user who brought the content owner into the network. Where as any other network keeps 100% of the profit for themselves! CONFUSED? I WAS A LITTLE AT FIRST TOO. That 50% of profits propagates in a series of infinite thirds up a ‘family tree’ of users that begin with the original content owner. The person who invited him is the parent, and they get a third. The person who invited that person is a ‘grandparent’ and received a third of that third. So it’s like one giant pay-it-forward platform. So make sure to invite all your friends because Tsu only works if we decide we want it to. So Join the social media revolution and take back ownership of your social content. Sounds pretty awesome, right!? Click here if you’d like to join, and be sure to be one of the first people to follow us too." True text

Myth:Your fingernails and toenails continue to grow even after your death.Fact: They appear to grow because your skin surrounding them shrinks, giving an illusion that they are growing. Myth: If you touch a baby bird, its mother will abandon it(our scent would cause their parents to reject and abandon them).Fact: Birds will not readily abandon their young because they “smell humans.” For one thing, birds don’t have a great sense of smell. Their olfactory bulbs are small and simple compared to other animals. Myth: During a nose bleed, tilt your head back to help stop the bleeding.Fact: All this does is make the blood run down your throat. Just because blood is no longer visibly leaking from your nose does not mean that you are no longer loosing blood, only that gravity has diverted the blood in to an even more inconvenient direction. Myth:You only use 5-10% of your brain.Facts: In reality, the 10 percent claim is 100 percent myth. You use all of your brain. The only instances where there are unused regions of the brain are those in which brain damage or disease has destroyed certain regions. Myth: The number of people alive today is greater than the number of people who have ever died.Fact: BBC News spoke to the Population Reference Bureau in Washington DC, and they estimate that about 107 billion people have been born since humanity first emerged, which they set 50,000 years ago. Myth: Cracking your knuckles doesn’t give you arthritis.Fact: Cracking your knuckles may aggravate the people around you, but it probably won’t raise your risk for arthritis. That’s the conclusion of several studies that compared rates of hand arthritis among habitual knuckle-crackers and people who didn’t crack their knuckles. Myth: NASA spent millions developing a pen that worked in zero-gravity, where soviet cosmonauts used pencils.Fact: Originally, NASA astronauts, like the Soviet cosmonauts, used pencils, according to NASA historians. In fact, NASA ordered 34 mechanical pencils from Houston’s Tycam Engineering Manufacturing, Inc., in 1965. They paid $4,382.50 or $128.89 per pencil. When these prices became public, there was an outcry and NASA scrambled to find something cheaper for the astronauts to use. Myth: You will burn the same number of calories walking a mile as you will running a mileFact: In fact you burn more calories in running 1mile rather than walking same distance.(read more here) Myth: Your fingers wrinkle when they’re wet because they absorb water.Fact: Research based theory: pruney fingers are an adaptation to help humans, and probably other primates, get a better grip during wet conditions. more facts?"
