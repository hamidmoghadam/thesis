Page Six is reporting that Anna Wintour had 10 designers (including Vera Wang, Valentino, and Oscar de la Renta) pick out their “ideal” dresses for the supermodel, and then had Testino photograph Kate in the designs, as well as her actual John Galliano gown. Sound familiar? Yup, it’s pretty much the exact same thing that happens to Carrie in the first Sex and the City movie." True text

I be figuring you at least want one of them items. Like, ‘Damn, I’d love to have that safety pin he got on,’ you know what I mean? Anything.

Here we go:  How do you feel about Karl Lagerfeld? I don’t like his fashion, his spirit, his attitude. It’s too much caricature. Karl Lagerfeld never touched a pair of scissors in his life. That doesn’t mean that he’s not great, but he’s part of another system.  He has capacity. One day he does photography, the next he does  advertisements for Coca-Cola. I would rather die than see my face in a  car advertisement. We don’t do the same work. And I think that he is not doing a favor to young stylists who might think it works that way. They’re going to fall before they retire.  And here’s what Alaia had to say Wintour:  I said it before. She runs the business (Vogue) very well, but not the fashion part. When I see how she is dressed, I don’t believe in her tastes one second. I can say it loudly! She hasn’t photographed my work in years even if I  am a best seller in the U.S. and I have 140 square meters at Barneys.  American women love me; I don’t need her support at all. Anna Wintour  doesn’t deal with pictures; she is just doing PR and business, and she  scares everybody. But when she sees me, she is the scared one. [Laughs.] Other people think like me, but don’t say it because they are afraid that Vogue won’t photograph them. Anyway, who will remember Anna Wintour in the history of fashion? No one. Take Diana Vreeland, she is remembered because she was so chic. What  she did with the magazine was great, with Avedon and all the great  photographers. Vogue remains while its fashion editors come and go.  He better have 3 seats cause while he will never be forgotten Anna Wintour wont be either. Virgine Magazine" True text

He said staying in the black ensures that’s not a problem  for his company.  “I don’t have debts. Instead, Prada’s problem is that  they have to pay back the money that the banks spent to build up the  brand.” “There are thousands of ways to make money. But for me, I don’t  want to wind up having to knock on the door of some Thai managers to  explain myself.”  Naturally, the Italian press has been thrown into what Women’s Wear Daily calls a tizzy — Armani, Prada and Dolce and Gabbana are all national  treasures and global fashion phenomenons. To have one insulting the  others is sort of a big deal. Especially when the insults are really,  really insulting.  He said that Prada chief Miuccia Prada was “ingenious”  for her “irony…and bad taste that becomes chic.” But he complained that  certain collections that are “sometimes ugly” always get positive  coverage in the press. “You know why…”  Word is both Dolce and Gabbana and Prada are refusing comment."
