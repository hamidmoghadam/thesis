My thoughts and prayers go to the people of Marawi  not actually ISIS, but the Maute  (Islamic State of Lanao)    group. they are not ISIS, but they have pledged allegiance to ISIS, which is (probably) why they are taking down Philippine flags and raising ISIS flags in place of them in buildings and police cars around the city. what we know about the attack as of now; the Marawi City jail and Dansalan College are on fire.  all electricity lines throughout the city have been cut. the entire city is experiencing a blackout. President Duterte has declared Martial Law in Mindanao from Russia.

Research indicated that such diseases could be fatal after all. The organ did something similar to the flagulaxin in that it filtered out toxins so when it stopped functioning the human would slowly be poisoned to death by his own body. Or so they believed. But then he came back. A foot soldier was captured and answers demanded. Was it a medication? Had the sickeness been a ruse to fool them? “Nah, man. This kid on a motorcycle wiped out on the I9 freeway so they gave the general his liver since they were a match.” “They…what?” “They gave him his liver. The kid was dead, and he was an organ donor. And he was a genetic match to the general.” “They…cut the liver out of one of your young and placed it in an elder and it…worked?” “I mean, he wasn’t that young. Mid twenties or something. But yeah, that’s essentially it.” The interrogator and his assistant both regurgitated their most recent meal and ran from the room. Living in places like the “Australia” were one thing, but taking the organs of dead bodies and placing them in the living? What was WRONG with this species?  This is me cackling. Because if I did it out loud I’d wake the household.  Let’s go one step further. Let’s discuss immunizations. Early variations included sticking bits of the dead disease into living tissue. “So, let me get this straight- you used to take remains from a potentially fatal virus and inject into a healthy person in order to get them sick with a weaker strain so they wouldn’t get the more virulent strain?” “Yes.” “And it worked?” “Yes.”  On that note. Let’s discuss the idea of surgery itself. Or hell don’t get me on the idea of dialysis and other medical interventions of once deadly diseases.We as a species have discovered through horrifying means how to heal ourselves and each other. There is a reason the operating room is known as the Operating theater. It used to be an open vent that other doctors and nurses and even the public -though sometimes discouraged- could sit in on and observe and learn.Even now some surgeries are only done on local anesthesia. If you have a strong stomach you could watch them cut open your knee and repair it. We use metal and carbon fiber to put ourselves back together again; screws and struts and plates and wires and we don;t think a thing of it. Hip surgery with ball bearings essentially. Let’s put a mesh trap in your vein to hold it open!We poison ourselves to make ourselves better. Willingly and knowingly because we as a species refuse to fucking die. " False text

Food should be lower on your priority list. You need to immediately put up protection against animals like wolves.Friend, you watch too many movies. Many people who have lived in the wood their whole lives can say they have never had a scare of an attacking bear or wolf pack. Sure bears might wander on in due to curiosity, but they are also lazy and much more prefer an easy meal, so no need to build castle walls. A big fire is normally enough. Water must be boiled 10, 15, or 20 minutes to ensure safety.Water must only reach the point of boiling; that’s it. The amount of time it takes for this to happen may vary due to altitude and other factors, so timing it is not a reliable method.  Boiling water makes it safe to drink.Boiling water only makes it safer to drink. Other filtration methods should still be used. Alcohol will keep you from freezing to death.Actually, while alcohol does make you feel warmer, it does not actually warm you. In fact, some studies show that it might actually kill you faster. Fast moving water is always safe to drink.The speed of the water does not actually mean you are safe from things that will make you sick. Remember, you never know what is up stream from you. Moss always grows on the north side of the tree.Moss will grow wherever there is a right amount of shade a moisture, which may sometimes be on the north side of the tree, but then again, it also may not. With a snake bite, you should suck or cut(bleed) the venom out.Once the venom is there, it’s there. Sucking it out will only put the venom in your mouth, and cutting it will simply put your body in more shock than it already is. Best thing you can do is put ice on it, and keep your heart rate down. Doing that will lower the speed of the venom spreading which might lesson the shock upon your heart. Keep calm, and get anti-venom. Wet clothes are better then no clothes.Water has a nasty habit of holding on to it’s temperature for long periods of time, so if you have just fallen through ice and you get out and keep your clothes on, all you are doing is keeping yourself cold. You are better off naked than in wet clothes. You should follow a river if lost.While a river can lead to human life, it can sometimes take weeks or more to get there, while meanwhile you are completely invading a search squad trying to find you. Survival on the go is also much harder then stationary survival; you tend to spend too much time traveling than working to survive. Stay in one spot, survive, wait for help to arrive. Wait a day or more to see if help arrives before starting anything.Always, always, plan as if help is not coming. Hope they do, plan as if they wont. You should ration your water.Never ration your water. If you are thirsty, have a sit in the shade and have a drink while you cool off. Rationing water and pushing on will only help to cause heat stroke, which in some cases has killed people before running out of water has.

My new column at The Week is about that:  Trump’s allegations produced outrage and incredulity; Conway’s comments got pure mockery. Late-night comedians had a field day, with Stephen Colbert revealing one of his on-set cameras is, in fact, a kitchen appliance. We got tinfoil hat jokes, and spying Roomba jokes, and soon enough Conway was walking back her claim. But why? Internet of things surveillance — basically, your smart devices being able to spy on you — is a real and serious concern. Set aside, for a moment, the facts (or lack thereof) about this specific surveillance allegation. If you do, then absolutely nothing about Conway’s microwave statement is crazy. Remember that story about Samsung’s smart TVs back in 2015? The company outright warned its customers against having private conversations in front of this product. “Please be aware that if your spoken words include personal or other sensitive information, that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party,” Samsung said. The information wasn’t sold to other businesses or shipped straight over to NSA headquarters, of course, but the fact is that smart devices transmitting data poses a security risk — enough of a risk that Samsung gave this word of caution. Or what about that talking Barbie doll? Equipped with a mic, artificial intelligence à la the iPhone’s Siri assistant, and a Wi-Fi connection, Hello Barbie listened to what little kids said and answered back. Researchers soon found they could “get into the toy’s system to access users’ system information, Wi-Fi network names, internal MAC addresses, account IDs, and MP3 files.” This data could be harnessed to “find someone’s house and personal information, and could access their home network and listen to everything Barbie records.” And it isn’t just televisions and dolls. The former director of national intelligence, James Clapper, said in Senate testimony last year that the federal government is aware of the surveillance potential in the internet of things and has every intention of using those capabilities. “In the future, intelligence services might use the [internet of things] for identification, surveillance, monitoring, location tracking, and targeting for recruitment, or to gain access to networks or user credentials,” he said.

It’s Question 5, and if it passes, Maine will use ranked voting instead of first past the post.

Do I really have to pick? 3. Seriously, though, there are so many problems with both of them Then, if the meteor didn’t win outright, there’d be an instant runoff election which would eliminate the least popular contender(s) and use people’s second and third choices and on the down the list until one candidate got a majority.  I’ve gone over this further at the link, but here’s the takeaway: With this kind of voting, we can get away from a two-party system.  “A ranked system significantly favors third-party candidates in situations where voters are really unhappy with what the establishment has to offer,” explains Reason’s Scott Shackford using this election as an example. “It’s easy to imagine Johnson becoming the second choice for a good chunk of voters, and then imagine what could happen next if neither Clinton nor Trump gets 51 percent of the majority vote.” If this passes and works well in Maine, it could spread to other states. Of course, the major parties would fight it tooth and nail, especially in bigger states than Maine, but it could happen—and this is the single best way to get viable third parties without multiple (and highly unlikely) constitutional amendments. So, Mainers: Vote “yes” on Question 5!  UPDATE: Ranked voting won! " False link

Second, Geofeedia will continue to gain customers in local police departments across the country. And third, once those accounts are created and those surveillance abilities gained, this will be a difficult overgrowth of government to root out. Pro-liberty activists should begin proactively addressing this issue at the state and city level, pushing for prohibitions on police use of Geofeedia specifically and mass social media surveillance by law enforcement in general.

That’s what happened in Mitchell’s case. A month after his arrest, he got a letter saying he could contest the seizure in court. The only catch was a he’d have to pay a filing fee…of $175, more than the money he’s trying to get back. There’s no way he can win here, even if he’s found innocent in his criminal case. Hudson County, the jurisdiction where this happened, is apparently notorious for pulling this crap. According to the civil liberties lawyer fighting Mitchell’s case on his behalf, the county has already seized money from 500 people in 2016, and almost half of them lost less than $175, which makes contesting the seizure more trouble than it’s worth. It’s basically free money for county government, an invisible tax local politicians never have to mention to voters. " False link
