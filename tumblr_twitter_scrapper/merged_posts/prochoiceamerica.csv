Here’s What the Bill Actually Does, and How to Fight Back. On May 4, the U.S. House voted to pass the worst bill for women’s health in a generation: the American Health Care Act (AHCA). This bill not only seeks to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA), but also to “defund” Planned Parenthood by blocking Medicaid patients from care at its health centers.  As the bill heads to the Senate, here’s what it actually does — and what it doesn’t do. What Thursday’s Vote Did NOT Do  It didn’t become law.The ACA repeal bill passed the House by a narrow margin, and now it faces an uphill battle in the Senate. We can expect more changes to the bill that will impact women’s health.  It didn’t close Planned Parenthood.All Planned Parenthood health centers are open as usual, and staff are doing what they’ve always done: getting up in the morning; opening the health center doors; and providing high-quality, affordable health care to all people who need it. That includes patients who rely on Medicaid coverage.  It didn’t cancel your insurance.The benefits of the ACA are still here for you. The majority of people can still purchase a plan for $75 or less. If you have health care coverage, it is still in effect until there is an actual change in the law, which takes time. This includes people who are 26 or younger and on their parents’ plan. Make your medical appointments, and get the care you deserve and are entitled to under the law. What the AHCA Threatens to Do to Women’s Health In particular, the AHCA would: Take away health coverage for 24 million people  “Defund” Planned Parenthood by blocking people who rely on Medicaid from accessing preventive care at its health centers — including birth control, cancer screenings, and STD testing and treatment Reduce access to no-cost preventive services, including birth control End protections that keep insurers from charging people with pre-existing conditions unaffordable rates — allowing insurance companies to once again charge people tens of thousands of dollars a month because they had cancer Impose a nationwide ban on private insurance coverage of abortion  Undermine Essential Health Benefits — including maternity coverage and prescription drugs, which disproportionately affect women.  Gut the Medicaid program, which approximately 1 in 4 women of reproductive age rely on to access no-cost, critical reproductive health care (such as birth control, lifesaving cancer screenings, and maternity care) 4 Ways to Fight Back Now Infuriated? You’re not alone. Here are the top three ways to stand up for health care and stand with Planned Parenthood right now. #1: Call Your SenatorsThis is the most important way to take action right now. Use our easy online form to call your U.S. senators. We’ll give you a script so you can tell them to protect health care and stand with Planned Parenthood. #2: Tag Your Senators on FacebookDo you notice when somebody tags you on Facebook?

Depending on your sources, the wage gap varies, but it really isn’t the fundamental issue when we are looking at pay inequality in the US.  There are many other factors that come into play when talking about PAY GAPS: Women have less success in gaining promotions than their male counter parts (and other Glass Ceiling effects), women are dissuaded from higher paying fields (such as STEM fields) through institutional hostility, women are expected to take unpaid maternity leave for child care when men are not (regardless of whether or not they will), women are less successful at salary negotiations and are sometimes even penalized by employers for trying at MUCH higher rates than men, work that is traditionally female dominated being undervalued on a cultural level (women might be cooks, but not chefs; nurses, not doctors; etc.), when women begin to work in traditionally male fields in higher numbers the pay for those fields drop, and men in traditionally female fields tend to be promoted more quickly and get paid more, and a myriad of others. We know, for example Women need an additional degree in order to make as much as men with a lower degree over the course of a lifetime.A woman would need a doctoral degree, for instance, to earn the same as a man with a bachelor’s degree, and a man with a high school education would earn approximately the same amount as a woman with a bachelor’s degree. The fact is that women, on average, DO make less than men, and the issue isn’t always direct illegal wage imbalance. The issues are often far more wide reaching and speak to a cultural misogyny that has to be confronted beyond just legislation. I mentioned maternity leave earlier. (Did you know that the US is one of the only “industrialized countries” in the world to NOT have guaranteed paid parental leave? yeah. That’s fucked up.) The entire notion that women, more so than men, are expected to take off time from work for family is one of those cultural aspects of inequality that I mentioned.  And all this discussion fails to take into account things like disability, trans people, sexuality, and race, which makes all of these issues even more extreme and complicated. This is a really good article to read for more information: Explaining the Wage Gap  This is my shit! fandomsandfeminism talked about several of the major contributors to the wage gap, including: 1. Discrimination in promotions Women are typically overqualified compared to their male counterparts, are promoted less frequently, and are passed over for promotions when they have the same experiences and qualifications as men. For example, white male professors who do the least service and mentoring get promoted the fastest. Female managers are also held to stricter standards for promotion than men. Women with more than a high school education do not leave jobs more frequently than men, and female managers even have slightly lower turnover than male managers.  2. Dissuasion from higher paying fields Millennial men are less open to accepting women engineers than older men are. Only 41% of millennial men are comfortable with women engineers, compared to 65% of men 65 or older. Women get burned out working in the tech industry because they are underpaid, undervalued, and underappreciated in their Millennial male-dominated fields.  3. Structural disadvantage Paid family leave is not mandated in the US, but women are more likely to return to work after having a baby when they have paid family leave, and men who take paternity leave spend more time on child care later. Investing in a universal, free childcare system, in which workers are paid a decent wage, would create 1.65 million jobs and reduce the gender pay gap. Most of the investment would be recouped through increased tax revenues and lower welfare spending. In Canada, women’s participation in the workforce increased substantially above trend levels when marginal taxes and the net costs of child care were reduced.  4. Penalties for negotiating Both men and women are more likely to rate women as “less nice” and are less interested in working with them if they ask for more money. Women are aware of how they’ll be viewed if they ask for more money, and therefore don’t ask. Women ask for much more money if they’re negotiating for someone else because they don’t have to fear appearing selfish and greedy. Employers outright lie to women more often during negotiations. Furthermore, a recent study in Australia found women ask for pay raises at the same rate as men but receive them less. 19% of women vs. 33% of men got raises when they asked.  5. The devaluing of work associated with women People view men’s and women’s work differently. There is a tipping point at which men flee an occupation, and in the absence of perfect information, workers take the percentage of female employees as a proxy for an occupation’s prestige. When teaching in the US became female-dominated, the pay decreased. When programming in the US became male-dominated, the pay increased. Doctors save lives and go to school for many years no matter where you are in the world. But in Russia, they are paid the same wages as secretaries, making about 12,000 US dollars a year. A study of Census data from 1950 to 2000 found that when women enter an occupation in large numbers, that job begins to pay less, even after controlling for a range of factors like skill, race, geography, and occupational crowding. Men’s low-wage jobs demand far less in terms of skill, education, and certifications than women’s low-wage jobs, yet the male-dominated ones usually have higher hourly pay. Janitors, who are mostly men, make 22 percent more money than maids and housecleaners, who are mostly women, despite the jobs requiring identical skills.  6. Special treatment for men in female-dominated fields Even in even in job fields where women dominate, men are paid more for the same roles. Men in nursing outearn women by nearly $7,700 per year in outpatient settings and nearly $3,900 in hospitals in the US after controlling for a large number of variables. Men in female-dominated fields aren’t marginalized at all; they get special treatment, are fast-tracked to the top, and receive preferential hiring (often by other men who were also fast-tracked to the top).  7. Disabled people, trans people, gay people, and people of color also see wage gaps with their more privileged counterparts  There are many other important reasons for the wage gap, including: 8. Pay secrecy You can’t demand higher pay if you don’t know you’re being underpaid. In the 11 US states where pay secrecy is unlawful, the gender wage gap is smaller. In government jobs, where pay transparency is required, the gender pay gap has shrunk to just 11-13 percent. Unionized workers, who also require pay transparency, have a wage gap of 9 percent.  9. Women’s unpaid labor Women tend to put in fewer hours of paid work than men, but when unpaid work is added to the equation, women all over the world tend to work slightly more hours per day, per week, and per year than men. Women in the US proportionately still perform much more housework and childcare, such as managing children’s schedules and activities, taking care of sick children, and doing chores, than men. Men still perform only half the housework and childcare that women do. This doesn’t look like it will change soon: Fewer than half of Millennial women believed they’ll handle most of the child care, but two-thirds of their male peers believe their wives will do so. When the time women spend on unpaid work shrinks to three hours a day from five hours, their labor force participation increases 20 percent.  10. Long hours != greater contribution to company The worth of work should be evaluated by productivity rather than time. Long hours backfire for people and companies. Managers can’t tell the difference between those who worked an 80-hour week and those who pretend to. Pharmacists have one of the smallest wage gaps because the pay is measured by productivity rather than time. Even in workplaces that offer flexibility, however, women have reported penalties for taking advantage of flexible work options, such as loss of responsibility or longer hours than promised. Flexible work hours will work only if that attitude changes. The point that “men earn more because they put in more hours at the company” is untrue anyway. The wage gap between women and men remains steady whether we compare employees working 40 hours a week, 41-44 hours a week, 45-49 hours a week, or  50+ hours a week.  11. Motherhood penalty Women earn 10% less for each child they have, while men earn 6% more for each child they have. Mothers face a lot of stereotypes at work: they get competency ratings 10% lower than other women, and they’re also called back half as often as fathers for jobs. To the contrary, studies have found that moms are more productive workers. The thought-leadership industrial complex has even called having kids a “productivity hack.”  12. Implicit bias Even after controlling for all variables known to affect earnings, there is still a wage gap of about 6.6% in the US. Accounting for these variables explains only about 60% of the wage gap in the US. In Australia, these factors only account for about 40% of the gap. There are almost innumerable examples demonstrating implicit gender bias. Resumes with women’s names are given 12% lower starting salaries than the exact same resumes with men’s names. Employers are more likely to hire a male job applicant than a female job applicant with an identical record. Employers reported that the male job applicant had done adequate teaching, research, and service experience compared to the female job applicant with an identical record. If there is only one woman in a pool of candidates, her chances of being hired are statistically zero. Mentoring does not provide the same career benefits to women as men and that women are “championed” less often by senior management for promotions and raises. Luckily, people can overcome their unconscious biases. Employers for university STEM faculty were 6.3 times more likely to make an offer to a woman candidate when the employers had been presented with an intervention, including discussion of implicit bias. Sadly, women who bring up concerns about diversity in the workplace receive worse evaluations from their bosses than men who bring up the same concerns.  13. Just blatant sexism Married men with stay-at-home wives are significantly more likely to view women in their workplace unfavorably, are much less likely to take jobs at companies with female board members, and pass over female co-workers for promotions. Three-quarters of Millennial women anticipate that their careers will be at least as important as their partners, while half the men in their generation expect that their own careers will take priority. Women are not as respected as men in leadership roles, especially by the men over whom they have a leadership role. Women in leadership positions receive less favorable evaluations because they are perceived to be violating gender norms. Male students systematically overestimate the knowledge of the men in their classes in comparison with the women despite clear evidence of women’s superior class performance. Millennial men are less open to accepting women leaders than older men are. Only 41% of millennial men are comfortable with women engineers, compared to 65% of men 65 or older. Likewise, only 43% of millennial men are comfortable with women being U.S. senators, compared to 64% of Americans overall. The numbers were 39% versus 61% for women being CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, and 35% versus 57% for president of the United States. There are many proven ways to reduce the gender wage gap, including:  Mandate paid family leave.  Invest in universal, free childcare, or at least invest in reducing marginal taxes and the net cost of childcare. Confront implicit bias through training and intervention. Raise the minimum wage. Mandate pay transparency. Prohibit employers from inquiring into prospective employees’ wage histories. Create more flexibility for jobs by valuing productivity over contact hours. Remind workers of their rights. Perform your fair share of unpaid labor. Change cultural norms so it is more acceptable for moms to work and dads to take care of children. Support women’s ideas in your workplace. When a female colleague’s point is ignored, pile on and emphasize the point, making sure you acknowledge that it was her idea. When a qualified female colleague is consistently passed over for a promotion, ask your boss to promote her. But we can’t get any of these done because these idiots are out here plugging their ears and saying “the wage gap isn’t real.”. If you need more convincing of why you should help the gender pay gap, please read this post.  The wage gap is real, it’s pervasive, and it can be closed." False text

Nellie Bly - Nellie Bly entered the journalism scene in an unabashedly feminist way, by submitting a letter to The Pittsburgh Dispatch that rebutted one writer’s diatribe about how women belonged in the home. An editor saw Bly’s potential and hired her in 1885. Just two years later, Bly famously posed as a mental patient on Blackwell’s Island for a New York World expose; a few years after, she that took a record-setting, 72-day trip around the world, writing about it for the same paper.  Agent 355 - Long before 007, there was 355. History books would do well to liven their account of the American Revolution by mentioning  this member of the Culper Spy Ring, America’s  first elite spy network. One of George Washington’s most valuable  spies, the woman known only as “Agent 355” was likely the only one who  could rock an evening gown while gathering information critical to the  colonies’ achieving independence.  Murasaki Shikibu - Little is known about the Japanese author credited with writing the world’s first modern novel, The Tale of Genji, other than that she certainly overcame plenty of obstacles to do so. Even her  name is an invention, drawn from one of the novel’s characters and the  author’s father’s job, according to Encyclopaedia Brittanica. Not only  was Shikibu educated — a rarity for women at any point for most of  history, but especially around the year 1010 — but she also became  literate in both Japanese and Chinese.  Maria W. Stewart - Though her name is (unfortunately) not one often included in history books, Stewart can claim plenty of impressive firsts. She was  the first American woman to speak to an audience of mixed genders and  races, as well as one of the first African American woman to deliver any public speech at all.  Pauli Murray - Pauli Murray wore many hats, and each one was equally impressive. Murray became a civil rights  lawyer in the late 1940s, a particularly impressive feat given that  women in general, let alone black women, had been prohibited from becoming lawyers only decades before.

prochoiceamerica 145570384416 "2016-06-07 19:20:36 GMT" http://prochoiceamerica.tumblr.com/post/145570384416/5-tips-for-talking-to-your-lgbtq-child-about "parentsproject:  by Ellen Kate Talking the Talk A number of years ago, I was at a conference where I gave a presentation on the challenges LGBT+ kids face accessing accurate information online.  After the presentation, a woman approached me. She was a nurse and there professionally, but the reason she wanted to talk was that her 14-year-old son had just come out as gay, and she was terrified that he was now at greater risk for HIV. This mom explained that she felt ill equipped to talk to her son about sex given his revelation. She was struggling with how to offer support, get him needed information, and do so without making the whole experience super uncomfortable. I was thinking back on this conversation recently, since while the issue of how to talk to our kids about sex can be a complicated one for everyone, for parents of queer youth, doing so can raise some additional issues. So, here are 5 things parents of LGBT teens can keep in mind when gearing up for the sex talk. 1) Don’t Assume a Teen’s Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity Is Just About “Sex.” A lot of people confuse sexual orientation and gender identity with sexual activity. Yet for plenty of queer kids, this is more related to identity and community than it is to sexual behavior.  Still many people default to focusing on the sex side. And while sex will likely be a part of your child’s life at some point, and one that is probably going to be colored by their sexual orientation or gender identity, if that kid is on the younger side, it is very possible that sex with another person won’t be on the table for a while. Having a conversation where you acknowledge the vast range of ways to express sexual orientation and gender that doesn’t only focus on sex acts can send a positive message about your views of your child’s relationship to this aspect of who they are. 2) Talk About Specific Sex Acts, Not About Lesbian or Gay Sex Though there is a temptation to remind lesbian youth to stock up on dental dams, or to focus on anal sex with gay teens, the range of sex acts an adolescent might participate in aren’t defined by their sexual orientation or gender identity. For example, plenty of gay men never have anal sex, and plenty of lesbian teens do. Plus, for a whole host of reasons, lesbian, gay and bisexual teens are actually have a greater likelihood for teen pregnancy than youth in the general population. Because of this, discussing birth control, including emergency contraception, is crucial. But since we often assume that a queer kid is not having the kind of sex that could result in a pregnancy, this element of the conversation is too often overlooked. When talking to trans teens, it is also important  to both respect their gender identities, and also to acknowledge the reality of the bodies they have. For example, for some trans boys this will mean conversations about periods and gynecological care. When we term sex itself as “gay” or “lesbian” we rely on stereotypes of what we imagine these encounters to look like and a lot of useful information can get lost in the process. 3) Be Prepared to Counter Some Misinformation In schools across the United States, if students get sex ed at all, it is often of the abstinence-only variety. This form of education leaves out crucial information and is notoriously homophobic and transphobic. Curricula may vastly overstate the risk of acquiring HIV for gay teens. Or they might talk about how being gay will lead to depression and suicide without addressing the fact that these correlations are related to lacking support, being forced to hide one’s identity in the face of hostility, and being rejected by school and family, and are not directly the result of someone’s sexual orientation or gender identity. There is also the issue of porn. Like a lot of teens, LGBT+ teens, may come across porn long before they are legally old enough to do so.  And while there is nothing morally wrong with being interested in images of sex, the information one gets about how intimate situations transpire is far from accurate. Sex in porn is often aggressive and violent, and safer sex is rarely addressed. Plus, men typically have huge penises, while women tend to be hairless and have large, often augmented breasts. What is termed “lesbian sex” is usually sex between women, portrayed in a way designed to appeal to straight men. Porn involving trans folks is often billed using offensive and dehumanizing terms. Teens need to know that porn sex and real sex simply aren’t the same thing. It’s not that LGBT+ teens don’t have any access to sexual information, but so often that info is just way off the mark, and as parents you have the power to correct this. 4) Don’t make the sex talk a one time thing.   A lot of parents gird themselves for a sex talk that they expect will be an awkward exchange ending with the offer that, “You can come to me with any questions.” That’s often something both parties know is unlikely to happen. And while this scenario plays out all the time, it doesn’t have to. One of the best ways to prevent such a situation is to make sure that the sex talk is an ongoing conversation, not a one time thing. Speaking of those conversations, you can let your child know if sex is hard for you to talk about, and say something like, “Look, I’m not an expert and I’m not used to talking about this, so I may mess up a bit.”  A lot of parents never had these conversations when they were growing up and have to learn on the fly. Letting your kids know this is one easy way to level the playing field a bit. 5) Do Your Homework Having a sex talk can be nerve wracking if you don’t know the answers to a child’s question. You can always offer to look something up that you don’t know.  But if you want to do some advance research, you can check out this list of 32 common sex questions from queer youth on the LGBT+ Teens site that I ran for years. It would also be helpful to read up on some basic sex ed.  Al Vernacchio’s For Goodness Sex: Changing the Way We Talk to Teens About Sexuality, Values, and Health is a great place to start. Vernacchio, who is gay himself, is a teacher, writer, and speaker and has a lot of good insight! The more prepared you are, the more comfortable you will ultimately be having this conversation with your child. What it All Comes Down to Though talking about sex can seem terrifying, it can also be a lot easier than parents think.  And once you arm yourself with a little knowledge, doing so can not only be a great way to help your kids stay safe and healthy, but it can also be a way for you to connect with them and offer support around an issue that can be a real struggle for LGBT+ youth. *** Help support our contributors here on Patreon!

Of all the stupid things to claim, this is a topper. While abortion has never been a lucrative procedure, it is largely a money-loser today, only sustainable through intense fundraising through charitable foundations. Between the punitive regulations visited upon clinics through the TRAP laws passed by Republican statehouses, the dirty tricks and mischief perpetrated by anti-choice contractors and technicians (one clinic got stood up by its phone installer four times), and the need to pay for security against the rampant domestic terror cells that operate with impunity, abortion clinics are in such dire financial straits that they’re shutting down at record rates. To top it all off, state agencies routinely and illegally discriminate against abortion providers. Even NPR stations won’t let them buy airtime; KMUW in Wichita refused to allow Julie Burkhart to buy ad time for a nonprofit pro-choice charity, comparing it to taking money from the Ku Klux Klan. http://boingboing.net/2016/02/26/the-biggest-abortion-lie-of-al.html " False text

When Aristotle Said Women Are Defective Men “The female is a female by virtue of a certain lack of qualities; we should regard the female nature as afflicted with a natural defectiveness.” 2. When St. Thomas Aquinas Said Women Are Sperm Accidents “… A female is deficient and unintentionally caused. For the active power of the semen always seeks to produce a thing completely like itself, something male. So if a female is produced, this must be because the semen is weak or because the material [provided by the female parent] is unsuitable, or because of the action of some external factor such as the winds from the south which make the atmosphere humid.” 3. When Napoleon Said Women Are Just Slaves “Nature intended women to be our slaves… they are our property; we are not theirs. They belong to us, just as a tree that bears fruit belongs to a gardener…. Women are nothing more than machines for producing children.” 4. When Cato The Elder Argued That All Women Are Wild Animals “Woman is a violent and uncontrolled animal, and it is useless to let go the reins and then expect her not to kick over the traces. You must keep her on a tight rein…. Women want total freedom or rather – to call things by their names – total licence. If you allow them to achieve complete equality with men, do you think they will be easier to live with? Not at all. Once they have achieved equality, they will be your masters.” 5. When Pliny The Elder Warned That Menstrual Blood Is Poisonous “On the approach of a woman in this state, must will become sour, seeds which are touched by her become sterile, grafts wither away, garden plants are parched up, and the fruit will fall from the tree beneath which she sits. Her very look, even, will dim the brightness of mirrors, blunt the edge of steel, and take away the polish from ivory. A swarm of bees, if looked upon by her, will die immediately.” 6. When Plutarch Did Not Approve Of Independent Lady-Emotions “A wife should have no feelings of her own, but share her husband’s seriousness and sport, his anxiety and his laughter.” 7. When Friedrich Nietzsche Was Basically Just Friedrich Nietzsche “Finally – woman! One-half of mankind is weak, typically sick, changeable, inconstant – woman needs a religion of weakness that glorifies being weak, loving, being humbled as divine.” 8. When Jean-Jacques Rousseau Said Ladies Only Need To Be Taught About Men “The whole education of women ought to be relative to men. To please them, to be useful to them, to make themselves loved and honored by them, to educate them when young, to care for them when grown, to council them, to console them, and to make life agreeable and sweet to them – these are the duties of women at all times, and should be taught them from their infancy.” 9. When Sigmund Freud Despaired Of Grown Ladies’ Sexuality “The sexual life of adult women is a ‘dark continent’ for psychology.” 10.

In some countries, women go to prison just for having an abortion, period.Abortion access isn’t just about our reproductive health — it’s about our most basic human rights. The right to control our bodies, futures and lives. The right to decide if, when and with whom to start a family. These restrictive laws are robbing women of that right.Rebecca Gomperts has been working for years to change that. After her travels around the world with Greenpeace, she witnessed women suffering without access to birth control, safe abortions and other reproductive health care. That’s why she started Women on Waves in 1999. “It all started when I was a ship’s doctor in countries where abortion was illegal,” she said. “I had seen a lot of women brought in because of illegal abortions. I could not observe that and just let it happen.”Women on Waves operates by docking in international waters, 12 miles off the coast of nations where abortion is illegal. They can provide early medical abortions on the ship safely, professionally and legally under Dutch law, which applies on board the ship. “It’s about defying laws without breaking them,” Gomperts said.They’ve traveled to Ireland, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and Morocco to ensure women have access to the reproductive health care they need, without interference from anti-choice politicians and extremists.“Nobody really knows what it means to have an unwanted pregnancy unless you are in this situation, and that is why no one can make a decision for anybody else,” Gomperts said.The incredible work Women on Waves does inspired the 2014 film Vessel, which follows the ship as it sails to the countries where it’s needed most.The response to the work Women on Waves has done and the lives they’ve changed across the world was so overwhelming, Rebecca Gomperts also started Women on Web, a service that helps women in these countries get the drugs they need to induce abortion at home.“I am there to support the lives of women,” she said. “When women have unwanted pregnancies, it will end no matter what. This is an issue about social injustice.”This International Women’s Day, we applaud Rebecca Gomperts for the vital work she does to ensure all women have access to the reproductive health care they need. Reproductive freedom is about the right to control our own lives, bodies and futures — and without access to abortion, we all suffer." True text

As the day gets closer, I’m becoming more afraid. More afraid something is going to go wrong, and I won’t ever be able to have kids if I choose to have them. Trying to find positive articles and information about the abortion I’m getting is so difficult. The searches always end up in judgment and at some pro-life video or website. I’ll be 12 weeks 5 days when I go for the procedure and I feel as though I’m getting a limb amputated because my google searching has just led me to being totally terrified. I feel like I have no clue what’s going to happen. Can you help me relax my mind? Please? I can’t remember the last time I was this scared. Thank you so much if you can! Here’s my personal abortion story. I was about 12 weeks along. It’s all in that link.  To summarize: They’ll do an ultrasound. Some places will ask if you want to see it, some places have to show you due to law. You may also watch a video, so you “know what you’re doing.” You’ll also have a chance to talk to a counselor, to make sure this is for sure the choice you want to make. Once all of that is done, they’ll take you into the procedure room and have you get ready. A nurse will stay with you while you wait for the doctor. In my experience, this nurse stayed by my side the whole procedure and held my hand. The doctor did a pelvic exam, numbed my cervix, and used dilators to open my cervix. Think of really intense menstrual cramps (this is the worst part of the whole procedure, so while uncomfortable it’s not fatal;) it can be really uncomfortable. When my doctor inserted the suction and began the aspiration part of the abortion, it didn’t hurt, but it did feel strange. The best way I can think to explain it is the suction you feel when you put your hands tightly together and pull them apart, except down in your lower tummy. It went very quickly from there.  The whole procedure itself took less than 10 minutes. They watched over me in an after-procedure room for half an hour to make sure everything was OK and then sent me home with some pain reliever and some medication to prevent infections.   Oh! And if you have someone to go with you for the abortion, you’ll be able to get heavy-duty pain reliever, which may help with the worst of the dilator cramps (which is seriously the worst of the whole procedure, but definitely doable so don’t worry too much about that part.) I couldn’t get any anesthetic, because I was alone during my abortion and driving myself home. The article in the link is far more detailed, since I wrote it write after my abortion with the intention to help other people out. Feel free to check out the rest of my Wordpress blog, too. A lot of it has to do with abortion. Also, some links I try to provide for people are generally these:   Not Alone - Started by Emily Letts. A website where people share their positive abortion stories.  1 in 3 Campaign   I Had An Abortion Experience Project - (This one may not be helpful for you, specifically.) Not everyone has a positive abortion experience. This experience project includes everyone.  Thanks, Abortion! - Another place where people share their positive abortion experiences. I don’t think this one has been updated for awhile, though. Planned Parenthood is a good place to start for information. (I’m not sure if you’re going to PP or elsewhere for the abortion.) ((Oh, and you definitely will not be infertile after an abortion. Plenty of people can attest to that.))  I hope those helped you out. If I think of any other things to add on, I’ll be sure to reblog this post with additional information. If any of our followers have any other stories to add in, feel free to add on! The more, the better.  -Mod Al " False text

Mom earned two back-to-back supporting actress wins for one of its central stars, Allison Janney—in 2014 and 2015. (She was nominated in 2016, but lost out to Saturday Night Live’s Kate McKinnon.) But this year, rather than throw down cash for yet another campaign for gold statuettes, CBS will donate the budgeted funds to Planned Parenthood. As the Republicans continue to work toward pushing through their replacement for the Affordable Care Act, Janney and Mom co-creator/executive producer Chuck Lorre have decided to raise awareness around the threats that specifically target Planned Parenthood, Variety reports. (The version of the American Health Care Act that passed in the House includes a provision that would slash funding for the organization.) They’ll appear on CBS This Morning as part of their special Mom campaign, encouraging their fans to donate to the organization. (Vanity Fair has reached out to Janney, her co-star Anna Faris, and Lorre for comment, and will update this post accordingly.) Although the move to forego campaigning is extremely rare, such decisions could become more mainstream over the next few years.

Yet a quick look at the playlist for Suicide Squad vs. Wonder Woman on the official Warner Bros. YouTube page is as different as night and day.   Approximately a month before Warner Bros. releases one of their biggest films of the year, one that will go down in entertainment history one way or another simply for being the first film starring Princess Diana, the company has released three trailers and two “Tilt Brush” videos explaining the concept art.  At the same point in the marketing cycle for Suicide Squad, the villainous flick already had three trailers, four TV spots, a “Buy Advanced Tickets” promotional video, and fun little biographies for each member of the team. That’s a hell of a lot more promotion for a B-string list of heroes (at best) than for WONDER WOMAN.

By Sunday night, dozens of strangers were messaging her that she is a criminal and a liar, and that they reported her to be deported. Sisa, 23, is a “dreamer” — her parents visited the U.S. from Argentina when she was 6 and overstayed their visas — but she is shielded from deportation by President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. DACA allows young undocumented immigrants without serious criminal records who were brought to the U.S. as children to register their personal information with the government, and in exchange receive federal work permits and a two-year reprieve from the threat of deportation, which allows them to get a Social Security number and a driver’s license. “I was hoping to kind of make a statement and educate people. What you’ve known all this time isn’t the truth,” Sisa said Monday morning. Speaking out for dreamers Sisa is an outspoken advocate for dreamers: In 2015 she wrote a popular opinion piece pressing Arizona leaders to grant in-state tuition to dreamers. Last year she served as a page at the Democratic National Convention, even though she can’t vote. “I decided to post it basically to bust the myth that immigrants don’t contribute and they don’t pay taxes to this country,” she said.  She said she filed state and federal taxes and, in the end, paid $300 to the state. She publicly posted a photo of herself holding a Form 1040 along with this caption: “MYTH BUSTER: I, an undocumented immigrant, just filed my taxes and PAID $300 to the state of Arizona. I cannot receive financial aid from the state or federal government for school, I cannot benefit from unemployment, a reduced healthcare plan, or a retirement fund. I think I’m a pretty good citizen. Oh and there are MILLIONS just like me who pay into a system they will never receive anything from. Wanna tell me again how I should be deported, contribute nothing and only leech off this country while the 1% wealthiest people in this country steal from you everyday? How about you show me yours Donald J. Trump? #HereToStay” […] More on immigration and taxes Although the issues of tax contributions and economic impact of immigrants without legal status are complicated, some non-partisan organizations have worked to analyze the matter. The 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States in 2013 collectively paid an estimated $11.64 billion a year in state and local taxes, including sales, property and personal-income taxes, according to a report last year from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. “The best evidence suggests that at least 50 percent of undocumented immigrant households currently file income tax returns using Individual Tax Identification Numbers (ITINs), and many who do not file income tax returns still have taxes deducted from their paychecks,” the study stated. Stephen Goss, the chief actuary of the Social Security Administration, told The Atlantic a similar number last year: He said undocumented immigrants paid $13 billion into Social Security in 2010, and only received about $1 billion in benefits.    Belén Sisa’s now-famous Facebook post on undocumented immigrants and taxes is right on the money. Her story also dispels the myth that undocumented immigrants don’t pay taxes in this nation.Also, they pay far more into taxes than they will ever receive from it.   " False link

As rape crisis centers, shelters, and other service providers who work each and every day to meet the needs of all survivors and reduce sexual assault and domestic violence throughout society, we speak from experience and expertise when we state that these claims are false. […]Transgender people already experience unconscionably high rates of sexual assault—and forcing them out of facilities consistent with the gender they live every day makes them vulnerable to assault.

Palumbo said the myth operates off of the “wrong assumption that we know who predators are and what they look like or what they behave like.

In an interview with Media Matters, she questioned the motives of those promoting bathroom bills in the name of women’s safety:Transgender people are not my boogeyman in the closet. My boogeyman in the closet is the man who is a rapist who has a position of power, that everyone thinks, because he has power or because he’s nice or because he’s white, … that ‘I’m safe from him.’ That is my biggest fear.“[…]If these same people were concerned about the safety of women, they would have come out against any number of issues that have come up about sexual violence over the years, but they have been remarkably silent.

Steve King (R-IA) on Thursday introduced the first federal “heartbeat bill” modeled on a failed Ohio attempt to end legal abortion as early as six weeks into a pregnancy—before many people know they’re pregnant.“Heartbeat bills” amount to total abortion bans. They have been declared unconstitutional in federal court.King’s office confirmed that HR 490 marked the first introduction of a so-called heartbeat bill in the U.S. Congress. Former Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-MN) introduced a forced ultrasound bill in 2011, but her measure did not ban abortion—King’s stated goal.A King press release called Roe v. Wade unconstitutional, adding that under HR 490, “if a heartbeat is detected, the baby is protected.”His spokesperson provided Rewire with legislative text specifying that an abortion provider “who knowingly performs an abortion and thereby kills a human fetus” without determining a heartbeat, informing the patient of a heartbeat, or proceeding regardless of a heartbeat would face fines and up to five years in prison. The bill includes limited exceptions for the physical health of the pregnant person but not for “psychological or emotional conditions.”King worked on the bill with anti-choice activist Janet Porter, the Faith2Action leader deemed too extreme for Christian talk radio, the congressman’s spokesperson said. Porter was behind Ohio Republicans’ recent failed attempt to push through a total abortion ban. Anti-choice Ohio Gov. John Kasich ® vetoed the measure the same day he signed a 20-week ban into law, reasoning that the 20-week ban would be more constitutionally prudent. It’s not.Porter persuaded King to act while both attended the funeral of Phyllis Schlafly, the notorious Equal Rights Amendment opponent, as People For the American Way’s Right Wing Watch first reported in October.[…]Total abortion bans are among the nation’s most extreme anti-choice measures, and the courts have generally agreed. North Dakota’s GOP-majority legislature enacted a total abortion ban in 2013 that was struck down in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The U.S. Supreme Court last year wouldn’t take up the case, letting the decision stand.The Eighth Circuit in 2014 blocked a similar Arkansas bill, the “Arkansas Heartbeat Protection Act,” which sought to ban abortion upon the detection of a fetal heartbeat—as early as six weeks’ gestation—and at 12 weeks, with narrow exceptions for the life of the pregnant person, cases of rape or incest, and those that involve a “lethal fetal disorder.” Both the Arkansas and North Dakota laws ultimately attempted to overturn Roe.  This is straight out of the Janet Porter-backed Faith2Action playbook that eventually led to #HB493’s veto in Ohio.  " False link

Matt Bevin ®, who is expected to sign it. The ban came less than a week after Republicans took control over all three branches of Kentucky government. Before the November election, Republicans had not controlled the Kentucky House since 1921. Anti-abortion advocates argue that fetuses can feel pain at 20 weeks, but that claim isn’t supported by medical evidence. Reproductive rights advocates worry that 20-week bans could be used as a vehicle to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark case that protects a woman’s right to have an abortion. Nearly 20 states have passed 20-week abortion bans. The Kentucky legislature also passed a separate bill Saturday that requires a woman to have an ultrasound before she receives an abortion. Bevin is also expected to sign that bill. ACLU-KY Advocacy Director Kate Miller called the ultrasound bill “nothing more than a state-mandated guilt trip designed to shame women seeking safe, legal abortions.”  Neither the 20-week abortion ban nor the ultrasound bill contains exceptions for cases of rape and incest. Both measures moved remarkably quickly through the Kentucky legislature, which opened its session on Tuesday. The laws contain emergency language that will make them effective immediately once they are signed, the Lexington Herald Leader reported earlier this week. The ACLU of Kentucky and Planned Parenthood have criticized how quickly the 20-week ban moved through the legislature. Demonstrators took to the state capitol building in Frankfort this week to protest the bill.  “Things are moving so quickly, members of the public and press were unable to obtain copies of the 20-week abortion ban and ultrasound bills before they received a reading and were headed to committee for a vote.” Lawmakers are also considering a different measure that would block state and local funds from going towards funding any organization that provides abortion services.

This is tantamount to calling the constituents they’re in office to represent stupid. Coverage about the bill is below the radar in all major news outlets.Breaking with precedent, the Senate has banned filming of hallway interviews with Senators.

Find numbers for your reps’ state offices here.  If you have Dem Senators you know will vote against it, encourage them to withhold consent or filibuster unless the bill is made public.

If you’re not on Facebook, tap that email list. No time to be shy–you’ve got friends out there who just need a little nudge/encouragement/empowerment.   3) WRITE a Letter to the Editor. Pen a message and send it to your local  paper. Media isn’t doing its job covering this incredibly important issue, leaving room for  citizens to step in.  4) SHOW UP. Be a body on the ground at your Senator’s district offices (find those offices here and find others to team up with here). Be  loud. Be quiet but present. Be whatever you are, but be in that space,  demanding accountability. Congress works for us.  5) Take to social media and demand the Senate #ShowUsTheBill … but don’t JUST take to social media; that won’t get ‘er done.  Call call call. I use my lunch hour every day.

(Last time we checked, $100,000 isn’t chicken feed to most folks.)Like any good “career politician” (his words, seriously), Mike Moon has gotten pretty cocky when it comes to introducing bills that have nothing to do with helping the people he represents and everything to do with pushing his extreme ideological agenda.He’s compared abortion to the Holocaust and slavery and wants to write those comparisons into law. In his worst offense, He proposed a bill that would have required the Missouri State Capitol to create an exhibit on abortion near its exhibit on slavery and gave it a name that references the Holocaust—the Never Again Act.He opposed a plan that would give state employees paid time off to take care of their children, comparing it to Marxist ideology, and he supported throwing refugees in internment camps instead of giving them a chance at a normal life in the land of opportunity.Listen: Whatever Mike Moon does with a chicken in the privacy of his own home is his business. But when anti-choice politicians like him tell women what kind of healthcare we can or cannot access and waste taxpayer money to pursue their own ideological agenda, we’re going to make some noise.That’s why we’re declaring him our newest Dirty, Rotten, Sexist Scoundrel and calling on our 1.2 million member-activists to cluck up a storm so he knows that his views are out of touch with the priorities of hardworking Missouri women and families."
