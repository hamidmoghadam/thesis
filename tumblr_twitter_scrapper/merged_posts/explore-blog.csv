Parts of me died early on, and that’s something we can all say one way or another. I got to redesign my life around this fact, and I tell you it has been a liberation to realize you can always find a shock of beauty or meaning in what life you have left, like that snowball lasting for a perfect moment, all the while melting away. If we love such moments ferociously, then maybe we can learn to live well – not in spite of death, but because of it. Let death be what takes us, not lack of imagination.

Our power to think spaciously and reflectively, to bring to mind and hold many ideas and facts, to attend to and maintain a steady focus, to make plans and put them into motion—these are all made possible by the frontal lobes.But the frontal lobes also exert an inhibiting or constraining influence on what Pavlov called “the blind force of the subcortex”—the urges and passions that might overwhelm us if left unchecked. (Apes and monkeys, like children, though clearly intelligent and capable of forethought and planning, are relatively lacking in frontal lobes, and tend to do the first thing that occurs to them, rather than pausing to reflect. Such impulsivity can be striking in patients with frontal-lobe damage.) There is normally a beautiful balance, a delicate mutuality, between the frontal lobes and the subcortical parts of the brain that mediate perception and feeling, and this allows a consciousness that is free-ranging, playful, and creative. The loss of this balance through frontal-lobe damage can “release” impulsive behaviors, obsessive ideas, and overwhelming feelings and compulsions. Were Spalding’s symptoms a result of frontal-lobe damage or severe depression, or a malignant coupling of the two?Sacks’s fully New Yorker essay is very, very much worth a read, and his autobiography triply so. " True text

Here are some of the highlights – a fine addition to this ongoing archive of celebrated writers’ advice on the craft.On not being creatively timid and holding oneself back from the fullness of one’s potential: Young novelists often will write a book which only takes a third or two thirds of what they know they can do. The real trick is to write novels which are vessels that contain everything that you can do and figure our and imagine.On the true measure of a successful book:A successful book for me is one not only that I get you to read all the way through to the end, but also is one in which there is no large discrepancy between what I want you to understand and what you understand. If you go away from my book … on your own … and think to yourself, “I’m making this book mean what it means to me,” and there’s a great discrepancy between these two things, then I’ve failed… I’m trying to authorize your response – that’s what it means to be an author. On why writers write (something also addressed, with great elegance and insight, by Mary Gaitskill, David Foster Wallace, Joan Didion, Michael Lewis, Charles Bukowski, Susan Orlean, and George Orwell):  F.R. Leavis said, “Literature is the supreme means by which you renew your sensuous and emotional life and learn a new awareness.” So I think there is a hunger for those things in the world, and it’s a kind of honorable vocation to try to serve to that hunger. So … I try to write books that would cause you to undergo a renewal of your sensuous and emotional life, and along the way provide some kind of new awareness. The entire conversation, which can be found on NYPL’s altogether excellent podcast feed, is well worth hearing.

Last week, I spent time scanning and restoring the images, then wrote about the edition with the appropriate background and context.   Three days later, Buzzfeed, the vermin on of the internet – or, for a more context-appropriate metaphor, the pigs of the internet – stripped the images of context and reposted them, without credit, as an ad-infested listicle nestled among their usual fare of ethically repugnant “sponsored content.”   If this seems like an extreme reaction, there’s something to be said for the blend of anguish and fury that comes with investing eight years of your life into a labor of love, only to see it systematically stolen by greedy thieves who feel they are more equal than others.   The most tragicomic irony? In my original piece, I also included an excerpt from, and a note on the timeliness of, Orwell’s unpublished preface to the book, in which he discusses the failures of integrity in journalism.  This is a rant, yes, but also a reminder – a reminder that our attention is a gift to be given thoughtfully, that we shape our own media universe, its ideals and its promises, through what we choose read and share.

B. White and James Thurber asked in 1929: Is sex necessary? Borrell writes:  Approximately two billion years ago a pair of single-celled organisms made a terrible mistake – they had sex. We’re still living with the consequences. Sexual reproduction is the preferred method for an overwhelming portion of the planet’s species, and yet from the standpoint of evolution it leaves much to be desired. Finding and wooing a prospective mate takes time and energy that could be better spent directly on one’s offspring. And having sex is not necessarily the best way for a species to attain Darwinian fitness. If the evolutionary goal of each individual is to get as many genes into the next generation as possible, it would be simpler and easier to just make a clone. The truth is, nobody really knows why people – and other animals, plants and fungi-prefer sex to, say, budding. Stephen C. Stearns, an evolutionary biologist at Yale University, says scientists now actively discuss more than 40 different theories on why sex is so popular. Each has its shortcomings, but the current front-runner seems to be the Red Queen hypothesis. It gets its name from a race in Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking Glass. Just as Alice has to keep running to stay in the same place, organisms have to keep changing their genetic makeup to stay one step ahead of parasites. Sexual reproduction allows them to shuffle their genetic deck with each generation. That’s not to say that sex is forever. When it comes to reproduction, evolution is a two-way street. When resources and mates are scarce, almost all types of animals have been known to revert to reproducing asexually.  And yet, humans seem to expend an awful lot of energy thinking about sex and trying to legislate it." True text

I was tragically late in getting back to him and missed the deadline – my answer remains that a great journalist should frame for the reader what matters in the world and why, and do it with equal parts integrity and conviction – but, fortunately, Brendan forged ahead and collected answers from some of today’s top journalists. My favorite comes – perhaps unsurprisingly – from NPR’s ever-wise Robert Krulwich:  The audience is very present, very noisy, often churlish, but sometimes graciously nice; if I want I can spy on them as they tweet my name. (Which, alas, I do. I am a total loser and should be ashamed.) All this back and forthing has, I think, made me a touch more cautious, which is not a bad thing, a lot more anxious, and maybe a bit too aware of how many people are tuning in or tuning out. What I have to do is I have to sort through what the “demanders” demand—“How dare you…!” “What about…?” “I will never read your stupid…etc.” —from the ones who simply want to ask a new question, want to muse, want to share. I guess we need both, but I would be lying if I said I think the “demanders” are a delight. They aren’t. They’re rude, intemperate, but in an open system, you can’t live without them, so you learn to live with them. […] So—to answer your question, what should a consumer demand of a reporter? If you can lower your voice a little, what you should demand is a story that finds you. Not a story that sits in its place and says, “Read me. I’m here. You should know this,” but a story that steps out and pokes you in a sensitive place, calls you to it, holds you and doesn’t let you go until it, the story, is done. You should demand to be taken captive. But demand it gently.  Complement with Krulwich’s timeless commencement address on the era of friends in low places." True text

Lerner’s alter ego is obsessed with the ‘incommensurability of language and experience’ and our detachment from our own emotions. The question the book asks: Do we have a way out? Maggie Nelson’s Bluets is a brief meditation on the color blue, a cri de coeur about Nelson’s inability to get over the end of a love affair, and a grievous contemplation of a close friend’s paralysis. The book keeps getting larger and larger until it winds up being about nothing less than the melancholy of the human animal: Why are we so sad? How do we deal with loss, how do we deal with the ultimate loss? It’s impressively adult—wrestling with existence at the most fundamental level—in a way that I find very few books are. Amy Fusselman’s The Pharmacist’s Mate fluctuates wildly and unpredictably from Fusselman’s attempt to get pregnant through artificial means to her conversations with her dying father to his World War II diary entries. I don’t know what the next paragraph will be, where Fusselman is going, until—in the final few paragraphs—she lands on the gossamer-thin difference between life and death, which is where she’s been focused all along, if I could only have seen it. In Out of Sheer Rage, Geoff Dyer tries and fails to write a biography of D.H. Lawrence, but the book conveys Lawrence better than any conventional biography does, and more important, it asks the following question: How and why do we get up in the morning? In many ways it’s a thinking person’s self-help book: how to live your life with passion when you know every passion is delusional. Dyer’s conclusion: 'The best we can do is to try to make some progress with our studies of D.H. Lawrence’; by getting up in the morning, we get up in the morning—and by not writing our biographies of D.H. Lawrence, we write our biographies of D.H. Lawrence. In Simon Gray’s The Smoking Diaries, a man, whose friends are dying and who by the final book of this four-volume work is dying himself, stands before us utterly naked and takes account: Rembrandt’s late self-portraits, in prose. The gravitation is very extreme to always make himself look bad, and in so doing, of course, he renders himself lovable. An entire life, an entire way of thinking, comes into being; having read the diaries, I feel less lonely. J.M. Coetzee’s Elizabeth Costello eviscerates, chapter by chapter, a commitment (antiapartheid activism, animal rights, friendship, art, love, sex) that Coetzee, in previous books, had once affirmed. The 'novel’ consists almost entirely of a series of lectures that Coetzee actually gave, but in the book it’s a fictional character named Elizabeth Costello who gives the lectures. Coetzee/Costello is trying to find something that he/she can actually believe, and by the end of the book the only thing Coetzee can affirm, the only thing Costello affirms, is the belling of the sound of frogs in mud: the animal life of sheer survival; I love how joyous and despairing that is—it’s on the side of life but along a very narrow ledge. Sarah Manguso’s The Guardians goes to hell and back, just barely back, and ends with a tiny glimmer of uptick– not too much but not too little, either. It’s the only affirmation that anyone can offer: Astonishingly, we’re here. David Markson’s This Is Not a Novel is a sustained meditation on a single question: Against death, what consolation, if any, is art? Markson constantly toggles back and forth between celebrating the timelessness of art and mocking such grandiosity, and the book forces me to ask myself, What do I push back with? Maybe art, and if so, barely.  Complement with celebrated writers’ favorite books and the greatest books of all time as voted by 125 famous authors." True text

Here are the highlights. On not planning or writing ahead of time, instead letting the story unfold organically – the same faith in emotional intuition over intellectualization that Ray Bradbury famously championed:  I try to allow the feedback loop of staring at a blank page with few distractions other than my own memories, disappointments and yearnings direct a story and set a tone. … I keep vague notes but fundamentally I believe it’s very important for a story to find its own structure rather than the other way around… [That is] the only way to find the “shape of life” in an honest, awkward way that feels and hopefully is human. Our minds are already very organized things; the trick, I think, is simply to trust them.  On why emotional excess is essential to creativity:  The truth is that life is sad, for lack of a better word, but it’s also something else: a sensation we rarely feel because as adults we spend most of out time and effort trying to figure out how to dull and tamp down: it’s sort of a combination of tenderness, empathy, vulnerability and anger. We probably feel this most intensely as children and especially as adolescents, but the sensation is still always there humming underneath everything, and in moments of extreme emotion comes to the fore; these are the times as adults when we feel “life” most deeply.  On the storytelling power of the comic form:  I’ve sort of tried writing “words only” but the experience is always like skating on oiled glass; I never know where I am, and I can’t figure out how to stop sliding. There’s something unique and strange about writing with images which compels me to continue. Besides, Nabokov himself noted we thought not only in words, but also in pictures. I like the dumb, flat disposability of comics; they allow for a more direct experience with a reader, if not an admittedly uneconomical one, work-to-reading-time-wise. But that’s my problem, not the reader’s.  On some of his influences:  Tolstoy, Joyce, Chekhov, Updike, Zadie Smith, Nabokov, Alice Munro, David Foster Wallace, Dave Eggers, Cheever, Dostoevsky, George Saunders, Flannery O'Connor, Willa Cather…  On something all too many aspiring creators forget: the sheer doggedness, unrelenting dedication, and character-testing perseverance in the face of rejection that success requires:  I try to be as honest as I possibly can with anyone who puts themselves through the rigamarole of trying to do this stuff. I was miserable myself for years and I know it’s no fun to learn how to do and there’s very little to encourage one for the solitude and doubt it can engender.  On not getting boggled down in the “ideal reader” and being driven by the genuine desire to kindle kindness:  I try not to think of the reader at all beyond trying to make something that’s clear and readable; I have no one type or person in mind … I hope to affect the reader … on an empathetic level. It sounds very sappy and dumb but really, if it’s possible to encourage a little bit of kindness then I guess I’d be thrilled to think I might’ve somehow done so.  On prose vs. comics:  One almost goes blind while reading prose; reading comics keeps the eyes sort of half-open.  On the singular allure of drawing as a mental faculty:  There’s a history of appreciating drawing in Japanese art especially that necessary to comics’ functioning — the reading of images, rather than just the looking at them – that western art seems to have had a real hang up over for, like, centuries. Drawing, to me, reflects the way we think, remember and even see sometimes more than painting or photography.  On how his mother, whose words of wisdom seem to belong amidst history’s greatest motherly advice, shaped his worldview:  My mother definitely gave me the first encouragement to become an artist, from praising my earliest drawings to signing me up for art classes to encouraging me to go to art school to telling me that she didn’t care what I did with my life as long as I tried to be “the best at it I possibly could,’ with the addendum that one should always try to leave a place in a better state than it was when you got there (i.e. the world.) Not that I’m exactly doing that, but they’re good words to live by, I think.  On the power of infographic storytelling:  I worked a little while on my undergraduate student newspaper as the graphic designer and had to make info-graphics about local news events, and from that experience I started to see the potential of using such devices to communicate something about relationships between characters and places in my stories; diagrams have a sense of ""verb tense” to them that seems almost transcendental, for lack of a less pretentious word  On the history of the comic form and how Art Spiegelman and R. Crumb ushered in a second-wave revolution:  I truly believe the comics form sort of froze esthetically in the 1930s/1940s when it began imitating the conceits of moviemaking; before that, newspaper comics especially were wildly inventive, strange and experimental. It wasn’t until the 1960s and the so-called undergrounds with artists like Crumb, Spiegelman, Justin Green and Kim Deitch that things really started to get going again.  On his daily routine, dictated by being a great dad:  My workday is entirely predicated on the Oak Park school system; i.e. once I get my daughter to school I sit down and try to concentrate as diligently as I can with as few distractions as possible, a situation which the internet does not exactly foment. (I turn off the computer most of the time for this reason.) Once my daughter is home from school we might plan or spend time together before picking up my wife from work (she’s a high school teacher) and then the evening is generally spent getting or going to dinner. I might be able to work again once everyone’s in bed, but frequently I just read. I’m very grateful for this life, and never expected in a million years I’d be so lucky.  Read the full Q&A here. This Design Matters interview with Ware, however, remains his best." True text

Hence, two takes on the same Pew report on the impact of digital tools on learning. In an article titled “The Internet Is Making Writing Worse,” The Atlantic Wire proclaims:  Bad news for teens and tweens! A new Pew Research survey of teachers around the country found that today’s digital technologies like the internet, texting and social networks make middle school and high school students likely to perform a number of academic atrocities, including using informal language in formal papers and plagiarizing.   Meanwhile, The Independent declares that “Facebook, Twitter and blogging actually improve students’ work according to survey.” The real findings, of course, were too mixed and nuanced to allow for a catchy headline: The majority of teachers reported that digital tools “allow students to share their work with a wider and more varied audience,” enhance collaboration, and empower creativity and self-expression; but they also worried that such tools are blurring the line between ""formal” and “informal” writing, prioritizing short-form writing, and incentivizing shortcuts and plagiarism. Whatever happened to the art of communicating nuance and not forcing ambiguity into a concrete answer? Simone de Beauvoir made an art of ambiguity, John Keats famously advocated for the importance of “negative capability” – that crucial willingness to embrace the unanswered without discomfort – and Richard Feynman argued that leaving room for doubt is essential for the progress of science.

And I was evasive about that, because I didn’t want to tell him that it ain’t gonna happen. But the day of the entrance exam — they occurred on the same day — I took the entrance examination to the High School of Music and Art. And the next day I came into school, he was in the hallway as I was walking down, and he said, “I want to talk to you.” I said, “Uh-oh — the jig is up, he’s going to find out I took the ‘wrong’ exam.” He said, “Come to my office… Sit down.” And, as I was sitting there, he said, “I hear you took the exam for Music and Art.” And I said, “Um, yes.” And then he reached over, and he reached into his desk, and he pulled out a box of French Conté crayons — a fancy, expensive box — and he gave it to me, and he said, “Do good work.” I can’t tell that story without crying, because it was such a profound example of somebody — an adult, authority figure, sophisticated man — who was willing to put aside his own desire for something, his own direction for my life, and recognize me as a person who had made a decision. And he was, instead of simply acknowledging it, encouraging it with this incredibly gracious and generous gift. … The thing about it that always astonishes you is that moment — it couldn’t have taken more than two minutes — was totally transformative about my view of life, my view of others, my view of education, my view of acknowledging the other.  Send this to every educator or mentor you know, and think of what would be possible if we were all capable of such self-transcendence for the sake of elevating another’s potential.  Watch the interview, superb in its entirety, here."

Putin has declared war on the gay community. He’s made it illegal to promote homosexuality in theater, film, tv, print that in any way could be seen by youth. In other words anything gay is now pornography.He’s outlawed the adopting of Russian children to any country that has legalized marriage equality.And now it is reported that his next law will remove the children of GLBT families from their homes. This will apply to biological children as well as formerly adopted ones.This is a horror. Not only for our community but even for straight families. Already divorced parents are threatening one another with blackmail to tell authorities that their ex is now gay just to control parental rights.Putin wants this attack against human rights to be his legacy. He believes he can get the backing of the Vatican as well as all other conservative religious leaders to join his cause. What can we do? Make his actions and his plans public. Shine the light of public opinion on this evil doer.Boycott the Winter Olympics in Russia. Believe me, Putin will use the Olympics as proof that the world backs up his action. There are only two ways to deal with a tyrant: Starve out the rat, or destroy him. So, my friends, do your research and then GET LOUD AGAINST PUTIN AND HIS ANTI-GAY POGROM. This is a very small world. Our brothers and sisters in Russia need us NOW!  Important and increasingly hard to ignore. Putin’s “anti-gay propaganda law” is drawing outrage across Europe and elsewhere. " False link

At the time, “lad culture” ran throughout British music and television, and wazzock, a North-England accented contraction of the sarcastic wiseacre (a know-it-all) became a powerful tool to shoot people down in an argument.  LUMMOX Though the etymology of lummox is heavily disputed, one thing is for certain: It came from East Anglia, the coastal outcrop of Britain above London. There, around 1825, someone threw out the word as an insult, and it stuck, becoming a typically British go-to term. Some linguists believe it comes from the verb lummock, which typified a lummox: it means a clumsy oaf.  SKIVER Skivers and shirkers are one and the same. Someone who manages to duck under any responsibility and loaf around, doing very little, is a skiver. The origins of this particular insult are contested: some think it’s from an Old Norse word—skifa—meaning “slice,” whereby the worker slices off as much work as possible.  MINGER Often hurled at the opposite sex, to call someone a minger is to say they are objectively unattractive. Though etymologists struggle to agree where the word came from, it seems likely that it stems from the Old Scots word meng, meaning “sh**.” We didn’t say it was pretty.  NINCOMPOOP For such a colloquial word, nincompoop actually has a very learned past. Samuel Johnson, the compiler of England’s first proper dictionary, claims the word comes from the Latin phrase non compos mentis (“not of right mind”), and was originally a legal term.  PILLOCK As words are used more regularly, the laziness of pronunciation can often warp them slightly. So it was with pillock. Originally pillicock (a Norwegian slang word for penis), the word has since been condensed to plain old pillock—though its meaning remains.  CLOD HOPPER According to the brilliant Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue, dating back to 1811 and compiled by Captain Francis Grose, a clod hopper refers to a country farmer or ploughman—with the implication nowadays that you’re slow witted and bumbling.  DUNAKER Grose’s Dictionary of vulgarities is a rich seam of overlooked insults. In the 200 years since it was published, there have been several terms that have fallen out of favor. One of them is dunaker, a common thief of cows and calves.  GIT By calling someone a git, you’re invoking the old Scots word get, which means “bastard.” When it came down south of the border, it lost its harsh vowel sound and became something softer, albeit with the required spikiness in.
