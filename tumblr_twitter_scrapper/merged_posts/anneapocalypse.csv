It takes time for anyone to learn and improve. But there are some shortcuts you can try, maybe adapt to your own needs. Here are 11 writing problems and their solutions, or hacks. Too many ideas syndrome Problem: You have too many equally good story ideas and can’t pick just one to write. Solution: Select your top 3 favorite stories and write the first scene of all three. If you can’t decide, write the first chapter. The right project will be easier to work with, you’ll have fun writing it, you will be daydreaming about the story, you will love the characters. So, give away three chances instead of one.  Outline spoiling the fun Problem: Whenever you outline a story idea, it completely spoils your will to write it. The mystery is gone. Solution: Instead of outlining the whole story, just make a clear goal on how your characters should end. Will they succeed? Will they fail? Will they be happy? Will they find redemption? Will they be wronged? Decide how your story should end and explore the plot as you go. Remember, no one will read your first draft, so just write. Lost midway Problem: If you are a pantser, you might get lost in the middle of the story, especially after the first plot point.   Solution: Give your story an ending. If you know where your characters will end up, you’ll have a better understanding of which routes to take. Always keep in mind how the story will end. Use it as the beacon of a lighthouse to guide you through stormy waters. Creative block Problem: You don’t have story ideas. Or nothing you have so far excites you enough for a novel. Solution: Read a book or watch a movie completely out of your genre. This works like magic, I promise. I’m not a sci-fi person, but Akira has given me more story ideas than any movie and book from my own genre.  Writing anxiety Problem: You are scared of writing, scared of starting a new story, or just scared of not doing a good job. Solution: Write a fanfic. No one expects a fanfic to be a masterpiece (although many are). Fanfics are done for fun and for passion. So, write your book in fanfic format. You can even use fandom characters and aus in the process. When the story is completed, change back to original characters. Editing as you write Problem: You keep going back to previous paragraphs and editing instead of moving forward with your writing.   Solution: Write your novel by hand. This might sound like a lot of work, but it’s quite the opposite. The white screen of the computer urges you to review, to make it perfect, academic like perfect. The paper however, brings you back to the craft, to the urge of filling lines and pages. Handwriting also gives you the opportunity of sketching and doodling.  Procrastination Problem: Tumblr. Youtube. Email. Netflix. Bathroom. Fridge. Bed. Solution: Go offline. Turn off your wi-fi. Use a device without internet connection. Or, if you keep fooling yourself and turning the internet back on, write your novel by hand. Give yourself a daily hour of internet, but live offline. And if you take unnecessary trips to the fridge or the bathroom, try the pomodoro technique.  Lack of plots Problem: Nothing relevant is happening, your story looks kind of boring. Or the main plot is too weak for a whole novel. Solution: Take a few days off. Just relax. When you are ready to go back, read what you have written so far. Maybe you were just tired. But, if the story really sucks, go back to basics. Ask yourself two questions. What type of story am I writing? How will this story end? Follow the answer like a map. Change what needs to be changed, even if you have to delete the whole progress. If you lack plots, don’t add fillers, just go back to basics.    Weak main character Problem: Your character lacks personality, voice and/or visuals. Solution: Give your main character three things. An external battle. An internal battle. And an unique feature. The external battle is their goal, what they want to achieve, what they dream about. An internal battle is their fears, traumas, doubts, mental issues, prejudices and triggers to overcome. An unique feature is what sets them apart from other characters, maybe they have piercings, or tattoos, or pink hair, or lilac eyes, maybe they wear neon boots, or a mask, or mittens, maybe they are left-handed, or blind, maybe they have a scar, or a birthmark. Every amazing main character has external battles, internal battles and unique features.    Depression Problem: You have no will to write. The passion is gone. You feel empty.   Solution: If you don’t have access to medical help, reading is a good way to reevaluate your career and regain your passion for the words. Read lots of books. Don’t worry about writing, just read. Lose yourself in fictional adventures. Read sci-fi, romance, horror, fantasy, crime, family saga, classics, foreigner fictions, fanfics, shorts, poetry. Immerse in literature. Literature can save lives.    Strange dialogues Problem: Dialogues seem too formal, or too much like the narration, or characters lack individuality. Solution: Read your dialogues out loud while acting as your characters. You can find a quiet empty room for that. Be an actor. Go for the emotions. Record your acting sections, after all, you might improvise at some point.      " False text

Some of these were even created by AO3 coders when not working on Archive code. \o/ However, please keep in mind that we can’t provide technical support for any of these unofficial tools. If something stops working, pls contact the creator who can look into a fix. Here’s a few of the newest additions and classic add-ons: If you use Google Drive to work on fics, fannish meta, or other text-based fanworks, you might have run into formatting issues when copying from Google Drive to our Rich Text Editor. In particular, italics and bold text will not be carried over correctly when copy-pasting the text. To solve this problem, OTW Translation volunteer Min has created a script for Google Drive that will take your finished work and convert all basic formatting into HTML for you. You can see it in action in this example document for posting to the AO3. Look for the “Make a copy…” option in the File menu, which will put a private copy of the document into your own Google Drive account. Then just delete the sample text and use the blank document for your own writing. When you’re done, hit the “Post to AO3” menu to prepare the whole thing for pasting into the HTML editor with a simple button click. HTML tags will be added for you! In most cases, this will be much more reliable than using the Rich Text Editor. To view all Movie fandoms or any other of our fandom listings sorted by number of works instead of alphabetically, use this Reorder Fandoms bookmarklet by carene waterman. Front end coder tuff_ghost cloned the popular Tumblr Savior script for use on the Archive: AO3 Savior lets you define creators, tags, or summary keywords and will hide all work blurbs that contain one or more of these terms. Check out adevyish’s AO3 Lazier userscript which adds a Latest Chapter button next to the chapter dropdown. The AO3 Statistics CSV Bookmarklet by Flamebyrd lets you download your AO3 work stats (number of hits, kudos, bookmarks etc.) as a .csv file, which can be neatly imported into a spreadsheet for your own number-crunching.
