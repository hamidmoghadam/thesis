Steals their aspect from enemies  to empower themselves. Buffer/debuffer.  Steals the enemy’s attack  power to buff her own. Doing so also makes the enemy smaller and more  frail, while making the Thief bigger and tougher. However, the more  power absorbed by the Thief, the less control over herself she has and  may go on a killing spree." True text

I spent all my money to attend this Cal Arts summer program, literally all of it. So I have no money at all for food and the essentials of life. How am I going to survive is beyond me, all I have is hope now. So I made one of these. Hopefully it helps. " True link
