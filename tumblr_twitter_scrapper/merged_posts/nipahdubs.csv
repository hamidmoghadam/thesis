You may feel like your parents are giving you the “weird eye” and being generally unsupportive. If that’s the case, you might want to have a talk with them:  Let them know what this is Parents (or friends) may see cosplay as a childish activity that involves making Halloween a year-round event. You can help make them understand cosplay is more than that. Cosplay can be casual, it can be competitive, it can be fun, but it can also be serious. Regardless, cosplayers are passionate doing what they do and helping your parents see your passion will go a long way.  You may also want to introduce them to the fandom that you’re cosplaying from. I know that my sister and I spent a while explaining the oddities of anime when we were starting on our first cosplays (e.g. yes, I know he’s got bright blonde hair and wears a neon-orange jumpsuit, but I swear he’s a ninja….)  Explain the benefits of cosplay Whether you are buying or making your cosplay, it forces you to use skills that will be useful in real life: working a budget, time management, negotiating/bargaining (if doing commissions), setting goals, and delivering results by a certain deadline.   Think of all the useless things you could be doing with your time rather than cosplaying: texting/tweeting, mindlessly surfing the Internet, lazing around the house etc.  Cosplay has a thriving community with many friendly people - there are thousands of chances to meet new people, both online and in real life. Emphasize the networking possibilities.  Make it clear that you have your priorities straight Parents may be worried that you’ll go for cosplay over studying, chores, work etc. This cannot be the case - real world responsibilities come first. Let you parents know this and then follow through! I cannot stress enough that you need to prioritize smartly. Get them involved You might be surprised at how interested they get - also, you never know what tricks they have up their sleeves. For example, my dad loves taking photos, so now I go to him whenever I want some high-quality basic shots of my costumes.  " False text

Though they had one of the hardest tasks of all, taking iconic characters everyone knows and bringing them to life in a way that is modern is already a task in itself.Joker and Harleys redesigns were the most iconic pop culture costumes of 2016, they were EVERYWHERE, their outfits were plastered wherever they could be including their wigs and makeup (there are literally hundreds of makeup tutorials for them on youtube). Everyone dressed up as them and there are thousands and thousands of people who have cosplayed them. Even more so, the designs were so popular they’re now in the comics/video games. I personally don’t like the designs but I can acknowledge how insanely popular they became and still are. Enchantress had a rather unique redesign as well.Jokers makeup was literally one of the most talked about things last year when they first uploaded that first picture, whether you hated it or loved it it was still being talked about and the press around it was insane.Killer Croc and Enchantresses minions had wonderful prosthetic work as well and the tattoo applications, while simple, are another thing to look at.Star Trek had phenomenal prosthetic work for their aliens but it isn’t something the general public are gonna remember/see really after a few months. What you are gonna keep seeing for years to come is people cosplaying the designs from Suicide Squad. It earned its Oscar for being one the biggest Pop culture hits on makeup and hair design alone.

Recently, I have taken in a homeless art student that attends college with my youngest son. Unfortunately, certain circumstances prevent him from going to school for a second year. Born and raised in America, Kevin struggled to live in a household governed by parents of Chinese heritage. His parents are very traditional. They prevented him from an independent lifestyle until freshman year of college where he dormed with other young college students. Upon returning home for the summer, he asked his parents if he could live off campus and share an apartment with my son and several others. The costs of living there were cheaper than if he chose to live on-campus, but even so, his parents did not allow that. They warned him that if he decided to move out, then he would no longer receive support from them. They kicked him out of their home shortly after. Kevin sought help from his friends. He stayed with a local college friend, her mother, and her sister for a few days. Then he spent another week living in a homeless shelter in Atlanta, GA. Unable to find a job or secure a permanent residence, he returned home to live with his parents. Needless to say, he did not feel safe there and continued searching for another place to stay. I couldn’t bare this kid living on the streets, so my husband and I drove from our country (nice word for double wide) home to Atlanta and brought him over to live with us for the summer.I didn’t realize the extent of Kevin’s issues at home until getting to know him better. He suffered from depression, emotional abuse, and verbal threats under the control of his parents. He mentioned having suicidal thoughts in the past. Unfortunately, depression and mental illnesses are very foreign to his parents, and they insist in knowing what’s best for him and his future. They said he cannot go to school and worry about his mental health and well-being. Kevin chose his mental health and safety over the opportunity to go to college. We would like to help him continue following his aspirations. However, we are struggling to pay for our son’s college and cannot help Kevin without going into massive debt. His scholarships aren’t enough to cover his tuition, and he will lose those scholarships if he does not enroll full time. We don’t want him to face an even bigger burden. I am asking for whatever you can spare to help Kevin to fulfill his dreams.  " True link

Please help save my mom.  I have never done this sort of thing before. But, I need to do something. My mom, she means the world to me and I can’t lose her without trying all my options first. That’s why I decided to launch this campaign. I love my mom too much to not do something. She is the only one person in my life, who hasn’t treated me like an inconvenience. Through thick and thin, she has always been by my side, supporting me and loving me unconditionally. A few years ago, I came out about being bisexual and despite everything she was raised to believe she never made me feel ashamed about it. Instead, she hugged me and told me she loved me regardless and that nothing would ever change that. That’s just the sort of person she has always been; understanding and caring. So, I beg you. Please help me save my mom. Without her, I really don’t know what I would do. She is my rock, my best friend, my mom. Thank you for all the support.  HEY FOLLOWERS. If you have any money at all to spare, please consider donating a few bucks to help one of my best friends!!! Karen has had such a hard life surviving through the SHITTIEST situations imaginable. She does not need to lose her only support. Please help her save her mom. Even if it’s just a signal boost, I’m actually begging you.  Please share.   I personally know what it is to have to the chance to save your mother and not being able to because of money [she died about 8 years ago because we didn’t have enough money to take her to a clinic when she had complications with leukemia]. I was about to buy me a tablet, but wth. As soon as i get my credit back, i’m supporting this. And i invite to any person who read this to do so. It’s worth it.  I’m so sorry for your loss… My heart truly goes out to you and your family. And thank you. I truly appreciate everything you and everyone is doing; from sharing to donating, all of it. If there is anything I can ever do to repay your kindness just let me know.  Imagine yourself in this situation, and imagine yourself in her shoes. Please contribute as much as you could   Followers!
