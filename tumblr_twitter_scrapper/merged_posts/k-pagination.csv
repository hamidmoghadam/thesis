Allowing single people to have the autonomy to decide whether to marry and whom to marry, the Taiwanese court said in a news release, “is vital to the sound development of personality and safeguarding of human dignity, and therefore is a fundamental right.” The court also said that when same-sex couples create “a permanent union of intimate and exclusive nature for the committed purpose of managing a life together,” they’re not affecting the rights of people in a heterosexual marriage.  This doesn’t mean marriage equality is automatically and immediately enacted into law, though. Here are the next steps:  Taiwan’s president has asked the Ministry of Justice to come up with a legal framework for complying with the decision. The court’s ruling gives Taiwan’s government two years to change its marriage laws. If that deadline passes without legislative action, same-sex couples will be allowed to register for marriage and obtain “the status of a legally recognized couple.”  Incredible news.

The  President’s proposal would deprive countless Americans with disabilities  of critical health care and community-based supports. It would jeopardize our very lives and result in a massive return to nursing homes and institutions.  ASAN calls on Congress to reject these devastating cuts and craft a  budget that invests in people with disabilities, our families, and our  communities. We have come too far to go back. The President’s budget would require  massive cuts to Medicaid, which acts as a lifeline for countless people  with disabilities. Medicaid is not only a critical source of health care  coverage but also the main funder for home and community-based services  and supports that help us live in the community instead of  institutions. But the President’s budget takes the $800 billion in  Medicare cuts proposed by the American Health Care Act and adds an extra $610 billion in additional cuts. This will reduce Medicaid funding by more than a trillion dollars over the next 10 years – a change that would cut the program in half.   This budget would eliminate $47 million for research on health care and services for autistic people and our families  that was provided via the Autism CARES Act. These services include the  Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental and Other Related  Disabilities (LEND) and Developmental Behavioral Pediatrics (DBP)  programs which train healthcare professionals to work with autistic  people. These cuts are in addition to $5.8 billion in cuts to the  National Institutes of Health and $35 million in cuts to CDC work  related to autism and developmental disability. The budget would also cut Social Security at the same time that it cuts programs that help us find jobs in the community. It promises $50 billion in cuts to Social Security Disability.  The only way to achieve such stark cuts is to kick people with  disabilities off the program, through punitive and impossible-to-meet  work requirements or other harsh changes which will result in people  losing their Social Security. While ASAN has always supported programs  to help people with disabilities find employment, these cuts aren’t  designed to move people to quality jobs that help them escape poverty.  In fact, the budget would also cut all Vocational Rehabilitation funding for state supported employment grants,  which are instrumental in helping people with intellectual and  developmental disabilities get and keep real jobs in the community. Furthermore, it would punish SSI recipients for living together  – including couples and families – by reducing their SSI payments. SSI  programs already force people with disabilities to survive on an average  of just $18 per day. Further cuts would force SSI recipients to choose between separation and starvation. To  make it worse, the President’s budget would also make massive cuts to  programs that are critical to people with disabilities living in  poverty, including a $193 billion cut to the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), or food stamps program, over the next ten years; completely eliminating the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) that helps low-income people pay their heating bills; and a $72 million cut to substance abuse prevention programs. In addition to cuts to our health care and community-based services, our community would see a $25 million cut to programs to build affordable community-based housing for people with disabilities  and a $7.7 billion cut to affordable housing programs overall. These  cuts could cause over 250,000 people to lose the housing vouchers. The  budget would eliminate the National Housing Trust Fund, which helps people with extremely low incomes escape or avoid homelessness. For  thousands of people with disabilities who are already struggling to  make ends meet, these cuts will mean homelessness or imprisonment in an  institution. Finally, this budget would cut  smaller but vital programs that increase inclusion and independence for  people with disabilities and our families. This budget would cut all federal funding for the Special Olympics, would eliminate programs that provide free legal assistance to people with low incomes,  and would sharply reduce funding for State Councils on Developmental  Disabilities, the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living,  and Rehabilitation Research, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health  Services Administration.  People with disabilities’ lives have value and  are worth investing in. We deserve more than this. When Congress threatened to cut Medicaid by over $800 billion, we showed up to fight.  Congress heard from the disability community in town halls, and through  countless phone calls, faxes, and letters. That fight isn’t over–but we  can win, and we can beat these cuts too.  We call on Congress to reject the President’s attack on the supports we  need to live in the community. Our lives are too important to be put on  the chopping block. " False link

Dozens of men are in hiding.  Here’s part of the story you may not have heard: The Russian LGBT Network, an advocacy group that’s been helping Chechens escape, has been in touch with the U.S. embassy about securing visas for people trying to flee. While the U.S. hasn’t outright denied anyone yet, it has said in as many words that it will not be providing visas to Chechens trying to get out.  “We were informed there was no political will,” said the spokesperson, who asked her name be withheld because of security concerns. “They’re not going to provide visas. They’re going to support us in other ways, but not with visas.” […] A US State Department spokesperson said on background that all visa applications are considered on a case-by-case basis and the Chechens are eligible to apply. But US law does not have a visa category that allows someone to come directly to the US because of threats in their home country. Unless their situation fell into an unrelated category — like if they had a job offer in the US or were being reunited with a family member — they would only be eligible for tourist visas that would require them to prove they would return to Russia. “Nonimmigrant visa classifications and qualifications are set by U.S. law, as passed by Congress,” the spokesperson said. “There is no visa classification designated specifically for humanitarian relief.” […] The Chechens are not eligible to apply to come to the US as refugees because they are still inside their native country — someone fleeing persecution generally can only be considered a refugee once they’ve left their country of origin. A Russia LGBT Network official said US diplomats recommended Chechens try applying to the US after leaving Russia, but he worried that this could jeopardize their ability to ultimately reach a safe country legally if that route failed. There is also a risk they could be returned to Russia on trumped up charges. Many of the foreign fighters who have joined groups like ISIS have come from Chechnya, leading to concerns about Chechen asylum seekers. “They need refuge,” he said. “Not once did officials offer any specific solutions.”  Officials say they’re still looking for other ways that Chechens could come to the United States safely:  The Council for Global Equality, which advocates for LGBT rights in US foreign policy, said in a statement to BuzzFeed News that the organization was still hopeful an avenue could be found for the Chechens to come to the US despite the fact that the “Russian LGBT Network has been discouraged by their interactions with U.S. officials.” “We believe there are still options available in extreme cases like this and we are in contact with Russian LGBT activists and US government officials to continue to explore those options,” the statement said. “We hope there is political will on the Hill and within the Administration to provide a safe haven in the United States for carefully vetted claims. As advocates, it’s our job to try to make that case here in Washington.”  Is this the “great again” America we were promised, Mr. President? Is this what greatness looks like to you? " False link

Gov. Brian Sandoval signed Senate Bill 201 into law on Wednesday, joining New Mexico, California, Vermont, Oregon, New Jersey, New York and Illinois (plus D.C.). One big caveat, though, is that the bill includes a religious exemption that allows conversion-esque counseling by clergy members. So while the bill bans health professionals from trying to change a minor’s sexual orientation or gender identity, technically a religious official still can.  “Conversion therapy has been disavowed by medical experts and is considered a non-effective method of treatment that can cause harm to an adolescent,” Sandoval said after signing the bill Wednesday. ""This law will help protect some of our state’s most vulnerable youth.“ The bill was amended to exempt religious organizations and allow counseling by members of the clergy. Religious groups and conservatives insist that such a ban would infringe on their rights to religious freedom. “Banning conversion therapy makes Nevada a safer place for children who are at a higher risk for anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and even suicide,” bill sponsor Sen. David Parks of Las Vegas Parks said in a statement, reported by The Las Vegas Review-Journal. ""This bill is a major step forward in building a more equal and inclusive state.“  This is a good step overall, but I’m really disappointed in the religious exemption. Abuse is abuse, whether it takes place in a doctor’s office or a place of worship. The work continues.  " False link

The current threshold to bring in spouses (£18,600) has been blamed for inflicting a harsh choice of separation or living in exile on British families.   In 2015, it was estimated that the £18,600 threshold excludes 41 per cent of the British working population from bringing a foreign spouse to live in Britain.   The threshold rises to £22,400 if there is one or more non-European-born child in the family. The income of the non-European partner does not count towards the threshold.  VOTE THE TORIES OUT!

Our national monuments are part of the national parks system, and include both protected wilderness and protected cultural and historical landmarks (including, surprise surprise, sites significant to indigenous cultures).   They are important not only for the sake of nostalgia, national pride and beauty–although all of those are valuable in their own right–but also for the sake of anthropology, American history, environmental science and biodiversity.  These sites are often of great scientific interest, housing rare species and natural phenomena,   battlefields, and some of the oldest human settlements in the Americas. The locations on this list didn’t become federally protected as a lark.  Most of them were added to this list thanks to a great public outcry, because experience had proven that nothing less was sufficient to protect them.

But this story is intriguing, so I’ll try to summarize it. When trump proposed massive cuts to the EPA budget earlier this year, he unleashed a lot of outrage. His first slap on his face was when Congress decided not to affect most domestic spending provisions for the balance of the current federal fiscal year (ends September 30), including the EPA’s budget. Rather than being slashed 30% or so, it was cut by just 1%. But here’s the better part. trump and his minions were stupid enough (and maybe by law they had to show their stupidity) to break out the huge cuts and apply them to specific programs. For example, he slashes the $300 million Great Lakes Initiative to zero and slashes clean up for the Chesapeake Bay and Puget Sound and the Gulf of Mexico to zero each. That puts at risk the livelihoods of thousands of people who live in the ocean coastal areas and jeopardizes the drinking water for millions of people in the Great Lakes Basin. As a consequence, trump has inadvertently (hence the stupid part) caused unlikely coalitions to form consisting of republican and Democratic senators and congresspeople from red states and blue states to fight these cuts. And as they form coalitions, other programs are benefitting, such as the environmental justice programs that trump proposes to eliminate. So, if this is all true and if these coalitions hold, and if trump continues to piss off politicians by having weekly impeachable moments, looks like the EPA budget will probably be spared, and, in some cases, I wouldn’t be surprised to see increases in budgeted line items for specific programs.
