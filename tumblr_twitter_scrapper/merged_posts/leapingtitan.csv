The birds are singing, Reiner is the Armored Titan, Bertolt is the Colossal Titan.. (not my joke btw), all cool.For the record, I am legit crying with laughter right now. I don’t know if there is exactly a “silver” lining in this situation. You have one side where you speak unholy words unworthy of your place on this world, and on the other side you have the most hilarious word choice accompanied by a dancc sentence structure. The world truly is a wonderful place.As for the third anon, sorry but… that’s, unfortunately for you, quite a narrow minded and frankly, a pathetic way to approach the opposite manner. What you have isn’t even an “opinion”, it’s a way of saying “Please stop talking bad about my opinion, it doesn’t make me feel good and you should just stop because uh.. uhm.. *furiously thinking for a reason and sweating*.. you’re embarrassing yourself..  yeah! That’s what you’re doing!”Although that isn’t necessarily as half-assed as the other two, that’s quite a weak way of getting your point across. If you’re truly that into this fandom and give two shits about it, you would know that there’s:a) Different opinions that don’t always match yoursb) The whole concept of acceptance and understanding.The two words in b) are beautiful, by the way. Go check them out and drink some milk. Milk is good.Sorry but, I really can’t take that statement seriously. I’d say you’d need something to back it up but, you’re unfortunately not doing a good job at conversing like a proper human being. Sorry about that :/So yeah! :D..Oh and, in the event that you are here for a “serious” reply: Your life must be quite miserable and pathetic for you to violently bash your worth-for-nothing overdue-puberty butthurt bullshit “thoughts” on to other people you claim to be in the same fandom with. Disgusting. I feel like I’m going to puke out my own asshole just thinking about the fact I share a planet with a waste of quality oxygen like you.

The thing is, none of the episodes until now had this sort of representation of her character.. or any other character, for that matter. Even the Ymir and Historia moments weren’t overdone and the fans were served something satisfying and appealing, but in no way did it overweight the actual plot and stray from what the series is actually about. This is the second episode I have a problem with, the other one being Episode 3 (28) for its pacing, cut scenes and slightly OOC Levi. I just hope they don’t overdo this in the finale, which is… the biggest point in the entire manga as a whole up till now apart from the Shiganshina arc’s last 5 chapters." True text

And…To answer your question, anon: Yes I do! I get what you mean and this is actually quite a fun thing to talk about. So much, that it even gets its own post!I am a hobbyist when it comes to music and I enjoy the Warriors quite a lot. Before I wrap up that statement with the main event, I have another AU which is my perfect peaceful 1980s Paradis country life, but that’s for another time. As for this one, I always thought it would be cool if these characters were in a band. Usually it’s interesting to see how they would interact and what kind of role they would have, so… putting those obvious facts aside, these would be my ideas: Keep in mind I haven’t written one of these yet so this is a first haha.Zeke Jaeger - Lead Guitar, VocalsMy favorite boi gets the attention, of course! I think him being lead is kind of appropriate since he is the “Lead Warrior” in canon. The hippy/messy hair always reminded me of 80s metalheads, and.. for the record, Takehito Koyasu (Zeke’s seiyuu in the anime) is an amazing singer as well. I feel like he would make a great vocalist. He is a quite literal Beast at the guitar and has endured the pain that is music theory. He dislikes it a lot and instead chooses to play in his own style, usually resulting in him failing to practice properly and bust out mad shredding instead of the actual song. He gets his act together on stage though. He sometimes wishes he would write songs but usually finds it diffucult and leaves it to the rest of the band. He gets along well with the other band members and usually forgets the fact that he is a decade older than them.Reiner Braun - Rhythm Guitar, Writer, occasionally does VocalsReiner sometimes wishes he would be lead, but Zeke is so good at it Reiner doesn’t mind. Reiner is one of the main songwriters and most songs with humorous yet meaningful lyrics are usually written by him. Despite wanting to shred like Zeke, he enjoys playing rhythm and makes those dank expressions you usually don’t make when you play rhythm, such as the extreme faces. Reiner also does additional vocals in some of the songs or the double scream with Zeke. He and Zeke the are the type to spend hours at a music store trying to decide what amp to use and how much money to blow on the newest models. Reiner changes his strings ridiculously often. When not planning a new song with Zeke he usually practices with Bertolt or plays Acoustic in his spare time.Bertolt Hoover - Bass, KeyboardAlthough he doesn’t play the keyboard often, Bertolt is very proficient at Bass and can deliver some amazing lines. He doesn’t like slapping too much but he never makes mistakes while playing. Sometimes he will analyze lyrics that Reiner and Zeke have discussed. He also knows how to play the keyboard though he doesn’t do it too often and instead chooses to focus on bass. He is the type that doesn’t own too many bass guitars and prefers only one. Only one, with a similar tune and too many fancy techniques, though he doesn’t have difficulties pulling them off.Annie Leonhardt - Drums, Vocals, KeyboardAnnie sometimes wishes she had more of an active role writing songs, but Reiner laughs it off and tells her to “leave it to the experts”. Zeke doesn’t mind, but he saves time and just discusses the upcoming song with Reiner. Annie is so good at drums they’re the instrument that stand out during most of the songs instead of Zeke’s insane 130bpm shredding. Everyone admires her for it, and although she doesn’t take much credit she enjoys what she does to the fullest and even shows it, especially during a performance. Her and Bertolt are an inseparable duo in instrumentals and perfectly play in sync, complimenting each other quite well. Annie also does vocals on a somewhat rare occasion for their slower, less heavy songs. She doesn’t have much confidence in her voice though everyone in the band and the audience screams at her otherwise. She also plays the keyboard during said songs and wants Bertolt to learn it, though she doesn’t tell him why.Galliard (Former) - Rhythm GuitarHe used to be in the band but left because of tension between the members. He thought he would go off on his own and improve by himself. In reality, although he was acting like he was in charge and better than the others, he actually felt left behind because of a past experience and instead wished to be able to compare to the others, which is the real reason why he left, even though he told the others the opposite. He used to play rhythm and still does but is away from the others.Pieck - Manager and Audio EngineerPieck is responsible for the band’s equipment and recording sessions. She makes sure the song comes out just right on the technical side and that it’s promoted among the fans in a positive manner. She herself plays the keyboard as well as some traditional and indie instruments, though it’s only a personal hobby.And yeah! By the way,Here is a Song which I believe they would cover and get famous for! (The best part is at 2:20)" True text

Episode 28 (Season 2 Episode 3) had a lot of cut content but it got its point across and stayed true to the lore.. but this time, although it’s the same story as the manga with no changes apart from the filler in the flashback…But my main problem with the episode isn’t what happens in it but what’s depicted as a solid point.Mikasa.I never hated her. I never “hated” anyone in Attack on Titan for that matter. I dislike Marco, but I still thought every single character was thought out and had some kind of life to them. However, this is a different problem this time.I never saw anything wrong with Mikasa in the manga during all the time I’ve read it. However, the way this episode depicted it, it shows a one-sided concern and affection towards Eren and an over-attachment which was NOT depicted with such means in Season 1. We all know how she feels, we know what happens in Chapter 50.. but the anime is overdoing it. Annie was a victim of this as well if you compare Manga Annie to Anime Annie. The overall depiction is irritating and overdone to the point where it’s trying to be the main attraction of the entire story, while most of the people watching LOGICALLY care about the fact that Eren was taken away by his own friends and it could potentially reveal a major secret, if you were to think as an anime-only viewer.For the record, I am NOT comparing current Anime Mikasa to Post-Basement Mikasa since, let’s be real, she has gotten basically 0 solid build and development since Chapter 50. You may consider her relationship with Armin during the Return Arc, but apart from that, and at least in my eyes, Mikasa has not changed one bit since Chapter 50.Once again, however, this is not even the main point. Back when I read Chapter 50, I was excited about the way her relationship with Eren was portrayed. However, I NEVER saw it as the main highlight of the chapter OR the entire arc. Maybe it’s because I’m more or less not that much of a “shipper” and care more about the lore and story, and to me, that whole moment was only meant to make the activation of the Coordinate more epic, which is what I mostly cared about.To be completely blunt, I dislike the way Mikasa is portrayed in this episode as well as potentially the rest of Season 2. Something that will redeem itself, MAYBE. MAYBE redeem itself is going to be the season finale, IF they manage to balance out and back her portrayal in this episode. However, as far as I am concerned, Eren has had a shit life but never gave up, instead everyone was going to save him. You may compare him to Armin, however he was the only one behaving rationally and in-character this episode, possibly for the rest of the arc as well. You can see it the way Eren reacts when Mikasa arrives. He didn’t want her to go over there and he wanted to do it himself, but he couldn’t. The way their teamwork was portrayed last week’s episode, as well as Episode 26 when he wakes up was done nicely, not subtly, but not shoved balls deep into the reader/viewer’s face like in this episode.As far as I am concerned, this is a case of anime-adaptation gone overboard. I am not entirely sure but I DO NOT think this is how Isayama portrayed Mikasa in the manga during this very same time period. The season finale has the potential of reedeming this to me, but considering what was shown here, I can’t help but feel like they are trying to give focus to something which is not the main point of the episode. Like, this boy just got betrayed by his friends of three years who taught him how to not die in a world that is this fucking messed up and gave him some sort of light in a gigantic void full of darkness. How about all the mysteries?“This world becomes a bigger mess with every passing day.”Yeah… yes, right? Right? I think so too.. that’s what I think about.My favorite part of this episode is…. the preview for next episode, unfortunately. I enjoyed seeing Jean again as well as the report of the situation. And I absolutely enjoyed seeing the man Erwin himself, coming in to ACTUALLY get shit done and worry about what’s in front of him. Also, although my overall mood wasn’t at its peak before Eren woke up, hearing Eren the Coordinate used for the first time and seeing the SCs head out gave me that “Alright.. it’s time to get shit done” feeling, just like that from Erwin. I am looking forward to this upcoming shitstorm. This, and not anything else in particular.Overall Rating: 4.5/10" True text

Which is a lot less exciting, haha, but to both of us this bit looks identical to the thing lying on the ground, and its presence is pretty easy to explain (presumably, it fell off the gear of someone now dead), so… I’m afraid such is the conclusion momtaku and I are coming to in regards to this!  That does seem more likely, yes! But isn’t that part of the 3DMG like a barrel and a lot bigger? I mean, the object even had its own panel and Ymir is looking at it like dafuq. I don’t know lol. From googling 3DMG, it doesn’t seem like it’s much bigger? To me, anyway, hah. Comparing that thing in ch40 to the 3DMG part and to the vial in ch66, it looks a lot more like the part, but of course the titan investigation agency is not infallible, so the usual imho’s apply! I see. Well, ignoring the vial, I think that’s what happened to Ymir." False link

We all… The titan investigation agency hears your call! :DDDIn all seriousness, though, thank you for your vote of confidence, but, as far as Castle Utgard and its possible connection to the Beast Titan go, let’s just say it’s a mystery wrapped in herring an enigma. Personally, I agree with you that the BT isn’t part of Ymir’s people, but at this point it’s pure speculation. To the first (and main!) part of your post, though: as far as momtaku and I can tell, that vial-like thing is actually this part of 3DMG?? Which is a lot less exciting, haha, but to both of us this bit looks identical to the thing lying on the ground, and its presence is pretty easy to explain (presumably, it fell off the gear of someone now dead), so… I’m afraid such is the conclusion momtaku and I are coming to in regards to this!  That does seem more likely, yes! But isn’t that part of the 3DMG like a barrel and a lot bigger? I mean, the object even had its own panel and Ymir is looking at it like dafuq. I don’t know lol." False link

A few years before the events of 845, Grisha stopped an epidemic that plagued Shiganshina. At first, I thought it could be something like measles or other… " False link
