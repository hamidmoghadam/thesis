I DON’T KNOW HOW I FORGOT THIS IN MY FIRST VERSION OF THIS POST BUT GMO’S ARE NOT DANGEROUS TO EAT. GMO’S ARE SAVING LIVES. YOU’VE ALREADY EATEN GMO’S BEFORE YOU EVEN KNEW THE TERM. IT’S FINE. EAT THEM.  It pisses me off when big time chefs go “guys do you not know what goes into canned meatballs? They’re disgusting!” yeah parts of the animal they don’t use for anything else and also they’re tasty fuck you  Sorry but like you’re kinda wrong with some of these? This is the stuff that I work with so uh let me try and make a brief list.  1. Organic food is better for you but more importantly it’s better for the farm it’s grown on and for the environment. Not using industrial farming techniques builds up microscopic life and fungi in the soil which actually makes for a higher yielding farm as it isn’t as affected as harshly by drought years or irregular weather as well as less soil erosion. Not using heavy pesticides also means more bees which is kinda important as many of them are dying off from farm pesticide use.  2. Whereas “Organic” farms have a strict set of rules they have to abide by and be annually re-certified in order to call their products organic you’re right when it comes to “natural” products. Really, anybody can slap the label “Natural” on any product if they want to. 3. Again you’re right that these fatty foods aren’t trash. It became trendy in the 60′s through the 80′s to cut fat out of your diet, that fat & grease were really bad for you but really it’s kinda the opposite. Fat is extremely important to have in your diet and many people's ancestors lived quite healthily on diets of near 60% fat. The problem with pizza & fried chicken & such comes from eating them on a regular basis without variation in one’s diet and the amount of sugar included in candy & fast food. Not taking your nutritional intake into account can actually, no joke, lead to depression, irritability, and random bouts of anger which sounds wacky but is scarily true. 4. The bourgeoisie looking down on people who can’t afford to eat well is fucked up and it’s something that the food industry perpetuates and takes advantage of similarly to the beauty industry takes advantage of self-image issues. That being said there are options to eating healthier that aren’t more expensive. Cooking for yourself and buying fewer frozen meals is a go-to for healthier eating, You don’t need to buy the organic produce if you don’t want to but try to incorporate more vegetables and fruit into your diet, cook large meals & store leftovers in the fridge for the next few days & you’ll find yourself spending overall less money and eating healthier. I understand it can be a significant challenge to those living in food deserts, for one my cousins in Montana typically can’t buy produce where they live and if it’s available it’s far too expensive for what it is. Where I live I go to farm stands and farmers markets, avoiding supermarkets when I can. The prices are cheaper, my money goes to the actual people producing the food instead of corporations, and the food I get is grown in my area. Some of the work I’m pursuing is making healthy food accessible to all, eating right shouldn’t be hampered by someone’s income.  5. Processed food in and of itself isn’t bad just as canned food isn’t inherently bad. Many people don’t have the time or resources to process their own food honestly. The biggest problem with process food is that there are a lot of foods that once their cut up, once they’re prepared, they immediately start to degrade. By the time it gets to you & you’re able to eat it many of the nutritional aspects of it have been halved just from the half-life of the material in the dead plant/animal. Buying the product in its full form it’s already been dead and transported and has been sitting on a shelf and has lost some of its potency but not nearly as much as when it’s already processed in a factory. A problem I have with processed food that isn’t as concerning or related is that it removes us even further from the thing that’s died to give us food. Everybody eats but very few of us now have to deal with that aspect of death along with the preparation of a product from start to finish.  6. I completely agree everything is made up of chemicals and fruit, in particular, are full of hundreds of different individual compounds many of which have long hard to pronounce names. Thankfully our ancestors were scavengers and there’s a lot of compounds we can digest that would hurt other animals.  7. You’re right, without preservatives we wouldn’t be able to maintain the amount of food the world eats on a daily basis with the current farming techniques we employ. That doesn’t mean we need them though nor does that mean they’re good for us.  8. MSG might not be bad for you but there’s a lot of people that have migraines from eating MSG so at least label that shit.  9. I agree here too & I want to point to the 50′s post-war culture that devalued “lesser” cuts of meat and animal parts. Many of these odds & ends can be turned into tasty cured meats or head cheese. If anything I suggest visiting your local butcher, if you have one. Their prices, especially for “less desirable” cuts, might surprise you and they could definitely use the business.  10. Really gotta disagree. Not talking about eating the food its self but GMO companies are kinda destroying small farms and running family operated farms out of business but more importantly, they’re patenting genomes. Monsanto is a key name in this talk when neighboring farms inevitably show signs of Monsanto brand plant life because of they fucking breed through the air, they sue them and run them out of business. To talk again about Organic farms, actual production output of a GMO farm with all its anti-fungal disease resistant crops is roughly the same as an organic farm working in tandem with the land instead of trying to “tame” the land. The GMO food that’s extra big too is mostly water weight, it’s not actually any more full of nutrition than other smaller organically produced produce. On top of that engineering, your food to be pesticide resistant when you could instead plant it beside pest deterrent species or other such techniques is contributing to the overuse of pesticides which is causing out bee scare alongside the acidification of our oceans. And yeah uh GMO isn’t good for you. As an example, many of the people who are gluten-intolerant, my brother included, aren’t actually 100% allergic to wheat but are allergic to GMO round-up-ready wheat, a GMO wheat that’s been made to able to handle round-up pesticides. These people can eat non-round-up-ready wheat with no problem but because of factory food processing that mixes flours from different farms, because of people not knowing exactly where their food comes from, they have to turn away all wheat unless they’re 100% certain where it comes from.  " False text

The world needs to know.   Update 1: They’re exchanging fire from both sides. Electricity is down. Friends are reporting that ISIS members are spotted in the schools and are giving them a few minutes to evacuate before they take over. Filipino media is silent.   Update 2: Christian teachers are being held hostage.   Update 3: Hospital staff being detained, ISIS flag has been raised in the city hospital. The fighting occurred not in the outskirts of Marawi, but on its streets, around the city hall and public market. I’m sorry, I’m stringing together what information my friends are still giving me. I don’t know how long they can keep this up - a lot of them are saying that their phones are dying.   Update 4: Armed Forces of the Philippines telling people to go underground, airstrikes coming. Mortars are being prepared too.  UPDATE 5: The Philippine President and his family are in Russia. The Palace remains silent. The military is trying to invalidate ground reports to cover up their fuckups.   UPDATE 6: Philippine National Police and Armed Forces of the Philippines are not responding or have deployed extremely delayed support, according to the Marawi City Mayor in a phone interview.   UPDATE 7: CNN Philippines has a livestream covering the entire thing, eyewitness reports are in, Military is still saying “we’re in full control” when that’s obviously not the case.  https://web.facebook.com/CNNPhilippines/videos/1933243386915551/  UPDATE 8: reports in that terrorists are targeting cell towers now.   UPDATE 9: GENERALS POINTING FINGERS AT EACH OTHER INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE.  UPDATE 10: ARMED FORCES STILL LYING ABOUT THE SCALE OF THIS ATTACK. THEY SAY 15 MEN, WHEN ALL CORRESPONDENTS ARE SAYING THERE ARE AT LEAST 200.  UPDATE 11: generals trivializing the situation, saying “they don’t feel like it’ll last the night,” when people are literally saying that the fighting still continues. CNN just cut their livestream, will be back in 30 minutes, most are being left in the dark about what’s going on.  at this point, i’m at a loss for words. most friends have stopped updating 30 minutes ago. sporadic updates remain.   Update 12: NEW CNN LIVESTREAM LINK https://www.facebook.com/1515763818663512/videos/1933414370231786  UPDATE 13.

Very important reminder: You do not need a reason to leave a relationship. Neither does the other person (or people). A relationship is over when one of the people in it says it’s over, period. Obviously it’s kind to take the end of a long relationship seriously, but abusers and manipulators have lost the right to that conversation. Lie if you need to–your safety is much more important than their feelings. Trust your instincts!

So, I don’t know if you’ve heard but the Wonder Woman film comes out June 2nd… And if you didn’t know that, there’s a reason for it. Warner Brothers aren’t spending money on promoting the Wonder Woman film. No tv promotions, billboards, nothing. A film about a strong, powerful, amazing woman superhero directed by Patty Jenkins who happens to be the first woman to direct a superhero film with a female protagonist and one of only a handful (a literal handful… you can count on one hand) to direct a superhero film at all. They are setting it up to fail so they can say “I told you so” and not only continue the blatant sexism in the film industry but blame it on Patty if the movie fails, setting female directors up (whom are already told they won’t get hired) so they can have an excuse to say “Oh well, we tried hiring a woman to direct a film and it didn’t work. Lets not do that again.” This film is bigger than just being a superhero movie… It has the ability to bust open the glass ceiling of Hollywood to tell them that yes, superhero movies about women do well and yes, women can not only direct blockbusters but they can do it well. Because I can guarantee you, Patty does it well. PLEASE spread this around and let Warner Brothers know we aren’t going to stand for this bullshit. GO SEE WONDER WOMAN JUNE 2nd!!!  This is a called a glass cliff (when men put women in positions of power + set them up to fail). I hope it doesn’t work this time!  An article that highlights the budget differences between super hero movies, such as super man, in comparison to wonder Woman’s : https://filmschoolrejects.com/we-need-to-talk-about-that-wonder-woman-budget-ef4b1b70f6d8/   Some articles talking about exactly this: http://uproxx.com/hitfix/wonder-woman-no-promotion/2/ http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/04/wonder-woman-marketing http://www.vogue.com/article/wonder-woman-gal-gadot-bad-marketing-promotion  Go see this movie!

Theres no promotion for it?! I thought it was me and my disconnection to the tv world I think I mostly have followers that are Marvel fans, but come on, y'all. I’ve heard for YEARS how bad you want a female superhero movie. It’s not a Marvel character, and it’s not a Black Widow movie, but you won’t get either of those if Wonder Woman fails. Go out, see this movie, then go and see it again. The reviews, so far, have been really good with some critics claiming it as “the best DC movie yet” (http://comicbook.com/dc/2017/05/19/wonder-woman-first-review-reactions/).

From what I read in the article, the bill seeks to outlaw conversion therapy by saying that it is fraudulent to treat medical conditions that don’t exist, but because being trans is classed as a medical condition, that would mean it’s left out.

It took me days to get time together to read this whole thing, but I have finally done it.This is it. This is the one article you need to read to understand just what is going on in Britain, America, and Russia. This is the one piece of writing you need and can use to reference the very chilling reality that these countries have been tied together in the machinations  of just a few billionaires, and how Facebook and Google tie in insidiouslyi. I keep telling y’all to stop fucking with facebook but that’s moot now. It’s so much bigger than this. “Was that really what you called it, I ask him. Psychological warfare? “Totally. That’s what it is. Psyops. Psychological operations – the same methods the military use to effect mass sentiment change. It’s what they mean by winning ‘hearts and minds’. We were just doing it to win elections in the kind of developing countries that don’t have many rules.”Why would anyone want to intern with a psychological warfare firm, I ask him. And he looks at me like I am mad. “It was like working for MI6. Only it’s MI6 for hire. It was very posh, very English, run by an old Etonian and you got to do some really cool things. Fly all over the world. You were working with the president of Kenya or Ghana or wherever. It’s not like election campaigns in the west. You got to do all sorts of crazy shit.”“ This is not just a story about social psychology and data analytics.  It has to be understood in terms of a military contractor using military strategies on a civilian population.  Us. David Miller, a professor of sociology at Bath University and an authority in psyops and propaganda, says it is “an extraordinary scandal that this should be anywhere near a democracy. It should be clear to voters where information is coming from, and if it’s not transparent or open where it’s coming from, it raises the question of whether we are actually living in a democracy or not.” “And it was Facebook that made it possible. It was from Facebook that Cambridge Analytica obtained its vast dataset in the first place. Earlier, psychologists at Cambridge University harvested Facebook data (legally) for research purposes and published pioneering peer-reviewed work about determining personality traits, political partisanship, sexuality and much more from people’s Facebook “likes”. And SCL/Cambridge Analytica contracted a scientist at the university, Dr Aleksandr Kogan, to harvest new Facebook data. And he did so by paying people to take a personality quiz which also allowed not just their own Facebook profiles to be harvested, but also those of their friends – a process then allowed by the social network.” Read this. Read the entire thing. It will take you a while and it’s a lot to digest but you need to know.Signal boost. @sunderlorn we’re finally completely united in propaganda, isn’t that nice!? " False link

First of all, in a sexual species, you can have females be XX and males be X (insects), you can have females be ZW and males be ZZ (birds), you can have females be females because they developed in a warm environment and males be males because they developed in a cool environment (reptiles), you can have females be females because they lost a penis sword fighting contest (some flatworms), you can have males be males because they were born female, but changed sexes because the only male in their group died (parrotfish and clownfish), you can have males look and act like females because they are trying to get close enough to actual females to mate with them (cuttlefish, bluegills, others), or you can be one of thousands of sexes (slime mold, some mushrooms.) Oh, did you mean humans? Oh ok then. You can be male because you were born female, but you have 5-alphareductase deficiency and so you grew a penis at age 12. You can be female because you have an X and a Y chromosome but you are insensitive to androgens, and so you have a female body. You can be female because you have an X and a Y chromosome but your Y is missing the SRY gene, and so you have a female body. You can be male because you have two X chromosomes, but one of your X’s HAS an SRY gene, and so you have a male body. You can be male because you have two X chromosomes- but also a Y. You can be female because you have only one X chromosome at all. And you can be male because you have two X chromosomes, but your heart and brain are male. And vice - effing - versa. Don’t use science to justify your bigotry. The world is way too weird for that shit.  " False link

The Russian newspaper says it confirmed the news with government officials and an analyst of the region also confirmed the news to the Times with her own sources. Three men are known to have been murdered, although the real number is likely to be higher.  in almost every genocide, the first “act” is the rounding up and killing of a group of men, specifically.  In “root and branch” genocides they [”civilian men of ‘battle age’”] are often the first group to be separated out and massacred, paving the way for the murder of women, children, and elderly men. In more common articulations of genocide, however, they can be the only group slated for outright massacre, while women, children, and elderly men suffer a range of alternative fates involving rape, sexual exploitation, torture, forced maternity, murder, and expulsion. Gender and the Future of Genocide Studies and Prevention   as the rest of this article explains this isn’t to say that men have it worst in a genocide, but that it’s important when you see a very common red flag for genocide to pay attention to the “conflict” in case any more markers of an impending genocide occur.  the g word is really loaded and i’m not bringing this up because i want to start an avalanche of “CHECHNYA IS COMMITTING GENOCIDE AGAINST GAY PEOPLE” fear mongering (that is the absolute last thing that i want). it’s just not possible to prevent any genocide without questioning whether a current conflict might eventually get there. and i do not think it’s nothing that genocide watch is reporting on this.  UPDATE 4/10/17 Chechnya has opened concentration camps for gay men    Gay men arrested in a ‘purge’ in the Russian region of Chechnya are being held in concentration camp-style prisons, reports have alleged. Early reports emerged earlier this month that gay people are being targeted in the region, which is part of Russia but has substantial autonomy. Russian newspapers and human rights groups report that more than 100 gay men have been detained “in connection with their non-traditional sexual orientation, or suspicion of such” as part of a purge. Several people were also reportedly feared dead following violent raids. In a chilling response, a Chechen government spokesperson denied that there are any gay people to detain, insisting that “you can’t detain and harass someone who doesn’t exist in the republic”. The Kremlin denied any knowledge of a purge. But reports have since emerged that the men arrested are being kept in horrific concentration camp prisons, where violent abuse and torture is common. Based on interviews with eyewitnesses and survivors, Novaya Gazeta reports that a secret prison has been set up in the town of Argun to detain the men arrested in the purge. One man who was released from the camp told the newspaper that he was subjected to violent “interrogations” at the camp, as Chechen officials attempted to get him to confess the names and locations of more gay men. The officials also seized his mobile phone, targeting his network of contacts regardless of whether they were gay or not. The camp was reportedly set up by Chechen forces in a former military headquarters in the town. The newspaper reports allegations that the Speaker of the Parliament of Chechnya was among officials to visit the site, though the claims have not been substantiated. The detainees face electric shock torture and violent beatings, while some of them have been held to ransom and used to extort their families. Tanya Lokshina of Human Rights Watch wrote: “For several weeks now, a brutal campaign against LGBT people has been sweeping through Chechnya. She continued: “Law enforcement and security agency officials under control of the ruthless head of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, have rounded up dozens of men on suspicion of being gay, torturing and humiliating the victims. “Some of the men have forcibly disappeared. Others were returned to their families barely alive from beatings. At least three men apparently have died since this brutal campaign began.” She added: “These days, very few people in Chechnya dare speak to human rights monitors or journalists even anonymously because the climate of fear is overwhelming and people have been largely intimidated into silence. “Filing an official complaint against local security officials is extremely dangerous, as retaliation by local authorities is practically inevitable. “It is difficult to overstate just how vulnerable LGBT people are in Chechnya, where homophobia is intense and rampant. “LGBT people are in danger not only of persecution by the authorities but also of falling victim to ‘honour killings’ by their own relatives for tarnishing family honour.”  What Can We Do?    Alexander Artmyev from Amnesty International spoke to Metro.co.uk. He said that people who are not in Russia can help by joining the charity’s Urgent Action on Chechnya. The action encourages people to write in Russian or your own language to Chairman of the Investigation Committee and Acting Head of the Investigation Committee for the Chechen Republic. Amnesty has also asked the letter, which should ask for an investigation and appeal for protection for LGBT individuals, to be copied into Human Rights groups and diplomatic missions from your country.
