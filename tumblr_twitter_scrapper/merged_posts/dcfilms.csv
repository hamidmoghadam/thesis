When he goes  to sail to London, Diana decides to go with him because she believes  that Ares is behind World War I.– She grabs her armor, bracelets, sword, and shield from Themiscyra before leaving with Trevor.– Once in London, the film becomes a bit of a fish out of water story  as Diana, who is naïve and hopeful, is fascinated by the “modern” world  (the film takes place in 1918).– The main human villains are the  rogue German general Ludendorff (Danny Huston) and the scarred  scientist Dr. Maru (Elena Anaya), who devises various poisons. There’s  also the specter of the god of war Ares’ involvement in the larger  scheme of things.– David Thewlis plays Assemblyman Sir Patrick Morton, a British politician advocating for peace.–  Overall, the film looks like a bit of a combination between Thor and  Captain America: The First Avenger. The stuff in Themiscyra is Thor (a  god who has never known the human world) and the stuff in World War I is  Captain America (a  superhero in the middle of a worldwide, mechanized war), and audiences,  having accepted both those movies, should have no trouble investing in  the tone Jenkins’ is going for.The Filming- The film is being shot in 35mm, not IMAX– On the day we visited, we saw Gadot running on a treadmill in front  of a green screen and “deflecting” bullets with her magical gauntlets.– Even from afar, the costume looks badass.– Jenkins is shouting out, “Bang! Block!” as Gadot deflects the non-existent bullets headed her way.– There’s more of Gadot on the treadmill, we go to lunch, come back,  there’s more treadmill but from a different camera angle. Then we get to  talk to Gadot.Gal Gadot- The best thing about playing Wonder Woman is this is exactly the  kind of role she wanted to play when she started acting eight years  ago—a strong, independent woman.– She loves everything about Diana. “She has a heart of a human being, powers of goddess and a very wise brain,” says Gadot.– Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor balance each other out. He  understands the dark side of human nature, and she’s an idealist, so he  helps inform her worldview, and she brings hope back into his life.–  While the Wonder Woman we see in Batman v Superman is a more mature  woman, the one we see in this origin story is a bit more naïve and  positive.– Wonder Woman doesn’t really see a difference between men and women in terms of social mores or abilities.– She’s glad this movie is being made because it will give young  girls like her daughter a figure to look up to like boys have had with  Superman, Batman, and Spider-Man.– When she was first cast as Wonder Woman, she went back and watched some reruns of the Lynda Carter Wonder Woman from the 70s.– Wonder Woman’s fighting style is a mix of martial arts that Gadot calls, “WonderFu”.Costumes- Costume Designer Lindy Hemming (The Dark Knight) walked us through some of the designs and oufits.– She says that the Wonder Woman armor for Wonder Woman only has some minor changes from what we saw in Batman v Superman.– Unsurprisingly, she looked to Greek influences when designing the armor for the Amazons.– This is one of the most design-heavy jobs she’s had to do because of the different eras and settings.– It was important for Jenkins that the Amazons not be just one race or body type.– There are 8 different versions of the Wonder Woman costume, and  they’ll probably have to make around 20 to 30 for the various stunt  people and stand-ins.– The challenge has been to merge the unreality of Wonder Woman’s  world with the reality of World War I, and then trying to get those  realistic costumes right.– When it came to the armor, Hemming also had to deal with the  challenge of creating armor that was both sturdy enough to look like it  could take a beating, but also allowed the actors to move and do their  stunts.– Gadot’s main input was trying to look for comfort where possible  given the stuntwork and external elements like weather, but Hemming  unfortunately “couldn’t help her very much.”Second Unit Filming- We then moved on to a World War I set and the details are amazing. Production Designer Aline Bonetto  has put together some really impressive production design for the  bombed out city of Veld. Everything from the storefronts to the  advertisements looks absolutely on point.– In this scene, Diana,  Trevor, and their fellow fighters Charlie (Ewen Bremner), Sameer (Saïd  Taghmaoui), and Chief (Eugene Brave Rock) are making their way to the  front.– They’re shooting with the Phantom Red, which has the advantage of  being able to really speed up the number of frames per second thus  allowing for highly-detailed slow-motion.– In the scene, Trevor (what we saw on the day was being handled by  Chris Pine’s stunt double) is laying down some shotgun action as he  takes down some German soldiers.– The only sunny days they’ve had were in Veld when they didn’t need the sun.– We then moved on to some trenches, which were appropriately grim.  It’s a bit jarring to be on the set of a superhero film and then go to a  recreation of a gruesome war zone that’s meant to evoke where countless  men suffered and died in battle.– We then moved on to the Throne Room set, which wasn’t being used at  that time. While there was a bit of whiplash for me personally having  just walked through World War I trenches, I doubt there will be for an  audience that has seen a variety of superhero movies. Also, it’s not  like the trench scene precedes the throne room scene in the film.Director Patty Jenkins- Our set visit in London ended after checking out the trenches and  the throne room, but we weren’t done yet. We didn’t get a chance to  interview Jenkins while on set because she was so busy, but thankfully,  Warner Bros. brought us back to London a year later to do an edit bay  visit with Jenkins. We saw some scenes and then spoke to Jenkins about  the film.– While she’s aware of the politics of the moment, she hopes that  people will see Wonder Woman as a universal character; while there are  comments on sexism, it’s not a “woman” movie. It’s a Wonder Woman movie  intended to be on par with any other superhero origin film.– Richard Donner’s Superman had a huge effect on her when she was a kid, even more than Star Wars.– She thinks that Wonder Woman stands apart from heroes like Batman  and Superman because she’s guided by an almost religious-like belief  system that demands she behave in a certain way. “She believes in love,  and she believes in truth.” Jenkins goes on to describe Wonder Woman’s  worldview as, “I believe in the betterment of you, and I believe in you,  and I believe in truth. And I believe that you all can be better, and I  will fight to protect you. But I also believe in better than that.”– She also believes that Wonder Woman fights not because she wants to, but because she has to for the betterment of mankind.– The film won’t delve too much into Dr. Maru’s backstory, but her  driving motivation is that she’s someone who has suffered a lot of pain,  and now delights in seeing that kind of pain inflicted on others to  prove that they’re not as strong as her.– While at first she was a bit bummed that she didn’t get to cast  Wonder Woman, once she met Gadot, all her fears were put to rest.– What made her want to do the movie was being on the same page as the studio in wanting to tell Wonder Woman’s origin story.– She didn’t even see Batman v Superman until she was halfway done making Wonder Woman.– The studio always supported her vision (while this may sound like  director-speak, I will say that they walked us through the plot on set  and then again in the edit bay for people who weren’t on the set visit;  the two plots match up, so there haven’t been any major changes).– There was never any pressure to try and tie the story to the  present day, and while Jenkins did hint that the ending will probably  connect in some way to Justice League, this is first and foremost an origin story for Wonder Woman.– Jenkins doesn’t believe Wonder Woman’s origin story is more  complicated than any other superhero’s; it’s just that those superheroes  have gotten movies to popularize those origin stories. She notes that  most people probably didn’t know Superman’s history until Richard  Donner’s film. That’s what they’re hoping to do with Wonder Woman.– It was important to nail the tone and make sure that they could hit  that “small pocket” of not making the World War I stuff look too much  like a BBC documentary, but also not being campy by having a person in a  superhero costume walking through a battlefield.– There are “hundreds of things” Jenkins would like to do with Wonder Woman beyond the character’s origin story.– Jenkins wanted to make sure that humor was a part of the story because she felt that was honest to life.– There was no mandate on the tone of her movie.[source]" True text

Jason Momoa plays the title character, and Wilson will play the fish whisperer’s super-villain half brother Orm, also known as Ocean Master, in the DC film that Warner Bros will release October 5, 2018. The character has some of the sibling rivalry elements found in Loki. That is Thor’s half brother who has figured as the heavy in numerous Marvel films, in the form of Tom Hiddleston. Orm is at least as disagreeable and more powerful: in the comics, Aquaman’s human half-brother is a rival for the throne of Atlantis, and wreaks havoc on the high seas and beneath them when he doesn’t get his way. Amber Heard as Mera, is playing Queen of Atlantis. [source]" True text

The present day story of Suicide Squad takes place after the  events of Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, and is connected to Batman  v Superman “in many ways.” The film has a fractured narrative, with a number of flashbacks that  reveal more of The Joker and Harley Quinn’s relationship in the world  of casinos and gangsters. The Joker as a character was on the table, but they didn’t want to  move forward with him until they had a part worthy of a great actor and a  great actor who would play the part. The film is a true ensemble, but Deadshot is the proverbial leader and Ayer says “this is really Will Smith’s movie.” For comics research, Margot Robbie sought out as many Harley Quinn  comics as she could and then used the comics she got for Christmas,  right after she got the role, to prepare. To justify Harley Quinn’s twisted relationship with The Joker,  Robbie settled on codependency and compulsion as what drives her to keep  going back to him. In rehearsals, David Ayer would push Robbie to jump on any weak  spots her co-stars revealed and increase the tension as Harley Quinn,  which is the opposite of what Robbie herself wanted to do.  The intense rehearsal process consisted of Ayer pulling out deeply  personal aspects of each actor to fully flesh out their characters.Harley Quinn is “nuts” when she’s with the Joker, but when she’s  interacting with the rest of the Suicide Squad without Joker, Robbie  says she’s “a little more focused.” Joel Kinnaman’s Rick Flag is described as the “right hand man” of Amanda Waller. Kinnaman gained 30 pounds in two months to beef up to play the character. They made an effort to make real, full-bodied characters instead of  simply straight-up villains, but some will be more redeemable than  others. The “adversaries” in the film are being kept under wraps, but the  producers hinted that they may not actually be pulling their own levers. The second unit director is Guy Norris, who worked on Mad Max: Fury Road. Putting Batman in the film was David Ayer’s idea and desire, because  he has such a strong connection to so many of the characters in Belle  Reve. Katana will have her Soultaker sword and yes, she speaks to it. They chose to shoot the outdoor Batmobile scenes knowing full well  set photos and videos would leak, but they didn’t want to compromise the  integrity of practical effects and using real streets. Before they started shooting the outdoor Batmobile scenes, they  paraded it up and down the street so all the fans who had lined up could  get their pictures out of the way. Scott Eastwood plays a Navy SEAL that’s part of the main mission alongside the Suicide Squad, not a comics character. Ayer chose which members of the Squad would be in the movie. There  was no mandate from the studio. But he did collaborate with Geoff Johns  when it came to crafting certain stories for some of the characters.  While on set, the producers stressed that the film has a tremendous  sense of humor as a result of putting this dysfunctional family  together. David Ayer wrote the character of Deadshot for Will Smith. Deadshot is in his mask for a fair amount of time of the film. Diablo’s fire powers are a mix of practical and CG effects. Diablo’s prison cell can be flooded if he starts to light up. All of the actors would worked out together during their downtime. During rehearsals, Ayer had the cast spar with one another. David Ayer would come up with new ideas on set, or hand over new  pages that he just wrote that ended up being an entire monologue. There’s a love story between Rick Flag and June Moone. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje had to practice a lot in the mirror with  his Killer Croc mask to figure out how intensely he needed to push out  his facial expressions When creating the look of Killer Croc, Ayer and Akinnuoye-Agbaje  wanted to ground him in reality as much as possible, so many of the skin  tones are blended with the actor’s real skin tones. The full body Killer Croc makeup took six hours to put on. For research, Akinnuoye-Agbaje went down to the everglades in Fort  Lauderdale to watch and videotape crocodiles. This lead to him  developing signature moves for his character when he launches into his  prey. Akinnuoye-Agbaje developed a specific walk for Killer Croc that is sinuous, almost as if he’s moving through water. During filming, Akinnuoye-Agbaje deliberately kept himself away from the cast so that they would be wary of him. Killer Croc has a Bronx accent. Akinnuoye-Agbaje worked with a dialogue coach. The back of Katana’s jacket says “Soultaker”, and her costume is  covered with calligraphy that means “A Thousand Years,” “Soultaker,” and  “For Him I Weep.”  In terms of design, Ayer wanted all of the Suicide Squad to come from a  very gritty, real-based urban world, with Joker at the top of the  criminal underworld tree. One of the first things costume designer Kate Hawley was asked to  work on was Joker’s ring, which is like a papal ring. Some of the  Joker’s design was inspired by bespoke Mexican cartel leaders. One of the early ideas for Joker’s tattoos was that Harley Quinn had  tattooed him, sort of scribbling on him while he was out of it one  night. The female-dominated costume department were big fans of this  iteration of Harley Quinn, who in many ways is an alpha right alongside  Joker, and they started out with a motto for her as a dominant woman:  “People like you need to fuck people like me.” They explored the design of Harley Quinn thoroughly before settling  on the final costume, even going so far as to mock up the original  jester’s costume. There’s a reinvention in the film of the moment from the comics with  the traditional Joker in the black-and-white tailcoat holding Harley. There’s a scene in one of Joker’s clubs in which he has gold go-go dancers all wearing Batman masks. Enchantress’ costume designs are all rooted in North American history. Karen Fukuhara, who plays Katana, said she read through the Katana  comics and Birds of Prey to prepare, but she added, “I come from a very  Japanese family so it wasn’t that hard to understand her as a person.”   To audition for Katana, Fukhara had to perform a monologue and then do  both a martial arts demonstration and a sword fighting demonstration. Katana’s backstory involving her family isn’t explicitly addressed  in the film, but the soul of her husband is in her sword and she does  have conversations with it. Katana has a strong bond with Rick Flag. Will Smith would rap with the cast in between takes. Early designs for The Joker included his iconic purple suit, but after Jared Leto signed on the take on the character evolved. In order to keep the film’s secrets secure, no one got a hard copy of the script—it was all done online. Midway City—a city so named because it falls midway between Gotham and Metropolis—figures into the film. [Source: Collider]" True text

The film  isn’t entirely linear and involves plenty of flashbacks, but the  present day scenes begin at Belle Reve prison—a penitentiary located in  remote Louisiana that officially doesn’t exist. The purpose of the  prison is to house individuals that have superpowers, whom the  government doesn’t entirely understand. All of the Suicide Squad members  have their own, separate cells and have no interaction with each  other—until Amanda Waller is in need of an expendable team of assassins,  that is.The Joker, meanwhile, is holed up in an old, decrepit Arkham Asylum,  where Harley Quinn is also being housed. Quinn is considered so  psychologically dangerous that she is held in a Hannibal Lecter-style  cell that’s entirely open, and the guards are continually rotated so  that she can’t get too deep inside one person’s head.[Source: Collider]" True text

The  answer, according to ruthless intelligence officer Amanda Waller (Viola  Davis), is to recruit society’s most vile criminals, armed with lethal  skills and superhuman powers. Her first target is possessed  archaeologist June Moone/Enchantress (Cara Delevingne).Waller’s program doesn’t get a green light, though, until Midway City  is threatened by a powerful mystical enemy, and Waller needs to  activate the whole squad of prisoners. The baddies get a break. Deadshot  (Will Smith) has his Second Amendment rights ­reinstated, Harley  (Margot Robbie) is carefully excised from her birdcage, Diablo (Jay  ­Hernandez) is released from his own fireproof fortress of solitude,  Boomerang (Jai Courtney) and Slipknot (Adam Beach) strap their weapons  back on, and Killer Croc ­(Adewale Akinnuoye-­Agbaje) is popped from his  swamp. The one condition for their restricted freedom: Obey orders or  die, a rule strictly enforced by squad leader Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman),  his samurai Katana (Karen Fukuhara), and the explosive devices  inserted into their necks courtesy of Wayne Enterprises. (Thanks,  Batman!) Throwing a wrench into all these plans is the tatted Gotham  City arch-criminal, the Joker (Jared Leto), and his laser-like plan to  reunite with his true love, Harley, mission be damned.But a funny thing happens while these scumbags try to become heroes –  they each must absolve themselves of their crimes even if society  won’t. And that’s where it gets interesting. A layer of humanity – and  sadness – resides underneath these characters’ stories as they each  grapple with whether they can be redeemed.(Source: EW)" True text

Zack Snyder’s Justice League is simply that: Justice League, a complete, standalone film.Expect a lighter tone than BVS, which was focused on being more akin to Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, a much darker tale to begin with. Justice League is expected to be more of a fun, ensemble superhero piece that focuses on the building of the team and uniting to fight a common threat.Justice League will have a heavy Jack Kirby influence, with the story revolving around the puruit of the three motherboxes, one from Earth, one from Atlantis, and one from The Amazonians.The film takes places months after BVS, with Bruce heavily affected by Superman’s death and seeking to honor his sacrifice in building the Justice League. Rather than being a Batman on the edge, he is now a Batman full of hope, hinged entirely on created a team that can unite and fight common threats, while redeeming mankind, having learned his lessons in BVS.A large part of the film focuses on Bruce assembling the team, with Superman’s return reserved for later in the film. About his comeback, Snyder was mum, although when I asked how his hair would be, Snyder joking said it might be “a little longer” which is significant if you remember the “Death of Superman” comics.Amy Adams is back as Lois Lane.In terms of villains, Steppenwolf is one of the key villains, although not necessarily the only one. The influence and presence of Darkseid is very much alive, with the parademons we saw in BVS once again appearing here. The role of Steppenwolf is expected to be cast soon. In addition, although not confirmed, it’s implied that Lex will have something to do with this story as well. How big or how little is unknown.Ben Affleck confirmed that he is, in fact, directing a solo Batman film, but won’t begin production until the script is right, which he is currently working to get to that point.The purpose of Affleck serving as Executive Producer on Justice League is primarily to have some oversight on the Batman character as he will be directing the solo outing. This gives Affleck the ability to help steer the character and make sure everything stays in line with his next onscreen adventure.Batman’s suit will see some improvements from BVS, including armor plates underneath the costume to protect his vitals, seeing as he is the most vulnerable of the cast in terms of superpowers. In addition, we’ll see a new and improved version of his armored suit from BVS used at the end of Justice League.Bruce Wayne will build a Waynetech carrier called The Flying Fox for the Justice League to utilize. In addition, Batman will have a new vehicle called The Nightcrawler, which was designed by his father, Thomas Wayne, and plays a large role in an underground tunnel battle.Willem Dafoe’s role has been revealed as Vulko, a mentor character to Jason Momoa’s Aquaman. He’s described as being from another generation thaa Aquaman with his costume being more courtly and elaborate, including silvery, washed out colors and a lot of gil elements around the neck, with the idea being that Atlantean culture was once above water and that their skin has adapted to breathing underwater.Amber  Heard’s character, Mera, is a warrior and a sorceress, and is described as the costume designer’s favorite, with her costume having a type of chaimail blended with the skin. There’s a very elaborate fitting process with these Atlantian characters in order to make the costumes comfortable and work with the choreography of the fights, as they fit really close to their bodies, like scales.JK Simmons’ Commissioner Gordon has the classic Jim Gordon look. Simmons is wearing a hairpiece, moustache, and glasses. Ezra Miller’s Flash will feature heavily in the film and will provide much of the comic relief to the proceedings. His initial costume will be pieced together from spacesuit material, held together by electrified wire. He will rock a streamlined costume by the end of the film, designed by Waynetech.Ray Fisher’s Cyborg costume will be all CGI, while the rest of the team’s costumes will be all practical.Junkie XL will be back to score the film, although it’s unclear if collaborator Hans Zimmer will be involved. However, Zimmer’s themes will still be used regardless if he returns or not.As far as the Man of Steel himself is concerned, when (and if) we do see him, Zack Snyder stated that his hair would be “…perfect - a little longer I guess - that’s what the myths are,” which could relate to the Return of Superman storyline.[source]" True text

And I don’t mean that literally – there are villains out there who can beat Superman, obviously. It’s his limitations, his strictures, that are often the cause for his defeat. Superman unbound, Superman with everything unleashed, would be a terrifying force, and that is what Batman is scared of.Can you compare the DC universe to the Marvel universe?The Marvel universe definitely has a lighter touch. the DC universe, I think, is trying to ground itself a bit more in realism. But Marvel does the job very well and they’ve created a wonderful foundation to launch anything off. DC are now doing their thing, and building their own foundation. It’s not going to be a cookie cutter thing – it’s definitely going to work in a different way but there’s only so much I can say about that because I’m only privy to so much information.This is the your first chance to give us the classic bespectacled Clark Kent. Christopher Reeve played him as very much a disguise. What’s your take?It’s not really a disguise because, let’s face it, there’s a lot of suspension of disbelief. He’s wearing a bloody pair of glasses and you don’t just go, “Oh look! I didn’t recognise you!” It’s more two aspects of the character. Both are Superman, both are Clark Kent but Clark Kent is very much a representation of the human he would be if he decided not to become Superman. And Superman is obviously the reflection of him living up to the potential which his space dad believed he could be. Both exist within the same bubble but are separate entities.Is there a difference in the physicality of the performance?There is. Imagine someone said, in a room full of very, very short people, whatever you do, don’t stand out. And so you try and be as small as possible. And then when you get home you finally go, “I can stand up straight and be tall…” that is what Superman is. He’s the guy who’s at home who finally gets to be the being that he is.Were you a Superman kid growing up?Yes. And I’m a Superman adult [smiles].[source]" True text
