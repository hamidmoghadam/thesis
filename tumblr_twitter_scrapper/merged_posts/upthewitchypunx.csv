To break up a romantic couple, you will need:  Your altar A red apple A knife A picture of the couple (optional) A fire-safe dish (optional) When the sun sets, set up your altar the way you feel comfortable. Proceed with your usual offerings to whatever deities or elements you work with, making sure to ordain all the materials you’ll be using for the spell. Then, take the apple and your carving tool and carve the initials of each member of the couple on either side of the apple. Hold the apple in your hands and think about why you want to end their relationship, pour some emotional energy into it. Take your time with it. If you’re a vocal witch, this is also the time to say something aloud. Next, take your large knife and cut the apple in half so that the initials are separated while visualizing them splitting up. Put the apple halves aside. If you have the picture of the couple, rip in half and burn it in the fire-safe bowl in between your two apple halves. Close your spell, then bury the apple halves in earth as deep and as far apart as you can manage. You’re done!  Pst, This spell will break them up, but it won’t make them stay broken up! Try tacking on an additional love spell for one of the targets.  " False text

I’m just going to quote your submission and respond to it.I  hope this doesn’t sound offensive, but it wasn’t the cars themselves  screaming at you and running you off the road. That was the people  operating them. That does not invalidate your feelings in the least. But  maybe looking at it from a different perspective might help? I was  terrified of getting a license, and I didn’t get it until I was 26  because I was terrified of the damage I could cause by operating a car.  The people operating the cars caused the accidents, the hurtful words  thrown at you, the attempt to harm through the vehicle.Also, it’s  perfectly fine to keep not having one yet. You don’t have to do the  thing if you’re still too uncomfortable about it. When I was younger  we’d take backpacks to the grocery store when we walked, and carry the  food home that way, because we didn’t have a working car. You can still  take buses, ride a bike, whatever means of transportation you feel  comfortable with. If you’re not ready yet, then listen to that voice,  that gut feeling. I hope this helps you in some small way at least!Yes, I know it wasn’t the cars, obviously. But it was entitled American car culture and that’s the problem. It’s almost a “not all cars” argument because how am I supposed to know the good ones from the bad ones? You don’t. You just have to ride and have faith that they won’t swerve to scare you or that they know the law, like cyclists do, that in this state bicycles are allowed a full lane. Cars are a huge responsibility and I really don’t think that is understood by a lot of people. In the US it is assumed to be a given that you would have a car if you are an adult. No one stops to think about the fact that you have a 3,000-4,000 pound moving things on wheels.I have others reasons for having a car that I’m not going to discuss here, but it is nice to have a tool available and it’s not just for me We’ve had it a little over a week and have driven it twice and still walk or ride to work and still get groceries by filling our bike panniers. Be careful and share the road." True text

A lot of them appeal to my soft animism with mentioning getting to know the car and whatnot, which I totally get. However, the piece that I’m struggling with is that after being a bike commuter for the better part of 20 years, my feelings towards cars has been of ambivalence at best and antagonistic at worst. I’ve had friends’ lives ruined by cars. I’ve been yelled at, screamed at, and attempted to be run off the road by cars. I’ve always seen cars as a tool and never something I would want to be dependent on. A lot of that is because I don’t have to be as an able bodied person that lives in a place with good transit.So, while I love how close, reliant, and joyful your cars are to you, I’m dealing with some personal stuff about it. I’m having a hard time inviting it into my family, if you will. I’m even struggling with the idea of doing it  at all." True text

The folklore goes that you throw change in new cars so that you will always have change for tolls. I always keep a pinecone in the glove box. I don’t know WHY, but whenever I get a new car within a month I’ll find a friendly looking pinecone that’s just the right size to put in the glove box. Since it wants to come, I believe it’s helping. So yeah, keep an eye out for volunteer pinecones. I love this! It’s exactly the kind of thing I would do. There was already a random feather in there.

They told me how some people put sigils on their photos to prevent people from using them as taglocks for things like cursing. And I went, “well holy shit, that is fucking clever,” and proceeded to do it with every single one of my selfies I’ve posted to Tumblr. Not because I’m concerned, but I like to put faith in preventative measures.  I decided I was going to show you guys how to do it - at least with SAI, because that’s the program I tend to use for art things now (and I can’t find a good crack of Photoshop anymore). However, any art or digital media program that makes use of layers and transparencies can be used for this technique. First off, you want your sigils. I made two personal ones, and I also made two for Tumblr use. However, I’m going to recommend that you create your own sigils with your own statements of intent, if you can. “This photo is bound from being used as a taglock.”  “This photo is not successfully used as a taglock for cursing.” Ideally, you want digital sigils with transparent backgrounds, so you can avoid as much visual disturbance to your picture - you don’t want people to see or know there is anything over top of it, right? Anyway, now on to the (SAI) tutorial! Open your selfie and your sigils; you can switch between them along the bottom of the SAI window. Copy and paste the sigils onto your picture. I do this by clicking on the sigil’s canvas, hitting Ctrl+A and then Ctrl+C, then selecting the canvas with the selfie and hitting Ctrl+V. I can show the screen commands, however, for those that aren’t so tech savvy: The “paste” option is also in the “edit” menu, as you can see. When you’ve done that, your selfie should look something like this: Well, you know, you won’t look like me…but your sigils will have pasted in the top left corner of your picture. And they’re very obviously visible. BUT fortunately we’re not done with it yet.  Arrange your sigils over top of the face part of the selfie, however you want. You definitely wanna do this before you change any of the transparency of the sigils, while you can still see them. Ultimately it doesn’t matter how you arrange them, just as long as they are on your face. Mine look like this: It almost makes a heart shape, lol. So, those familar with SAI know where to look to see the layers. Mine were on the left-hand side by default, I know that is something you can change, however. They look like this: On the bottom you can see the separate layers - your picture, and the sigils each on their own layer. Above that, you can see the “mode” and “opacity” tools. Those are the ones we care about. Experiment with the mode if you want - it isn’t required, but it can help. I like to put mine on “overlay,” because it adds to the visualization of the sigils seeping into the picture and blending in to it. You need to click on each separate sigil layer to apply the mode. That makes it look like this: And with that we’re almost done! Finally, just change each of the sigil layer’s opacity to 1% by clicking on the opacity bar and dragging it almost all the way down. You want them to not be at zero because they still need to be on the pictures and not “off,” but if you put them at any higher than 1%, you can still see them, and you definitely do not want people being able to see the sigils. Once you’re done that the selfie look like this: Can you even tell there are sigils over top of that? There are. Four sigils, now, actually, lol. And this is how the layers look over on the side in SAI: As you can see, the mode has been set to overlay on both, and they are both at 1% opacity. From there, save your picture (file, save as), feeling free to specify in the title that one has been magic’d. Then, you can upload them without any worry! Of course, this can be done with sigils for other purposes - I just made this post with the intention of preventing selfies being used as taglocks, because that’s what I did to mine today. However, you can easily apply any sort of glamours to your selfies, if you desire.  I hope this helps anyone, or inspires anyone! Let me know if you have any more questions, or if I wasn’t so clear about things! This is my first time making a tutorial for any art program, I dunno if I did any good… But, yeah, just let me know if you have more questions or anything! :) " False text
upthewitchypunx 161061000898 "2017-05-25 16:07:21 GMT" http://upthewitchypunx.tumblr.com/post/161061000898/on-the-difference-between-magic-and-magick "orriculum: Par the 15-18th century, the first popular use of the definition of this word “magick” was the exact same as ‘magic’, as until after early modern English they were in fact the same word with spelling variations, similar to how we use “colour” and “color” today.   (chart demonstrates the usage/popularity of the spellings over time.)  However, this changed in the early 1900′s, as the word “magick”, was given a new definition to separate it from the general word “magic”. Magic with a “k” was a word repurposed by Aleister Crowley to separate mainstream magics, and refer to his own special brand of magic, which is used and taught in the path/tradition he started, known as Thelema. Though he has faded in popularity over the years, the word “magick” still refers specifically to Thelema practices.  He defines “magick” as “the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with the Will”. However, he goes on to explain in “Magick, Book 4”, that this means mundane actions done intentionally as well as magical ones,   “What is a Magical Operation? It may be defined as any event in nature which is brought to pass by Will. We must not exclude potato-growing or banking from our definition. Let us take a very simple example of a Magical Act: that of a man blowing his nose”, (Magick, Book 4. p. 127.) So now you know when you search or speak specifically about “magick”, you’re really looking into Thelema practices, and unless you’re doing this before the 19th century, it’s not a general vague synonymous-seeming word for magic."

I knew someone had to have done this!  I have a keychain – bought, not made – that’s an evil eye protective charm that I attached to our car key to sort of protect from road rage. My beringed has a general travel charm we take with us whenever we go on long trips. Now that I’m really thinking about it, oil changes, car washes, and inspections are obvious cleansing rituals; gassing up is an obvious recharging ritual, one you can take personal part in if you go to self-service gas stations. A bit of practical advice that could also be used as magical advice: Get a pack of baby wipes and keep it in the car to wipe down your dashboard, shit gets more dusty quicker than you’d expect it to. And, y’know, that can also be a cleansing thing. I wouldn’t visibly deface your actual card, but you could use your insurance card as a protective talisman, one that has to get reset every year when you renew your insurance. You can draw sigils into the dust when your car gets dirty. Into the frost and/or snow during winter. With the water when it rains. You could get a blank bumper sticker or car magnet and draw a sigil or something on it (I’d go for the magnet personally, bumper stickers are hell to get off without ruining the car, which is gonna hurt you if you try to re-sell it; and you can reuse a magnet). If you want something more discreet but that is still on the car, you could use nail polish that matches the paint to draw your sigil on the body – it’s a very similar enamel to what’s used as car paint, the very first nail polish actually was car paint. You could use those window markers and then just rinse the sigil off. You could get or make an antenna topper to protect you from shitty reception. You could tuck a sachet or something into the seats or attach an image to the inside of your visors. Be wary of things hanging from rearview mirrors, 99% of the time it’s not an issue, but it is technically illegal in some states and if you get pulled over by an asshole cop who’s having a bad day, he might just give you a hard time for it.  Oh, I almost forgot! My Italian-American mother always tossed change into a new car before our first official drive (the drive back from where we bought it doesn’t count) for blessings and luck. Thanks for all these! We buy these green wipes for the shop so I can just grab some of those and put them in the car, good idea. We have to leave Oregon for self-serve gas. It’s us and New Jersey that won’t let you pump your own gas! We are more on the descret side and I need to get my parents university stickers off! We also live in an area that has a lot of car break ins so anything that make it uninteresting is good." False text

I reblogged the few that were on my blog but I’m up for more! If your car has been sitting for a while before you started using it in the last few days, then you might find that it has some issues that show up in the next few months, especially since it’s pretty old. (For a car! You are an eternal spring chicken ;) The car I bought last January had been sitting for about 3 years, and we’ve had to take it in for repairs 3 times this year. Some of those things were due to the dealership we bought from doing some really shady shit (stealing the platinum out of the catalytic converter, spaying adhesive on the timing belt so it wouldn’t squeak, rather than replacing it, etc…) but some of it was from the sitting. Specifically, there was a problem with sediment in the fuel lines/tank that started to plug the lines up, which manifested in making it hard to start and a hesitation sometimes when accelerating, and a leak in the break lines that slowly got worse until one day they just stopped working.If someone’s been using the car recently, you probably won’t have any issues, though. :)But if it’s been sitting, then, basically, I’m suggesting that you consider magic to help it stay in running order, plus possibly pre-emptive money spells to put away a savings for possible repairs in the near future. Oh, it hasn’t been sitting. My parents got it 5 years ago and my mom is a school teacher so she’s been up at the cabin for summer, spring, and winter breaks and has a friend that starts it from time to time. She retired in October and has been using it as her primary vehicle until she could buy her dream Subaru. I got 6 months insurance and don’t expect it to last too long. If it breaks u can easily be car-less again. We’ve had it for a week and drove it twice. It’s mostly for grocery runs and probably for Ian B to haul band equipment to shows." False text

Me? I’ve got an amythest crystal point keychain. I’ve got a mercury dime on my postal altar at the shop and was thinking of asking it if it wanted to go on a new adventure. That’s a good idea! That’s the second suggestion for amethyst on a Keychain. It’s a good idea and a reminder not to drink and drive as it is a sober mineral." False text

The circumference defines your area of invisibility. 2. Holding the mirror so it faces away from you, turn counter-clockwise. 3. Visualize that those who look in your direction see only the mirror and hence themselves. 4. Step out of the circle: go about your business quietly with calm, smooth, minimal movement.

You already tried to tell them no but they just didn’t listen? Here’s a spell, or curse if one would like to call it that, to help finalize the end of a friendship. You will need: >Red, black, or brown candles (These colors are used for repelling things. If not, it’s all right. Candle color isn’t the most important thing.) >String (The color is unimportant.) >Two sticks or poles (That are taller than the chosen candle.) >The names of yourself and the one you want to unfriend on separate sheets of paper. -Set up two poles or sticks that can stand on their own and are taller than the candle you choose to use. -Tie the string across these two sticks, letting it be loose and dangle within range of the wick of the candle. -At one end of the string put a piece of tape or paper with your name. At the other end put your friend’s name. Designate the string as your friendship. -Light the candle and if you need to, manipulate the sticks so that the string hangs in the flame. When the string breaks, it should signify your friendship breaking. If you’d like to, you could say things along these lines: “By the burning of this string, The final bell of this time did ring. Ended now is our friendship, As the flame this string does rip.” I hope your friendships end quickly! " False text

Be extremely careful with them. Lavender, rose, and chamomile are the only ones I know of that I think you can use undiluted.  But some are dangerous. Eucalyptus, for example, can be fatal. In fact, I’d argue that most essential oils should never be used undiluted and some are just better not messed with at all outside of experienced hands. Dilute your essential oils and check what the proportions are for them. And now, because summer is coming, as a reminder, you probably shouldn’t be mixing essential oils and then sunlight. Quite a few of them react to sunlight. Specifically, here’s how citrus based essential oils react: (Yes I know part of this was made worse by the fact they went tanning up seriously citrus oils and sunlight can just in general cause chemical burns.) Also, please keep essential oils away from places where small children or pets can get at them!  Dilution means diluting them in carrier oils (a neutral scented oil like coconut, almond, avocado, grapeseed) NOT water.  Oil isn’t actually diluted by water.  Even milder oils like lavender need to be diluted.  Used long term on skin you can begin to develop reactions to your favourite oils so it’s smart to work safely with them.

I want to quote a chunk of it as brilliant examples of correcting harmful behaviors and stances, guiding people towards better empathy with the oppressed and towards more concrete and practical action to improve our world, and encourage you to click through and read the whole thing because this is just one slice of an awesome cake:(A quote of the article text by Virginia Rosenberg is below, I would use the quote function but it breaks the formatting.)“Keeping Your Vibration High:” Encouraging NumbnessEmphasizing “positive vibrations” versus “negative emotions” is another way of perpetuating oppression through distancing yourself.Beware of giving advice that stems from fear. Telling others to “be the light” when they are experiencing intense emotional reactions is destabilizing and promotes falsehood and confusion. Manipulating the feelings of others is psychologically and emotionally damaging.This type of advice robs us of personal inner sovereignty. It removes us from an authentic relationship with our inborn navigation system and prevents healing. It also renders us ineffective to deal with reality and contribute to healthy change.How to Do Better:Tell the truth. Encourage the expression of emotion, and embrace it. Be present with what arises, without attempting to control or change it.Honor anger. Anger is clarifying. Anger fuels necessary action. Anger burns like the fires of illumination. Honor sadness. Sadness is cleansing. Sadness cultivates empathy. Sadness heals our hearts and brings us together.Trust the intelligence of human emotion. Emotions contain valuable information. We need to feel it to heal it. Hold yourself and others, and be with exactly what is. This is keeping your vibration high. This is developing compassion and strength. Expressing true feelings and standing up for justice is spreading light and positivity.“Privileged Preaching:” Wielding Entitlement as The WayPrivileged people are building lifestyles on espousing “Law of Attraction“ type spiritual beliefs, and sharing them with dogmatic insistence. There is an aggressive, holier-than-thou approach that prevails in this behavior.“We create our own reality.” “Everything happens for a reason.” “What you put out is what you attract.” These are isolating, damaging, victim-blaming thoughts to distribute to people who have endured trauma or suffering as a result of societal madness and centuries-old oppression.These types of beliefs are homogenizing: they assume a shared life experience background of privilege. Having privilege is emphasized as the norm. Espousing these beliefs reinforces hegemony: keeping those with privilege in a state of dominance over others. This thinking promotes attitudes of entitlement and assumes that having privilege is the “correct” way to be.How to Do Better:Humble yourself. Realize there are many things you do not know, and many experiences you may never endure. Accept that your perspective is limited. Get informed. Get off your soapbox. Listen to others. Meet people where they are at.Recognize that it is easy to espouse spiritual perspectives when you are well-fed and watered, educated, live in a beautiful environment, your life conditions are generally peaceful and secure, and your friends and family for the most part die normal deaths (as in they aren’t systematically deprived resources or senselessly murdered). Countless people on Earth have a much different background than yours. Avoid making assumptions about others or telling others what to believe.Acknowledge that things going on in our world don’t make sense, and you don’t need to try and make sense of it. Never blame a victim for their suffering." False link
