She squeals whenever they arrive, and she cries whenever they leave. She clings to Sherlock’s leg when he’s standing, and to his neck when he’s sitting, and she pats his curls and his cheeks and says, “Shuh-la, Shuh-la.” She shares her lovey with him, a tattered and grimy bumblebee with one wing missing. Sherlock holds it and makes it fly and says, “Bum-ble-bee, bum-ble-bee,” and Rosie stares at him with huge eyes and says, “Buh-buh-bee, buh-buh-bee.” John’s heart swells each time he watches his daughter and his best friend, his Sherlock, spend time together. He stands in the kitchen and makes tea, and he watches. He sits in his chair with the newspaper, and he watches. He searches his backpack for a clean nappy, and he watches.  Mrs Hudson watches, too. She brings up biscuits and cakes and sandwiches with the crusts cut off, and she coos and fusses and invents reasons to overstay her welcome, and when she thinks Sherlock cannot hear her, she whispers to John, “You really should consider moving back, John. It would do Rosie a world of good. Look at how much she loves him. And he really shouldn’t be alone after all he went through, don’t you think?” Mrs Hudson isn’t telling John anything he hasn’t already told himself 1,000 times. When John finally broaches the subject with Sherlock he uses Mrs Hudson’s words. “It might be good for Rosie, you know? To have more than just me around? You’re really good with her and she, um, she really loves you.” Sherlock fidgets with a petri dish and does not look up. “I mean, maybe you’re happy to have the place to yourself, I don’t want to impose, or, well, anything.” Sherlock turns the glass dish around and around in his hands. “You think this would be best for Rosie, then?” John is quiet for a moment. He tells himself to get on with it. He’s a soldier, a doctor, for God’s sake. He pulls himself up and squares his shoulders. “I think it would be best for both of us. For me, and for Rosie. I’d like to come home, Sherlock.” “Home?” John has Sherlock’s full attention now. “Yeah. Home. To Baker Street. To you.” John does not look away. He licks his lower lip, and he does not look away. Sherlock nods just once. “You’re always welcome here, John. Mrs Hudson can get your room ready. You’ll need to bring the crib, but there might not be space for the changing table. Will you let your place, or sell it? You can move back as soon as you’d like. That … that would be … good. Yes.” Another curt nod. “Sherlock.” John turns to make sure Rosie is still sound asleep on the couch. “Listen. It could be different this time. The way it should’ve been. With us.” Sherlock stares and stares and stares.  “I don’t think I’m wrong that you … well, I should say … I know that I, for one … God, why is this so hard?” “What are you trying to say, John? Just say it.” “I love you, Sherlock. Always have done.” The petri dish shatters to the ground between them, and Rosie wakes up with a cry.  “What?” Sherlock says this one word alone, says it softy, says it with a sense of wonder. “I love you and I want to come home, and we can put Rosie’s things upstairs in my old room and I could, we could, if it’s okay with you … I’m sorry, I’m shite at this.” “SHU-LA!” Rosie wails. “Go. Go get your things, enough for you and Rosie to stay until you can arrange for the movers to come. I’ll stay with her. You go. Go now. Hurry.” Sherlock moves to sweep around John’s side and go to Rosie, then thinks twice and stops. “Me, too. About you, I mean.” “You do?” Sherlock steps closer, bumping their knees and shoes together. He grabs John’s wrist, squeezes. “Obviously.” “Obviously,” John mutters to himself as Sherlock scoops Rosie up and wipes her tears. “Shh, it’s okay, little bee. Daddy loves us very much, and he’s going to go get your things and come back and you’re going to stay here from now on. Would you like that?” John grabs his coat and comes to ruffle Rosie’s hair. Rosie sniffles and rests her head on Sherlock’s shoulder and nods. “Stay Shuh-la.” “Yes. Rosie and Daddy and Shu—Sherlock. Because Daddy loves us very much.” “He does,” John says, wondering how this has all happened so quickly, so seamlessly. “But he needs to go immediately so that he can come back as soon as humanly possible and move his things into Shu-la’s bedroom, right John?” “Right. On my way.” “Because Sherlock loves your daddy very much, too.” " False text

BUT. Imagine a Newtonian-level Eurus Holmes with a scope and goals beyond getting her brothers’ attention. Imagine an anti-hero, big picture, sacrifices-must-be-made-for-the-greater-good Eurus, who wants to save the world and isn’t worried about who might get hurt along the way. Imagine five year old Eurus realizing that Victor Trevor is only ever going to amount to a mid-level banker who occasionally hits his wife, but his death would push her brother to be the greatest detective the world has ever known. Hundreds, maybe thousands of lives can be saved. No brainer. Into the well he goes. Imagine 20 year old Eurus realizing that she can save the world, and all she has to do is burn it down first. She knows just how to pull the threads that will create a lasting utopia on planet earth within 100 years. Yes, 4 billion or so people will die along the way, but the earth is overcrowded anyway. She sets about her work, manipulating poor Uncle Rudy and her older brother and the idiots at Sherrinford along the way. At first her access is limited, but she learned patience at an early age. It gets lonely. She decides to seek out a little helpmeet in her adventures. She knows there is no one else in the world who can match her intellect, but she needs someone who is both smart enough to keep up with her and flexible enough to do what needs to be done. Someone who is not boring. She hopes she’s found that in Jim Moriarty, but within 20 seconds of meeting him she knows that he’s too invested in burning the world down to ever want to rebuild it again afterwards. Ample observation has confirmed that Mycroft, while more intelligent, does not possess the necessary mental and moral flexibility. A quick twitter search confirms that there are no other serious contenders - it will have to be Sherlock.  She sets her nets and she waits. Dear Jim is invaluable in this endeavor. She devises a series of trials that will teach Sherlock about the weakness of sentiment, drive him away from his pets (er…“friends”), and to make difficult decisions for the greater good. She carefully calculates the variables and concludes that once he has killed their brother, he will be ready to listen to what she has to say. She can be very persuasive. But the day arrives and Sherlock not only refuses to kill their brother, he is prepared to die for him. Eurus is wrong. WRONG. She has never been wrong in her life. If she’s wrong about this, her own brother, what else could she have miscalculated? Could she have been prepared to sacrifice 4 billion lives on incorrect data? Eurus retreats into her own mind, shattered by her failure, destined to spend the rest of her life seeking the one variable she will never understand - love. Sentiment. Amo.  THIS IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING  WOW  This is the Series 5 we deserve.  Wow, fandom will make something interesting out of Eurus yet.  This I would want to watch. Or read. Anything, really.  Dear God, keep going. Don’t stop there! If we’re going to have a madwoman in the attic, let’s have a proper 21st-century, globally-minded one.  " False text

To me, John is absolutely reminiscent of a lot of the… slightly scarier vets?  Like he absolutely is hyper vigilant Like… people only picture that as like scared and eyes darting all over the place, panicky, but … it also manifests in a much… slower… more deliberate way of looking around. Walking into a room and taking a quick scan of it to pick out the best way to escape, the most likely looking people to start trouble, mood of the room so you know if you need to play it cool. So he walks through the door, quick glare at everyone, then a forced smile as he loosens his posture and plays it cool. But the SECOND anything starts turning he isn’t remotely startled, just moves right towards that stack of beer bottles he noticed on his way in, palms it and positions himself where he needs to be in order to take someone out. When the situation cools he’s reluctant to put the bottle down, but he does it anyways. Either spends the rest of the evening hovering near the bottles or else purposely stays away from them, while being incredibly aware of how far away they are. JOhn’s the type of vet that seems pretty much to be fine, but his family will say hes secretive and more intense than he used to be.  John is the kind that stays completely calm and quiet while someone yells at him, but everything in the set of his jaw and the way he’s shifted his balance, screams out silently ‘please give me a reason, any reason, you have no idea who you’re picking a fight with’ i ADORE john but anytime i see a fic where he is nothing but sweet and understanding, all i can think is how much, to me, JOhn is playing the role of a civilian. He knows how to do it, and most people probably think he plays it flawlessly.  (((sorry mycroft, you have no idea what you’re talking about. PTSD manifests in a lot of ways, and John’s particular version isn’t even rare))   I love this and agree it is so, so John. I come from a military family and there is so much about him that I recognise.  Thank you for writing this! I know next to nothing about PTSD but I’d like to know more.  If you don’t mind me asking: What is your take on John beating Sherlock in The Lying Detective?  First paragraph is my background, skip it if you want to hear my extended John thoughts. Long as SHIT because i have STRONG feelings on the subject and I am a rambler My job included occasionally interacting with Vets in-person and make scheduling phone calls if staff was tight, but about 95% of my work was reading therapy notes, nightmare diaries, letters, incident reports, and the confidential stuff even the patients don’t get to see. Things like ‘find every single page in this 7,000 page file about their mental state as related to the X incident in X’ so i would have to ACTUALLY READ all of it, it was heavy, i had a breakdown after 3 years, etc, another worker committed suicide doing it, another went gun crazy in the building. HARD job. After all that, my level of empathy here is VERY HIGH, especially since i would follow peoples life-long recovery, so WARNING I GUESS for strong opinions about stuff In my opinion, John has a form of PTSD that is lifelong, changes the way you see the world so you have to judge everything on the basis of ‘threat’ and ‘not a threat’ and ‘potential threat’. I think he needed help, and while John hadn’t opened up to Ella after a few months home, many vets dont open up for YEARS but they still need the support system. They need to find stability and safety, and as much as i believe he loves Sherlock, sherlock’s life could only exacerbate the problem. His house might be blown up at any minute, he might be thrown in a fire, his friend might shoot guns at the wall. So John ALWAYS had a near-guarantee of eventually having an ‘episode’ The Fall was traumatizing, Mary turning out to be a Secret Threat was traumatizing, forcing himself to trust her at Sherlock’s reassurances (sherlock telling him that he’s SAFE with her, shes not a threat, shes a comrade-in-arms) and then to have her bleed out? INCREDIBLY traumatic. I know people dont like the phrase ‘trigger’ but thats the REAL WORD and it doesnt always mean ‘break into sobs’ and it doesnt always mean ‘right now’. So John, not sleeping, recently in a shoot-out again, had another comrade-in-arms die on him, Sherlock didnt come for him (he said he thought sherlock would but hadnt been interested), John is having auditory and visual hallucinations. He knows he cant trust what he’s seeing or doing, isnt safe, sends Rosie away to somewhere SAFE because he doesn’t know what he will (or wont) do. Tries to go to therapy, only for the world to crash in on him and tell him he needs to be responsible, sherlock is his responsibility. Sherlock appears to be in an altered, untrustworthy state, John trusts him anyways.  Smith is taunting him, threatening, threatening women and children and doctors and nurses, mocking them, takes them to the morgue, plays with the dead body of a woman in front of him, suddenly Sherlock appears to snap and go into his own episode, wielding a knife, no longer trustworthy John tries to disarm him, goes too far, locks into fighting, locks into his feelings of not being safe, of being surrounded by threat, having no one trust, not trusting himself, thinking ever since ghost-mary arrived that hes Not Safe And goes too far and EPISODE I know yall think that it was ‘a beating’ and ‘abusive’ but from what i’ve seen (and ive seen a LOT) ptsd vets can do some wild shit that only barely makes sense to them, even afterwards. Thats usually the sort of thing that makes them admit they need help and go to get medication and finally submit themselves to therapy, the therapy John has needed for YEARS. And they almost ALWAYS improve with it, or at least do better, even if thye never get back to ‘normal’ JOhn was left completely adrift with no support system, and honestly beating up a friend that was ALSO having a breakdown while brandishing a knife???? that shit happens so often in active warzones that John probably wouldnt even go off-duty for it.  Tensions are high and John has been taught to treat London as a war zone. Then afterwards he doesnt beg forgiveness, because he doesnt think he deserves it, doesnt say he wont ever do it again because he didnt intend to do it in the first place. He just tries to push himself away from sherlock (just like rosie, who he also doesnt feel safe with) and get help. I think when sherlock said ‘maybe we are human– even you’ i think he meant that JOhn had done well trying to hold himself together without any support for so long, and that cracks were inevitable. It is, quite literally, impossible for John to not have ptsd after all that he went through, and the fact that he held together this long is AMAZING and i do NOT judge him for losing control. His control is ALWAYS on, 100% all the time, CONCIOUS control, in martins voice ,eyes, stance, hands, and overall mannerisms. Hes HOLDING himself together. Since Day 1. HOLDING himself together, CONTROLLED, active effort, not passively ‘fine’ without trying. He goes right back to therapy days afterwards, too, he doesnt CANCEL his appointment despite ghost-mary going away and sherlocks forgiving him for irrational delusions, he still knows he needs help. And what happens?  Wow, thank you SO much! This explains so much.  The thing is, I really feel that Martin Freeman has been able to convey all that to me emotionally without me even knowing the first thing about PTSD. I am even more in awe of his acting now.  he does an AMAZING job of conveying it, thats part of what got me into it. Even if the writing, the script itself, doesnt show much evidence of PTSD, Martin jsut freaking /nails/ it, he’s super amazing. " False text

Only different. And Sherlock is just trying not to drown. How lucky am I?? I came out as high bidder for a story by @discordantwords in the excellent @fandomtrumpshate auction that is everything I wanted and so much more.  We had a great conversation about S4 and both felt that while there were lots of moments we loved, there was much that left us scratching our heads, particularly in TFP. In the end, DW decided to focus on TFP and I gave a wishlist of what I’d love to see. This gorgeous story has all that I wanted, including an exploration of what actually happened at Sherrinford (to Sherlock, John, Mycroft, Eurus, little Victor Trevor, and even the Garridebs) and in the fallout after. I wanted Mycroft. I wanted bonding with Rosie (not only with Sherlock, but also with John). I wanted Sherlock and John to have their happy ending. Most of all, I wanted declarations, of gratitude, friendship, regret, hope, and love, and I wanted our beloved characters to finally open up and be honest with one another. I got it all, in spades.  I really REALLY cannot say enough how much I love what DW has done in this story to tie together so many of the loose ends we were left with. It’s tagged a fix-it and it does, from a canon viewpoint: here, TFP is real and this is what happened during and after. It’s a beautifully written and compelling story that runs an emotional gamut from anxiety and unease and fear to healing and warmth and brotherhood and so much love. We come full circle with Sherlock as he works to make Baker Street truly home. This has left me with a much more satisfying lens through which to view TFP.  I am beyond thrilled and grateful for your time and talent and for this most stunning story, @discordantwords. Thank you!!  ::high-pitched squeeing noises::I’m so, so indescribably happy that you’re pleased with the final result. I had a lot of thoughts and feelings about S4 as a whole, but they were scattered and lacked focus. Being able to talk out what we both did and didn’t like (as well your wishlist of things you wanted to see!) gave me a target to focus in on. It was a joy to work on this story for you. Thank you again so much for bidding on me! <3 I just finished this tonight and it is an earth-movingly wonderful read.

The Hobbit star Martin Freeman is attached to star in zombie pandemic thriller Cargo from producer Kristina Ceyton (The Babadook). Bankside is launching international sales on the project in Cannes and has pre-sold UK rights to Icon Film Distribution, which had success at the local box office with The Babadook. Umbrella Entertainment will release in Australia/New Zealand. The feature is based on Yolanda Ramke and Ben Howling’s short of the same name, which clocked more than 10 million views on YouTube. Howling will direct with fellow first-time feature director Ramke, who has also written the script. Freeman, who stars alongside Benedict Cumberbatch in hit BBC series Sherlock, will play a father who, stranded in rural Australia in the aftermath of a violent pandemic and, infected himself, desperately seeks a new home for his infant child and a means to protect her from his own changing nature. Sam Jennings of Australia’s Causeway Films produces with Ceyton alongside Russell Ackerman and John Schoenfelder of LA-based Addictive Pictures. The film is set to shoot in Australia in fall 2016. Financiers include Screen Australia, South Australian Film Commission and Head Gear Films. CAA and Bankside co-represent North American rights. Bankside’s head of sales and marketing, Stephen Kelliher, said: “We are delighted to be working with the producers of The Babadook on Cargo. These filmmakers have a distinctive and elegant approach to the genre that we are certain will excite distributors and audiences worldwide.” Ceyton added: “Martin Freeman is a singular talent who will add such depth and emotional sophistication to the role, and we know will make this story come alive in an unexpected and deeply moving way.

To my mind, this fic absolutely stands up to the scrutiny, amply filling the shoes of the classic actors AU. It’s by no means a derivative or a copy, however, standing completely independent on its own considerable merits.  The author writes with authority, familiarity, and an obvious love of the New York theater world, including Broadway, musicals, plays, the Tony Awards, restaurants and other establishments, and many popular personalities from Ian Clarke and Sean Fagan to Neal Patrick Harris and Helen Mirren. This intimacy makes this an absolute pleasure and thrill to read, drawing the reader in emotionally as well as in a very nearly viscerally physical way such that it’s all but impossible to escape the pull of the floorboards and greasepaint. But brilliant as all of that is, let’s be honest: most of us are probably here for the Johnlock. And that, my friends, is absolutely incendiary. From the moment they meet, their mutual admiration and appreciation is clear to everyone, and I especially liked that the author allowed tjeor relationship to grow and mature through friendship and trust, realistically depicting the potential pitfalls of navigating a publicly scrutinized relationship, even in a segment of society as relatively accepting of homosexuality as this is. There are a couple of touches of angst as both Moriarty and Mary are allowed a chance to try and wreak their havoc, but I don’t think I’m spoiling anything by saying that in the end, no hearts are broken or burnt, and even though all the world’s a stage, these characters are not just players but as real and vivid as the affection and love they have for each other, and we for them. Truly a tour de force offering.   Seconded wholeheartedly. One of my absolute favorite fics of the year. Absolutely cannot wait for more from @blueink3." False link

When people are out of their depths when it comes to giving gifts to people, which is always, they come to me.” “ Sherlock looked down at the files in his hands once more, his eyes scanning the information written below quickly and efficiently. He knew most of it by heart now, and really, solving this problem shouldn’t be that hard. Yet, here he was, days after his client sought his help and Sherlock hadn’t found a single idea. Nothing. Usually by now he would have found the perfect solution for his client, leaving them happy and thanking him repeatedly. But Sherlock had been following the same man for four days, trying to look for clues and little things that would satisfy his duty, and honestly Sherlock was becoming a bit frustrated. John Watson, ex-army Doctor, recently invalided home after a shot in the shoulder and possessing a psychosomatic limp. Most of the time Sherlock didn’t need more information than that but this man seemed to be a complete contradiction. Sherlock couldn’t find a single reliable thing about him that could help him solve this problem. That’s why he found himself following him once again, his coat firmly buttoned around him and his hands curled around the file in his pocket. John had been taking his walk for more than a hour now, stopping from time to time in front of a shop but never once entering. Sherlock was beginning to think he should go home and try to gather more information about the time John spent in Afghanistan. Maybe the answer for his question was there. Sherlock closed his eyes, a contented sigh escaping him as he thought of the fire burning in his flat. Some warmth would be very welcome after a day like this. Sherlock was about to turn away, Baker Street wasn’t too far away after all, when two strong arms caught his. The shock of it forced him to open his eyes again only to find the same John Watson he’d been following standing right before him. “Listen mate, I don’t know, and bloody don’t care why you’ve been following me these past few days,” John growled, tightening his grip on Sherlock, “but if I see you again, I’m afraid I will be forced to do something we’ll both regret!” Thank you to @snogbox1 for her amazing job as a beta !! @johnlockandwifi @clueinglooks @johnlockadventcalendar @ishaveforsherl  Oh god, I’m sorry for letting this languish, but thank you for tagging me in this!
