Then, your teacher tells you, “Before the day of the test, make sure you get a good night’s sleep.” Sleep? Yeah, like that’s going to happen. I have an exam to stress out over! I have this one friend—one of the smartest people I know—who tends to get overwhelmed around finals week. Her go-to phrase during that time: “If I don’t pass this final, my life is over.” It’s a phrase I’ve heard millions of times, and frankly, most college students have spoken some variation of it.Well, to my fellow college students, I’m here to tell you: it isn’t over.If you pass, the sun will rise the next day—you’ll get up and move forward with your life.And if you don’t pass? The sun will rise the next day. You’ll get up. And you will move forward with your life.Your family and friends will still love you. You will keep breathing. You will be okay.You don’t have to be perfect to deserve love from others or yourself. You don’t have to be ashamed of any mistakes or supposed failures. Everybody wants to do well. So when life tosses a curve-ball, we tend to internalize what’s gone wrong—keeping the disappointment, stress, and upset to ourselves. It’s called “Duck Syndrome.” A duck appears to glide calmly across the water, while beneath the surface, it frantically, relentlessly paddles.When we fail a test or even a class, we say we are failures, instead of saying we failed. There’s a huge difference in that dialogue, and we as students (and people) need to realize that. Declaring ourselves failures says that’s all we are—which is simply untrue.We are amazing and intricately built beings, each beautiful in our own way. A number on a transcript or a test paper is just that, a number. It may seem as though that number has power, but it doesn’t. It can’t breathe. It can’t wake up in the morning with a smile on its face. It can’t decide whether you live your life or not. It is not you.So say it with me: I am not my GPA.I am not a failure." True text

Mostly big dogs, but tiny dogs are okay sometimes too (if they act like big dogs and don’t try to nibble on my toes).Why I’m here: I like to think of TWLOHA as one of those power-ups in Pac-Man. We can help turn the ghosts blue so that people can eat and get rid of them. Sometimes mental health struggles can be scary like the ghosts in Pac-Man. We want to run away, but all of a sudden we get this external boost and BAM they are no longer scary—they are dinner. It’s not a perfect analogy, but my point is: I love being able to help people help themselves.I would most likely stuff the office fridge with: CHILK. Chilk is one of the greatest things in the world. Chilk is a combination of the words: chocolate and milk. I talk about it so often I had to shorten the word to save myself some time (time I spend drinking chilk). My mom taught me it’s rude to drink and talk at the same time.Outside the office I am most likely: Trying to pet any nearby dog, surfing, and talking about how cool San Diego is to anyone who will listen. My dream BFF is: I’m lucky enough to have my “dream BFF” be the same as my real life BFF. She is such an inspiration to me. We constantly push each other to be the best, truest versions of ourselves. If you find someone who goes to your house to eat Chinese food with your parents and take your dog on walks while you’re all the way across the country, hold onto them forever. Though it would be cool to be friends with Kerry Washington from Scandal.If you could guest star on any TV show what would it be and why: Family Guy. I would like to hang out with Stewie and Brian. I feel like we would really hit it off and go on fun adventures together. Also, cartoons don’t have to worry about picking out new outfits everyday.  " True text

I have the most amazing, loving, caring, and supportive family and friends. I am a diehard Washington fan. And I love trying new and adventurous foods; sushi, burritos and pad thai bring me happiness. In addition to the 4 F’s, I love country music, traveling, and comedy. I love to make people laugh and to laugh myself.Why I’m here: Simple answer: I’m here because of my own personal dealings with depression and anxiety. The less simple answer: Following a breakup a couple years ago, my eyes opened to the stigma surrounding mental illness; I saw a girl who carved lies into her skin be denied the basic care she deserved. I’m here to fight that stigma, I’m here to be a loud voice to those who feel voiceless. I am here.I would most likely stuff the office fridge with: Donuts from Sugar Shack. Or, a caesar salad from the Sun Shoppe Cafe…there’s no in-between. If my music is on, I’m listening to: Whelp. My Spotify has a little over 1,500 songs on it (90% of those being country). Outside of the office, I am most likely: Wherever the party is at? Just kidding. I’m probably laying around watching Netflix, Skyping, or eating.My dream BFF is: I LOVE my friends—they are amazing and great but—Chris Pratt. He seems like such a genuine and chill dude while also being a superstar. If you could guest star on any TV show, what would it be and why? I was originally going to say The Walking Dead, but the confidence in my ability to stay alive during a zombie apocalypse is incredibly low. So, I would have to pick one of those Food Network shows cause I mean, come on, free baked goods. " True text

To Write Love on Her Arms has been a safe space for me to feel like I’m a part of a community that loves and accepts the light and the dark in me, and where I can accept those parts of me too. It is an honor to be a part of that movement and to be able to give back to others. I would most likely stuff the office fridge with: Pizza, avocados to make guacamole, tapioca pudding, bacon, Coke, La Croix, Chick-Fil-A, and Taco Bell.If my music is on, I’m listening to: Whatever is on my latest Spotify playlist, which ranges from Top 40 Pop to Alternative/Rock, film scores, and ambient yoga and meditation music. Some of my favorite artists are Fall Out Boy, Twenty One Pilots, Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Sia, Paramore, Panic! At the Disco, Queen, Jack’s Mannequin, Coldplay, Flume, Frank Ocean, Tove Lo, and One Republic. Outside the office, I’m most likely: Watching movies or binge watching TV shows, playing guitar, photographing something, doing yoga, sleeping, shopping, watching makeup tutorials on YouTube, trying to be an adult, singing like I’m on The Voice while doing various chores around the house, playing board games with my fellow interns, or laughing uncontrollably with my roommate, Caitlin.If you had a free plane ticket, where would you go? Fiji, so I can surf and lay on the beach forever. (First I have to learn how to surf.)What takes you out of your comfort zone? Being in a room full of people who are the opposite of me in almost every way, asking for help, most yoga poses that involve twisting, performing in front of small groups of people, and FOMO (fear of missing out)."

I applied for the internship without much expectation except to get some peace and closure, but they said “yeah we’ll have you!” I really like people, I think they’re great. I don’t like that sometimes people don’t like themselves as much as I like them and I always want to change that and make people their own biggest fan.I would most likely stuff the office fridge with: Big ol’ hearty homemade food. Currently making my way through a beast of a Shepherd’s Pie (Google it).If my music is on I’m most likely listening to: I’m recently digging anything synthy or poppy with a female vocal. My shuffle is queueing CHVRCHES, Fickle Friends, and Gwen Stefani—so there.Outside the office I am most likely: Paddleboarding, writing postcards to home, looking at tattoos I can’t afford and cats I can’t adopt, asking people ‘would you rathers’, doing Buzzfeed quizzes about the zombie apocalypse. I also do some fashion illustrating and I’m trying to read more.My dream BFF is: Aslan from the Narnia books. That would be awesome.What takes you out of your comfort zone? America. Man, it’s tough.

Thus, TWLOHA quickly found its way into my heart back in 2006. I am here, both because I want to give back to the organization that changed my life and because I desire to live my life serving and encouraging others. Furthermore, I want people to know that they are not alone, and that there is hope for everyone. I believe that we desperately need individuals in this world to share this message, and I want more than almost anything to be part of that. And last but not least, I also want to be a bridge that connects individuals from the darkest days of their struggling to the light of their healing and recovery. TWLOHA allows me the opportunity to be a piece of that bridge, while working with some of the kindest, most caring, and all around best people that I have ever had the honor of meeting.Stuff I like: Jesus. Spending time with loved ones. Hearing people’s stories/listening to people, in general. Laughter, especially until the point of crying, not being able to breathe, or when my abs become sore. Smiling. Music. TV shows. Movies. YouTube videos. Musicals. Sunsets. Sunrises. Stargazing. The beach—at night. Colors. Candles. Singing loudly in the car with friends. Pictures. Soft blankets. Going to the movies. Random and not so random acts of kindness. Words, especially inspiring words and words of affirmation. Weddings. Proposals. All things love, really. Animals. Sleep. Lights—twinkle, Christmas, chandeliers, etc. Bread. Pasta. Crushed ice.I would most likely stuff the office fridge with: Soda and microwaveable meals (in an attempt to keep myself from buying lunch).Outside the office I am most likely: Chilling in “my chair” at the Burrow watching New Girl with the other interns or watching Vlogs/other YouTube videos. Playing games with the other interns. Watching the sunset. Eating. Visiting my cats and mom. Laughing up a storm about anything and everything with my roommate, Coco.What takes you out of your comfort zone? Being in the unknown. Being in groups of people that I either do not know or am not entirely comfortable with. Being the center of attention—it’s a love/hate relationship. Confrontation.If you had a free plane ticket, where would you go? I would go to Ireland or New Zealand, because all of the pictures that I have seen have convinced me that they are pretty magical places. Or, I would go back to Iceland, because it is one of my top favorite places in the world.If you could guest star on any TV show, what would it be and why? The Ellen Show, simply because I am pretty positive that I would just laugh hysterically the entire time. And that is the dream." True text

You are everything that has ever made you cry, and you are everything that has ever made you laugh.  … You are alive right now, and I am alive right now and that fills me with such joy.”" True link

Now, you can go to this site to see a representation of the millions of online posts uploaded and shared in just one second.

Can you quietly sit and think, reflect, dream? Can you practice being “in the moment,” rather than stressing, running around, arguing, or worrying about what’s burdening you today?

Start there, and then get lost in some of the other performances from The Moth. " True link

Upon completing this epic feat, she said, “I believe that running marathons has played a large role in the fact that I am healthy today … Marathons are the best things that have happened for my body and soul.” There is hope all around us—actively search for it. Through running, writing, or whatever your unique passion may be, look for a better tomorrow and a brighter life." True link

By writing what you are mulling over and seeing your thoughts fall away and burst into stars, typing becomes a tangible way of letting go of fears, worries, and insecurities. Take some time to quiet your mind and free yourself of the many burdens you have today.   (Be sure to check out The Dawn Room, The Comfort Spot, and some of the other exercises from The Quiet Place Project!)"
