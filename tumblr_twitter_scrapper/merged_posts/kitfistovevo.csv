These diamonds, which are able to generate their own electrical current, could potentially provide a power source for thousands of years, due to the longstanding half-life of the radioactive substances they’re made from. “There are no moving parts involved, no emissions generated, and no maintenance required, just direct electricity generation,” says geochemist Tom Scott from the University of Bristol in the UK. “By encapsulating radioactive material inside diamonds, we turn a long-term problem of nuclear waste into a nuclear-powered battery and a long-term supply of clean energy.”  Continue Reading.

Moby stated that U.S. warships are being directed to the coast of Iran now, in hopes that the country will attack one and give the United States “a pretense for invasion.” Moby claimed that there are political actions afoot from conservatives to “get rid of Trump.” He explained, “He’s a drain on their fundraising and their approval ratings,” so the GOP, the Koch brothers and as other “right wing groups” are working on figuring out how to oust the President.  As well, Moby continued, U.S. intelligence agencies and those around the world are “horrified by the incompetence” of the current administration and are working to bring forward information that will lead to high level firings and impeachment.   These are all still just allegations but if they’re true then um…holy shit?
