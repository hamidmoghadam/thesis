The man who ran the store was really scary; he used to yell at me all the time, like “Don’t pick that up if you’re not going to buy it!!” I went back there for the first time in 11 years, right after the Fire era. The man wasn’t there, because he wasn’t feeling well, but his wife was running the store in his place.  In the (center or back, I can’t remember) of the store, there was a huge sticker of Jhope’s face. It was a sticker or a poster of sorts. But it was his face, with a smile on his face like this *smiles* I asked the wife, “Do you know who this is?” And she replied back with “Yes, they’re pretty cool!” It was really cool and weird.  Then these two 7 or 8 year old girls came in, and when they saw me, they started saying “Wait, aren’t you…?” I was so deep in reminiscence that I was caught off guard. I pointed at the poster, and said to the wife, “THAT’S ME!” Even though, you know, that’s Jhope, but it had “BTS” on it so I figured it wouldn’t be a big deal.  I ran outside the store, and looked back. The two girls were following me. I should’ve just smiled, and said “What’s up?” But I was so panicked for no reason, that I began to run. And you know, once you start running you can’t just stop. So I ran for 5 minutes straight. To the two ladies at ○○ Stationary, around 7 to 8 years old, if you’re watching this, I’m sorry for running away from you that day. Next time, I’ll smile and greet you.“ -Kim Namjoon " False text
