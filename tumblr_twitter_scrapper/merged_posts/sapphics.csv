The former directly enables and contributes to the latter and don’t for a moment pretend that it doesn’t. unless said lesbians want a lesbian only space to be grossly biphobic and transmisogynistic, lesbians deserve to have lesbian-only spaces. just like bisexual women have every right to make spaces for bisexual women. and just like if a lesbian or bisexual woman doesn’t need or want a space for their specific sexuality at the moment, there are sapphic/wlw spaces that any wlw can be a part of.also, being bisexual and being a lesbian are mutually exclusive. there is no overlap. i’m 100% for girls who are questioning if they have attraction to men wanting to call themselves lesbians (hell, that’s how i am after identifying as pan for 5 years!), but if a woman actively dates men (or has sex w/ men outside of a sex worker situation), she is not a lesbian."

Actually, I’m not just devastated by this. I’m pissed. I’m pissed that they threw this character for one episode, used him as a no homo, and then threw him away, when he had the potential to be so much more than that. This was a man who grew up in the same circles as Lena. Someone who probably understood how she felt growing up, at least a little. They were friends, as a matter of fact, he was probably her first friend. He was the one who was around when Lex killed all those people. He was the one who watched her already shitty life fall to pieces. He was the one that no doubt went with her to Lex’s court hearings. He was the one that probably helped her work through her childhood trauma.  Jack was important to Lena’s character. He had a huge role in her life as her friend and as more. I’m not saying I think she loved him, because I don’t think that. I think he loved her, but she just couldn’t, and yet, he still cared. He still wanted to be a part of her life. We could’ve learned so much about her through their friendship. Not to mention the way he could’ve been used with other characters in the show. He could’ve worked to help the DEO with medical advancements, specifically with Alex for some of it. Him and Winn could’ve bonded over their shared love of science. He could’ve helped Winn through his trauma. He and Kara could’ve bonded over their shared adoration of Lena. They could’ve been friends too. Jack and James could’ve bonded over shared experiences as men of color and how that affected their daily lives and business personas.  Jack Spheer was a genius, and he wanted to use his intellect to change the world. He wanted to cure cancer. He wanted to heal people. He, like Lena, only wanted to do good and was used for evil. We never got to see him react to the harm he’d caused. He could’ve been more. And the CW threw all of that away… for a quick no homo, and a half assed mourning scene for Lena that will no doubt never be mentioned again. So to reiterate, I’m beyond pissed about this, and I’m devastated at the thought of what we lost with him. " False text

After Rhea (Teri Hatcher) effectively tricked Lena (Katie McGrath) into creating a portal that would allow the surviving Daxamite race to come to Earth — err, New Daxam — Kara (Melissa Benoist) will have to turn to some unlikely allies to combat this new threat, not least of which is Cadmus leader Lillian Luthor (Brenda Strong). But just because they are aligned now doesn’t mean Cadmus has stopped hating aliens. In fact, the Daxamites won’t be Kara’s only threat as Supergirl heads into its second season finale. “There’s multiple showdowns coming up,” executive producer Andrew Kreisberg tells EW. “These are some of our biggest episodes we’ve ever done.” “The finale is probably the biggest episode we’ve ever done,” Kreisberg continues. “We saved a bunch of money to pay for more visual effects and actually added another day to the schedule so we could make it as big as possible, and yet it also has multiple get-your-Kleenex scenes. We’re really excited about it. We’re all blown away.” With villains abound, Kara will also find some help from returning familiar faces Cat Grant (Calista Flockhart) and Superman (Tyler Hoechlin), both of whom she needs “desperately because she’s faced with some truly awful decisions to make in the finale,” Kreisberg says.   Kara will need all the help she can get when Superman villain General Zod (Mark Gibbon) joins the board in the finale. “It’s a great moment,” Kreisberg says of Zod’s arrival. “We needed a big, iconic Superman villain, and there really isn’t anybody more iconic, at least in terms of a physical opponent for Superman, than Zod.”   “Say whatever you want about the finales, they’re not boring,” Kreisberg says with a laugh. “It really feels like the culmination of everything we’ve been doing all season long, all the different story lines, whether it’s Superman and Cat and Cadmus and M’Gann and Mon-El and Lynda Carter and now Rhea, it all comes together in one big two-part story.” Supergirl airs Mondays at 8 p.m. ET on The CW.

The idea came from a series of tweets stemming from a 2014 photo of the ladies sitting side-by-side at a Miu Miu show. A Twitter user captioned the photo, “Rihanna looks like she scams rich white men and Lupita is the computer smart best friend that helps plan the scams,” and the internet went wild with calls for the film to be created. “I was texting with these sisters today, and there were some interesting conversations. So we’ll see what comes,” DuVernay said Monday night during Conversations on Creativity with Questlove hosted at Pratt Institute. My twitter feed is in shambles,“ DuVernay said. “I can’t even retweet anymore. It’s so many people over the last four days inundating me with it. It just feels nice like, ‘they like me, they picked me.’” “But also, I think the main thing is the idea that the people want a certain kind of film. People want Black women in centered, powerful images that are complex and layered. And that have nuance beyond what we’re relegated to. And they want it from other Black women. They chose Black writers, with Issa. Issa text me like, ‘Yooo!’ She’s on the set of Insecure trying to be insecure.

He has the uncanny ability to take a throwaway line and turn it into a delightful one-liner. And though I’m not sure he has the emotional range of Melissa Benoist, Chyler Leigh, or Jeremy Jordan, if there were an Oscar for charisma, he would rightly be in the running for it. But Chris Wood’s inherent likability is separate from a question I’ve been asking myself about this season of Supergirl: Is Mon-El a good character? I’ve been on the fence for a while, but after watching “Distant Sun,” I’ve finally decided that the answer is no.Or rather, Mon-El is not a character worthy of as much time as Supergirl has given him this season. Supergirl has always been an ensemble series that lets different characters take prominence in different episodes, but Mon-El has gotten far more than his fair share of screentime this season. And rather than use him as a lens through which to explore Kara (a frequent role of a superhero love interest), the writers just like to focus on Mon-El full stop, especially in episodes like “Mr. & Mrs. Mxyzptlk” and “Homecoming.” He’s not only filled the hole left by Cat Grant, but sometimes pushed into the narrative place of James, Alex, and J’onn too. In fact, at times it feels like Mon-El is a co-lead of the series.I don’t think the rise of Mon-El comes from a malicious place in the writer’s room, although it does have the unfortunate side effect of centering a white male lead in a show that used to focus on women and feature an interracial relationship. If I had to make a guess as to why Mon-El has become such a focus, I would wager that after spending a whole season writing for their main ensemble, crafting stories for a new character is a much easier source of creativity for the writers. And, again, the charm Wood can bring to an episode no doubt makes the writers want to favor him as well. But his exaggerated importance this season has thrown off Supergirl’s equilibrium."
