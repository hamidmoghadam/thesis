As in the last post #1 I want to introduce you to important helpers of revitalising and documenting endangered and lesser-used languages here on tumblr. So, I will name some langblrs that deal partly or wholly with those languages. If you know more of such langblrs please tell me right away and I will mention them in a next post. Greenlandic Kalaallisut is a lesser-used language and certainly a minority language within the Danish realm. @tulunnguaq Laz language ლაზური ენა, lazuri ena, or ჭანური ენა, ç̌anuri ena is an endangered Kartvelian language spoken by 22,000 people in Turkey and Georgia that is related to Georgian.  @anadolular Chickasaw Chikashshanompa’ is a Muscogean language that is currently spoken by less than 75 people in Oklahoma. @fractalrainbow Irish Gaeilge is the national language of Ireland but only has around 74,000 mother speakers. @teangacha@chronically-chilll@seanfhocail Scottish Gaelic Gàidhlig is also a Celtic language as Irish is and is spoken in Scotland and Canada by only 57,000 mother speakers. @ambi-alba@selchieproductions@sgribhisg Cornish Kernowek is a revived Celtic language that has gained some new mother speakers again. @fortheloveoflanguistics (Also about language revitalisation in general) Sami languages Saami languages are Uralic languages, related to Finnish and Estonian, and are spoken by around 30,000 mother speakers. @selchieproductions (Southern Swedish Saami)@fara-learns-sami (Northern Saami) I really hope that this will inspire more of you to submit other blogs that deal with a certain endangered, lesser-used or minority/regional language or with language endangerment and revitalisation in general. The network and possibilities of tumblr are such good resources for languages that have hardly any visibility elsewhere and especially no resources to learn with. So, let’s spread this message further, so I will get more submission of endangered langblrs to share with you. Thanks a lot!  Thank you for adding me! Once I get done with Uni next week there’ll be a lot more endangered languages/linguistics content coming up, with one or two especially big announcements! :D  " False text

They worry about thoughtcrime and facecrimes. To these characters, standard English is known as Oldspeak. These words exemplify a trope in science fiction literature in which an imagined future is made more vivid through the creation of closed compound words. Words like cyberspace, which first appeared in the science fiction of William Gibson, were birthed in this fashion. This trope is effective and widespread in the genre because it echoes the actual linguistic phenomenon whereby compound words meld together. Compound words tend to start their linguistic lives as open compounds (with a space between the elements) or hyphenated compounds (with a hyphen between the elements). Many grow closer over time, gradually and naturally losing the space or dropping the hyphen as users grow more familiar with seeing those word pairs side-by-side. As dictionary editors, we monitor such changes in usage. If a new form gains traction, appearing in a wide variety of print sources, we’ll make a change to the way we enter the word in the American Heritage Dictionary. Such changes, made initially to the headword, can ripple across dozens of other entries, as we revise the word not only in its own entry, but in every definition it’s used in; the result is a cascade of revisions, some more extensive than others, depending on how common the revised word is throughout the dictionary. In the last several years alone, words such as byplay, hardfisted, email, lowball, and spacetime have joined the ranks of formerly-hyphenated compounds, while the main entries daybed, glassblowing, milkshake, and steakhouse have dropped the spaces between their two elements. The results of these mergers are known as closed compounds. Words like teenager and offstage, now naturally joined, once appeared regularly as disparate elements. If you’re ever confused as to whether a particular compound should be hyphenated, open, or closed, there’s a good chance the answer is a matter of preference. While teen-ager may look awkward now (we only enter the closed form), there was a time when you were just as likely to encounter the word with a hyphen as without. When a word is transitioning from open to closed, many compounds remain acceptable in multiple forms. In these cases, we enter the most common form first, followed by its variants. For some words, this transition can take quite a long time. Take a look at the development of the word sunset. Its earliest citation in the O.E.D., in 1390, is as an open compound, “Sonne set.” The citations then vacillate between hyphenated and open throughout the 1400s and 1500s; by the 1800s, the word seems to have settled in its closed form, sunset.

Early in her career at the  University of Rochester, the assistant professor of brain and cognitive sciences began studying primates in her search for the origins of numeric understanding. In 2013, she, PhD candidate Steve Ferrigno, and colleagues at  Rochester and the Seneca Park Zoo made a surprising discovery: in an  experiment using varying quantities of peanuts, baboons (even as young  as one year of age) clearly showed an ability to distinguish between  large and small quantities of objects. But the finding raised another question. To what extent might that  ability be influenced by other dimensions of those objects—such as their  relative surface area—in addition to their number? Cantlon, Ferrigno, and two additional coauthors—Steven  Piantadosi, an assistant professor of brain and cognitive sciences at  Rochester, and Julian Jara-Ettinger, a postdoctoral researcher in brain  and cognitive sciences at MIT—published the results of a new study  suggesting that primates do, in fact, have the ability to distinguish  large and small quantities of objects, irrespective of the surface area  they appear to occupy. Study subjects included both humans and primates: adults and children  in the United States; adults of the Tsimane’, a predominately “low  numeracy” cultural group that inhabits an area of remote rain forest in  Bolivia, and that has been long studied by Piantadosi and Jara-Ettinger;  and rhesus monkeys, a species with strong neural and cognitive  similarities to humans. The researchers found that all groups showed a bias toward numbers over surface area in their estimations. “This shows that the spontaneous aspect of extracting numerical  information likely has an evolutionary basis, because this has been seen  across all humans and also with other primate species,” said Ferrigno. The study also showed that the bias toward the numerical dimension  was strongest in humans compared to primates, and was correlated with  increasing age and math education in humans. “As children get older, they are more likely to represent numerical  information as opposed to other quantitative information,” Ferrigno  added. “Similarly, when Tsimane’ adults had more math education, they  were more likely to represent numbers as opposed to other dimensions.” The study, published in Nature Communications, is an  exciting development for anyone interested in improving early math  education. Because the testing process was nonverbal, it could be  especially useful in assessing math abilities in young children. “It’s  very hard to test young children at age four on their math abilities  because it’s hard to differentiate what they know, and what they know,  but just can’t express,” Ferrigno said. “With further refinements, this  type of numerical bias test could in the future be an indicator of how  they are progressing in their education.” The study is the first to compare number perception with a single task performed across a diverse testing population. To test the relative importance of numerical quantities versus  surface area, researchers presented subjects with dot arrays, varying in  both the number of dots and the relative surface area they occupied.  For each array the subjects then selected one of two icons to categorize  the array as a large or small quantity. To keep the task the same across groups, no verbal description of the  categories was provided; instead, subjects learned from nonverbal  demonstration by the experimenters, and trial and error feedback. The tests with primates and children and adults in the United States  were conducted with touch screen monitors; Tsimane’ adults, who have  limited exposure to such devices, were tested with laminated printouts. Cantlon says the study shows “that the initial step toward becoming  mathematically sophisticated likely had to do with focusing in on the  number of objects, not just total mass or size.” In a broader sense, she  adds, it shows “how humans got to be the way they are. “This is about understanding human origins and how humans evolved thought processes that are mathematically sophisticated.” " False text

Tl;dr: if you only know of a handful of particular endangered languages, odds are that they are actually among the largest and most vital endangered languages out there. Most will be doing worse. There are, in usual ballpark figures, around 6000 languages in the world, and around 7 billion people in the world. So by simple math we could suspect that the average language has maybe about a million speakers. And if 90% of the world’s languages are endangered, does this mean that any language that has under than maybe 10 million speakers is endangered? Wrong. Languages sizes by speakers are not a flat distribution, but closer to an exponential distribution. In the mean case you indeed get a million speakers per language, but the median case is far less. Suppose that Brutopia has ten million people; of which 99% speak Brutopian as their first language, while the remaining are nine ethnic minorities of about 11000 people each. Then “on average” a language spoken in Brutopia “has” one million speakers. But the median case is the latter group: there is only one Brutopian, versus nine minority languages! The actual fifth-most spoken language in Brutopia does not have one million speakers: it only has about ten thousand. The “90%” of the world’s languages that are endangered and in risk of going extinct within a century are cases exactly like this. Some thousands of speakers strong at best, not millions, spoken only by a vanishing minority of the world’s population. [from Wikimedia] Meanwhile roughly one-million strong languages can already reach into the teal central category (e.g. Dzonkha, Estonian, Mandingo), and mostly they are in the blue. You can even find occasional “teal” languages one entire order of magnitude smaller than this, at a mere ~100,000 speakers; e.g. Tongan. If we were to look at the US in particular, the pattern again runs exactly like this. 80% of the people have English as their first language; followed by a whole host of languages spoken by various immigrant groups, starting with Spanish and continuing with Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, French… The first native language to turn up is Navajo, way down the list at no more than ~170,000 current speakers. Or, since the US as a population of about 320,000,000, around 0,05%. And Navajo is not even considered an endangered language, strictly speaking. Merely “vulnerable”. It’s a tiny minority language whose future is precarious, for sure, but when we speak of a language going “endangered” in linguistics, we have a direr situation yet in mind. Guess how many speakers the second-most spoken native language in the US has? Even by liberally lumping related dialects together into single languages, we can only get up to 20,000 (a rough tie between between Sioux and Yupik). Yes, nearly ten times less than Navajo already. And the vast majority by count of Native American languages in the US do not reach even quintuple digits. Aleut, Blackfoot, Cheyenne, Comanche, Dena’ina… these and dozens of others are all closer to a mere one thousand speakers, indeed perhaps fewer than 100. Still, even these numbers do not mean that a language would be terminally endangered and bound to disappear if you as much as blink. Most of the world’s languages probably never had more than a handful of thousand speakers over the majority of their histories. Remember that world population has grown ten-fold over the last 250 years, and also ten-fold over the 500 years before that. With adequate support and respect, a language community could rebounce even from near extinction, and already a speaker-base of a couple hundred speakers could in principle allow a language to survive as long as there is will. The potential methods for doing any of this, though, would be a whole different post yet.  Speaker population size is a crude measure. It can give us a good first impression, but not more. Sure, any language with <100 speakers is most likely not stable, and anything with less than 10 is definitely moribund, but we know that languages can be “vital” over long periods of times even with constantly <10000 or even <2000 speakers. Most Aboriginal Australian languages never in their history had five-figure speaker communities and they had been stable until the European invasion in the 18th century. Many “small” languages are doing just fine with <500 speakers, which is basically just one village.  The point is: if that village is left in peace, the language is not in danger. It is political, economical, social factors that put pressure on these language. Even a language with tens of millions of speakers can be in danger if its speakers come to believe that their language is “useless” and should not be transmitted to the next generations.  Ceterum censeo: we need better criteria to assess language endangerment.  Indeed. Several simple further criteria can be wrenched from language use: is a language used by families at home? in schools? in workplaces and stores? in the media? in higher education? Most importantly, what about the “competing” languages? It’s possible for languages to coexist in different environments (say, medieval to early modern Latin as solely the language of the Catholic church and of higher education), but an ongoing trend of a majority language displacing a minority language from a growing number of environments is usually bad news. FWIW one of my professors has been working on a pilot study team aiming for a better metric of endangerment: the European Language Vitality Barometer. (This is, alas, unlikely to generalize all over the world.) " False text

There is also a more fundamental relationship between gestures and thinking, a relationship that is possibly even more primary for gesture than that with speech. Earlier this year a Sotaro Kita, Martha W. Alibali and Mingyuan Chu published a paper that brings together a lot of excellent research to discuss the role that gesture  has in thinking and speaking. As Kita tweeted when it was was published in January, this paper brings together 20 years of research and 10 years of writing. The authors draw on an extensive background literature, which includes their own extensive and excellent research (you may remember Kita’s work from the ‘Blind people gesture’ post, and Alibali’s work featured in an earlier post about unhelpful gesturing). If you only read one survey paper on the relationship between gesture and language, this is certainly a good one. But reading papers about gesture is my day job, not yours, so I’ve summarised some of the good bits for you. Introducing the ‘Gesture-for-Conceptualisation’ model In this paper the authors argue that the main function of gesture is to help the speaker conceptualise what they are thinking about, and therefore going to speak about. The authors argue that gestures are “physical actions of a special type” (p. 1), which means that gesturing about moving a mug of coffee is linked to the action of moving coffee as much as it is talking about moving the coffee, and that makes gestures particularly important in conceptualising tasks, and also talking about them.  They argues that there are four main ways gesture affects cognition to help conceputalise thought: (1) activation, (2) manipulation, (3) packaging and (4) exploration. All may occur in the one gesture, or one function may be more dominant at a particular time. I’ll go through each of these briefly. I often talk about the relationship between language and gesture being very close, so at the end I’ll also look at what the authors say about why gesture is at an earlier stage of cognition than spoken language might be.   Gesture activates cognition: Gesturing while thinking silently   The authors present evidence from experiments that show people gesture when  thinking about problems, even if they are not speaking and are by  themselves, and that these gestures can help people perform better certain kinds of  mental tasks that involve thinking about the manipulation of real or imaginary objects. Being allowed to gesture means people in experiments tend to think out  solutions to problems using more space and movement, people who aren’t  allowed to gesture tend to use more abstract ways of talking through the  problem. This means that gesture plays a more central role in cognition than just being linked to one other cognitive skill, like language or problem-solving, which is how it has been discussed in earlier work.  The authors argue that gesture can help with cognition because it represents information about objects and their manipulation in a more “schematic” way than other cognitive processes, stripping out a lot of potentially unnecessary detail.  Gesture manipulates cognition: People gesture more while dealing with complex spatial/motion information Not only do people gesture more in these tasks, but in one set of experiments people who performed more gestures do better in later attempts at the task, even when they’re told not to gesture on the second attempt - indicating there is some ongoing benefit to cognition, manipulating their cognitive skills at the task.  Gesture packages cognition: Changing the way people gesture changes their language Gesture can package information about space and movement. In one experiment researchers used this to manipulate how people used language to discuss an event. By asking the participants to gesture about specific features of the event, they could also shift the language that the speakers used. Also, the more information that there is to be packaged up into speech in a task, the more gestures people tended to use, to help them package up all that information.  Gesture explores cognition: Trying out ideas before you even say them There have been a number of studies that show that when people are learning about a new concept (particularly school-age children), there is a phase where there is a ‘mismatch’ between what they’re talking about and their gesture. For example when a young child sees water from a tall, narrow glass poured into a wider glass, the child will often say there is less water in the second glass, because the level is lower. If the child makes a hand-spreading gesture while saying this though, it is an indication that the child is beginning to understand that there’s actually the same volume of water, held in a different shape. Difficult  tasks can lead to a speech/gesture mismatch, which the authors argue is the brain trying out ideas  that aren’t expressed in speech. They also suggest that half-finished gestures may be an indication that the brain is abandoning ideas,  indicating unsuccessful exploration. My favourite quote from this part of the paper: “The key features of these phenomena are that the microgenesis of ideas in gesture is, to some extent, independent from (and blazing the trail for) the microgenesis of ideas in speech, and that ideas develop in gesture via a process of trial and error” (p. 9) Gesture is linked to other ‘practical actions’ The authors argue that gestures share features in common with other practical actions that we do with our hands and other parts of the body. They make a number of observations on this point:  People gesture more when talking/thinking about things that involve movement Gesture rates also affected by how easy it would be to manipulate the objects being gestured about. In their example a picture of a spiky mug propted fewer gestures in a rotation task than a smooth mug (because who the heck would want to touch an ouchy mug?) If people have experience manipulating the object being discussed then they gesture about it more But, they note that there are some extra things that gestures can do for cognition that actions don’t. Firstly, because gestures have this ‘schematising’ function, they have a stronger influence on thought and they’re better for making generalisation while making relevant information more flexible and efficient. Secondly the authors argue that gestures can affect through more strongly than actions. In a map recollection task people who gestured to remember the route did better than people who drew it. They also discussed research on expert users of abacuses, who calculate faster with an imaginary abacus BECAUSE REAL ONES SLOW THEM DOWN TOO MUCH . Kita, Alibali and Chu didn’t write that all in capitals, but I’m still blown away by the idea that reality is holding back calculation.  They do note that it’s possible that sometimes schematic representations in gesture may not have the relevant information, or be distracting, but setting up an experiment to confirm this would be difficult.  But Lauren, don’t you always say that gesture and speech are closely linked??? I do, and they are. Kita, Alibali and Chu discuss this too: “We argue that this occurs because the action generation system and the speech production system are highly interactive. As proposed by Kita and Özyürek (2003), the two systems can exchange information and align their contents. Thus, the contents of concurrent gesture and speech tend to converge.” (p. 11) That is, gesture and speech are very closely related, but before that gesture and thought are very very closely related, and because speech is also linked to thought, it all tends to come together so quickly that it’s taken them decades of experiments to start pulling these relationships apart.  They also discuss how their model fits with some other research that looks at the relationship between gesture and language. For example, it’s been observed that gesture helps with retrieving words when you can’t quite remember them. The authors of this paper argue that this fits with their model, because the ‘activation’ function of gesture can retrieve a representation of an item or a feature of it, which then activates associated information such as the name for it. There has been a great deal of research that indicates that gestures are useful for the people that we are speaking to, not just our own thinking. The authors of this paper don’t deny that that may be the case, instead arguing that it is possible for gestures to be both self-oriented and have a communicative function. Indeed, the schematisation that is beneficial for the speaker’s cognition may also be what is so useful about them for an interlocutor. They also argue that this still works for objects that we have no direct experience interacting with, because we are also able to navigate a  “virtual environment” of experiences.  One final great quote from the paper that sums it all up “By schematizing spatio-motoric information for these four functions, activation, manipulation, packaging and exploration, gesture facilitates cognitive processing and generates novel ideas, strategies and solutions that are easy to process, adaptable, and generalizable.” (p. 14) Reference: Kita, S., Alibali, M. W., & Chu, M. (2017, February 27). How Do  Gestures Influence Thinking and Speaking? The  Gesture-for-Conceptualization Hypothesis. Psychological Review.

This is the year 2017 and I’m still having to yell about how ridiculous Maya extinction myths are and tell people we are ‘Maya’ not ‘Mayan’. I’m not saying shame shame if anyone reads this and didn’t know. I’m so angry concerning how slowly these issues are being picked up by educational institutions, at how often I have to bring these things up to higher education professors. We are a massive massive group of peoples. One of the largest Indigenous groups in the Americas. Wikipedia cites 7 million or so of us total but honestly that’s way off because that’s about how many Maya folks there are in Guatemala alone. We’re not dead. The Maya did not ‘mysteriously disappear’. We did not ‘fall’. We did not fade into obscurity. We’ve led revolts and rebellions against colonial powers for hundreds of years. We’ve had a big hand in shaping legislative definitions and protections for Indigenous Peoples in Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, and El Salvador. We haven’t lost our cultures. We’re constantly threatened and experience a lot of violence and have our resources stolen but we are still very much alive and our cultures have persisted. And don’t even try me with the whole “Oh well we mean your CIVILIZATION disappeared, not you.” The structure of our societies and layout of our network changed and decentralized in many areas. That didn’t make us turn invisible. That didn’t make us not still be large in numbers with a relationship with our lands and lose influence in the areas we live. We still held power in large cities way after what people like to cite as “the fall of the Maya Civilization” (around 600-900 A.D. when we still had cities that we held power of until nearly 1700 when the last was “conquered” by Spain.) Which brings me to the next issue. Being “conquered” or having a colonial government installed does not erase Indigenous societies or civilizations. That’s an extremely eurocentric way of thinking. We didn’t suddenly turn into Spaniards. We still had massive amounts of towns and villages with leaders. We still had our cultures, our trade, our networks, our influence, while Spain focused on putting up flags in our cities. So yeah. All your history books have you all convinced that an extremely large group of people, with a greater population than more than half of the countries in Europe, all died out 1100 years ago. Now try to imagine what kind of shit Indigenous Peoples with much less numbers and much lower access to resources go through. " False text

My experience is primarily coming from a Linguistic perspective, though the practice is used in psychology. This post is largely about CDA rather than other forms Discourse Analysis. I have linked my sources in the inter-text citations- if any of the links do not work, please let me know.  Ahead of time: This article has discussions of the Hillsborough Disaster. If you are upset by descriptions of crushing or death, please give this a miss.   What is Discourse? The word discourse is thrown around tumblr a fair bit, often using the first result that appears on google of “written or spoken communication or debate.“ (OED, 2017)  This is a fair definition for daily use of discourse, but for the purposes of this post, I’ll be using this definition, that discourse is  (1) In linguistics, discourse refers to a unit of language longer than a single sentence.(2) More broadly, discourse is the use of spoken or written language in a social context. (Nordquist, 2017) In short, discourse is language, written or spoken. Discourse Analysis studies how the language is used. Critical Discourse Analysis studies the use of language in relation to the reproduction of dominance structures.  What is Critical Discourse Analysis? As above, Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) studies how language can be used to reproduce and enforce dominance structures, though it can be used to examine language of rebellion against powerful classes. Largely, CDA studies top-down power structures, whether they are overt such as orders, or covert, such as diminishing or hiding those structures. (Van Dijk, 1993).  Dominance structures favour particular classes (eg. white people, abled people, men, ect.), often in the form of ‘common sense’ writings. Common sense, in this case, tends to be thoughts or structures that are repeated as well-known truths, but often favour those in power or will attack the ‘other’. An example would be rehabilitation programs- it is ‘common sense’ that those who do petty crimes (robbery, drug use) should be taught the error of their ways so they can reintegrate into society. However, this does not address underlying societal problems that lead to petty crimes. As such, CDA cannot take ‘common sense’ for granted.  What are common areas to use Critical Discourse Analysis? One can apply CDA to any piece of discourse, from novels to newspapers. In my experience, however, it is particularly worthwhile to use CDA on newspapers and political discourse. This doesn’t mean you have to write an essay on every single article- but it can be useful to look at a paper and ask “where is this coming from, and what is it trying to say?”  [Image: The front paper of The Sun newspaper. The headline is ‘The Truth’ in all capital letters. It has bullet points stating “Some fans picket the pockets of victims”, “some fans urinated on the brave cops”, “some fans beat up PC giving kiss of life.”]  (The Sun, 1989) (trigger warning for death, crushing) For some context: The Hillsborough disaster occurred in 1989 when officer   David Duckenfield ordered the turnstiles to an already crowded pen to be opened. This caused a human crush in which 98 people died of their injuries. To escape the crush, fans rushed onto the pitch.  At the time, the Sun’s headline shows that it sides with the police. The police are “brave” and “giving the kiss of life” whereas ‘some fans’ pick pockets, urinate on people and beat up the police. The article itself was more balanced, according to the original writer, but the headline did the damage. Fans were blamed for Hillsborough for years.  This paper pushes the view that the police, a powerful institution are the brave helpers. They are the ones who are heroic, reinforcing their power. However, in this particular story, the police caused the problem. There was a huge turn-out to the game, and rather than directing fans elsewhere, the police put them into an already overcrowded area. Directly leading to 98 deaths. And then blaming the fans for it.  The Sun chose to reinforce power structures and sell papers rather than, ironically, tell the truth. This is CDA in action. It was not until recently that South Yorkshire’s Police Force failings were recognised- they caused Hillsborough. Not the fans.  One should always be critical of sources, and CDA is an excellent way to examine power structures and how they are reproduced.  Conclusion This is a very beginners introduction to Critical Discourse Analysis, but I have hopefully covered a few principles. CDA is useful for identifying how power structures are reproduced linguistically, and I highly encourage people to look up Van Dijk’s paper on the Principles of Critical Discourse Analysis- it’s very useful for looking at sources in our times of ‘fake news’. It examines where someone is coming from, what they are trying to do, and how it is reproduced.  Thanks for reading.  Lu.  " False text

But Wikipedia didn’t say how this schwa originated, and I wanted to know. The sources Wikipedia cited were all in Italian and the one English source was very general. I wasn’t able to find any sources of the phonological history of Piedmontese via Google, either. So, I decided to apply a bit of the comparative method myself to find out where this Piedmontese schwa came from. From Wikipedia, “Piedmontese language”: Pmnt vënner, It venerdi, L veneris diēs From Wikipedia, “Romance languages”: Pmnt vëdde, It vedere, L vīdēre Pmnt sëcca, It secca, L sicca  From The Global Lexicostatistical Database: (This source claims that the orthographic double consonants in Piedmontese are not phonologically geminated, but I don’t believe it) Pmnt sënner, It cenere, L cinerem Pmnt pëss, It pesce, L piscis  Pmnt cël, It quello, L ecce illu and eccu illu respectively From the Piedmontese Wiktionary test project: (There are certainly more than this but I only had the energy to look through the entries for A to D) (There were also a couple entries here that listed the pronunciation as lacking actual gemination, but…I’m going on the assumption that even if modern varieties lack it, the orthographic doubling indicates the presence of historical phonological gemination.) Pmnt bëscheuit, It biscotto, L biscoctum  Pmnt bachëtta, It bacchetta  Pmnt acutëssa, It acutezza  Pmnt chërse, It crescere, L crēscere  Pmnt chërpo, It carpine, L carpinus  Pmnt chërdo, It credo, L credo (fascinatingly, the Piedmontese cognate does not mean “creed”. It means “moment”, “interval”, or “instant”, and the religious terms àmen and ave have gone through the same semantic shift, perhaps in reference to the amount of time needed to say a creed, or an “amen” or an “ave”) Pmnt chërde, It credere, L crēdere  Pmnt carëssé, It accarezzare  Pmnt cëttì, It zittire  Pmnt crëstà, It crestato, L cristatus  Pmnt cravëtta , It capretta, L *caprittam  Pmnt dësgreghé, It disgregare, L disgregāre  Pmnt ëd, It di, L dē  Whew! Okay, so as you can see, a few terms don’t have Latin ancestors, either because I couldn’t find them, or because as far as I can tell the morphology involved in the Italian and Piedmontese cognates had never been productive with the ancestral root word in Latin. So, firstly, it seems that a lot of Piedmontese /ə/ came from unstressed long or short /e/ or /i/ in particles (cël, ëd) - initially I thought this applied to vowels in derivational affixes like dës- and -ëssa but then I realized that those affixes and their Italian/Latin equivalents are stressed, so the stress explanation couldn’t work for those. Secondly, it seems that Wikipedia’s claim that “The double consonants of Piedmontese exist only after stressed /ə/, written ë, and are not etymological” is not only not always true but actually somewhat backwards. It appears that many instances of Piedmontese /ə/ are actually caused by geminates, either original or developing later in Romance, as in L sicca > Pmnt sëcca, L   -ittam > Pmnt -ëtta, L -itiam > Pmnt -ëssa, or L piscis > Pmnt pëss. Thirdly, it seems that, beyond geminates, Piedmontese /ə/ comes from Latin short or long /e/ or /i/ before consonant clusters in general, e.g. L crestatus > Pmnt crëstà, L disgregāre > Pmnt dësgreghé, L biscoctum > Pmnt bëscheuit, or L crēdere > chërde. However, there are still some instances of Piedmontese /ə/ in this sample that cannot be readily explained, such as sënner, vëdde, and vënner. In these examples, neither /ə/ not the geminate is etymological. It would be simpler to assume that the geminate triggered the shift from a front vowel to schwa, as in the other cases, but that leaves unexplained where the geminate comes from. Nonetheless, I propose that the geminate consonants in these examples predated and caused /ə/. Further research may elucidate the origin of the geminate consonants in these words. Another change notable in this sample of words is a KreC > KerC shift (with “C” standing for any consonant) as seen in L crēdere > Pmnt chërde, L credo > Pmnt chërdo, L crēscere > Pmnt chërse, and L *caprittam > Pmnt cravëtta. The schwa in chërpo may be an analogical development, resulting not only from the resemblance of chërpo (“common hornbeam”) to KerC-shifted words, but also from the fact that it is also a botanical term like cravëtta (which refers not only to a young female goat but to several species of mushrooms); likewise, chërse (“to grow”) is also closely associated with plants. This KreC > KerC shift may allow us to date the approximate occurrence of the front vowel > schwa shift, or at least put it in its place in the ordered sequence of sound changes between Latin and Piedmontese. As seen in the examples of crēdere > chërde and credo > chërdo, the KreC > KerC shift could not have happened before the palatalization of Latin /k/; if it had, the Piedmontese reflexes of crēdere and credo would begin with /tʃ/. The alternative explanation - that /e/ shifted to /ə/ before the palatalization of Latin /k/ - is not only implausible on account of how extremely early it would place the /e/ > /ə/ shift, but also due to the fact that such a shift would have no clear explanation. Placing the KreC > KerC shift after the palatalization of /k/ and before the front vowel > schwa shift provides a clear explanation of both the preservation of /k/ and the shift of /e/ to /ə/, as the KerC-shifted outcomes of crēdere and credo contain a consonant cluster /rd/, and consonant clusters are shown in other words to trigger the shift of front vowels to schwa. In conclusion, by comparing a small sample of Piedmontese words to their Latin ancestors and Italian cognates, we can see that Latin /i/ and /e/ shifted to /ə/ in Piedmontese under two different conditions: in unstressed particles, and before consonant clusters, including geminate consonants. The shift of /i/ and /e/ to /ə/ under the latter condition occurred after a KreC > KerC shift, which in turn occurred after the palatalization of Latin /k/ before front vowels. Wow! Okay, that turned out way longer than originally planned. What’s funny is that I’m doing this “original research”, but probably these sound changes (assuming they’re even accurate) have already been discovered and described in published literature by one or more Italian scholars and I’m just unaware of it. Sometime I should actually undertake a serious search for physical-book sources on Piedmontese, whether in English or Italian, so I can find out for real whether these changes have already been described or not.

There is also a more fundamental relationship between gestures and thinking, a relationship that is possibly even more primary for gesture than that with speech. Earlier this year a Sotaro Kita, Martha W. Alibali and Mingyuan Chu published a paper that brings together a lot of excellent research to discuss the role that gesture  has in thinking and speaking. As Kita tweeted when it was was published in January, this paper brings together 20 years of research and 10 years of writing. The authors draw on an extensive background literature, which includes their own extensive and excellent research (you may remember Kita’s work from the ‘Blind people gesture’ post, and Alibali’s work featured in an earlier post about unhelpful gesturing). If you only read one survey paper on the relationship between gesture and language, this is certainly a good one. But reading papers about gesture is my day job, not yours, so I’ve summarised some of the good bits for you. Introducing the ‘Gesture-for-Conceptualisation’ model In this paper the authors argue that the main function of gesture is to help the speaker conceptualise what they are thinking about, and therefore going to speak about. The authors argue that gestures are “physical actions of a special type” (p. 1), which means that gesturing about moving a mug of coffee is linked to the action of moving coffee as much as it is talking about moving the coffee, and that makes gestures particularly important in conceptualising tasks, and also talking about them.  They argues that there are four main ways gesture affects cognition to help conceputalise thought: (1) activation, (2) manipulation, (3) packaging and (4) exploration. All may occur in the one gesture, or one function may be more dominant at a particular time. I’ll go through each of these briefly. I often talk about the relationship between language and gesture being very close, so at the end I’ll also look at what the authors say about why gesture is at an earlier stage of cognition than spoken language might be.   Gesture activates cognition: Gesturing while thinking silently   The authors present evidence from experiments that show people gesture when  thinking about problems, even if they are not speaking and are by  themselves, and that these gestures can help people perform better certain kinds of  mental tasks that involve thinking about the manipulation of real or imaginary objects. Being allowed to gesture means people in experiments tend to think out  solutions to problems using more space and movement, people who aren’t  allowed to gesture tend to use more abstract ways of talking through the  problem. This means that gesture plays a more central role in cognition than just being linked to one other cognitive skill, like language or problem-solving, which is how it has been discussed in earlier work.  The authors argue that gesture can help with cognition because it represents information about objects and their manipulation in a more “schematic” way than other cognitive processes, stripping out a lot of potentially unnecessary detail.  Gesture manipulates cognition: People gesture more while dealing with complex spatial/motion information Not only do people gesture more in these tasks, but in one set of experiments people who performed more gestures do better in later attempts at the task, even when they’re told not to gesture on the second attempt - indicating there is some ongoing benefit to cognition, manipulating their cognitive skills at the task.  Gesture packages cognition: Changing the way people gesture changes their language Gesture can package information about space and movement. In one experiment researchers used this to manipulate how people used language to discuss an event. By asking the participants to gesture about specific features of the event, they could also shift the language that the speakers used. Also, the more information that there is to be packaged up into speech in a task, the more gestures people tended to use, to help them package up all that information.  Gesture explores cognition: Trying out ideas before you even say them There have been a number of studies that show that when people are learning about a new concept (particularly school-age children), there is a phase where there is a ‘mismatch’ between what they’re talking about and their gesture. For example when a young child sees water from a tall, narrow glass poured into a wider glass, the child will often say there is less water in the second glass, because the level is lower. If the child makes a hand-spreading gesture while saying this though, it is an indication that the child is beginning to understand that there’s actually the same volume of water, held in a different shape. Difficult  tasks can lead to a speech/gesture mismatch, which the authors argue is the brain trying out ideas  that aren’t expressed in speech. They also suggest that half-finished gestures may be an indication that the brain is abandoning ideas,  indicating unsuccessful exploration. My favourite quote from this part of the paper: “The key features of these phenomena are that the microgenesis of ideas in gesture is, to some extent, independent from (and blazing the trail for) the microgenesis of ideas in speech, and that ideas develop in gesture via a process of trial and error” (p. 9) Gesture is linked to other ‘practical actions’ The authors argue that gestures share features in common with other practical actions that we do with our hands and other parts of the body. They make a number of observations on this point:  People gesture more when talking/thinking about things that involve movement Gesture rates also affected by how easy it would be to manipulate the objects being gestured about. In their example a picture of a spiky mug propted fewer gestures in a rotation task than a smooth mug (because who the heck would want to touch an ouchy mug?) If people have experience manipulating the object being discussed then they gesture about it more But, they note that there are some extra things that gestures can do for cognition that actions don’t. Firstly, because gestures have this ‘schematising’ function, they have a stronger influence on thought and they’re better for making generalisation while making relevant information more flexible and efficient. Secondly the authors argue that gestures can affect through more strongly than actions. In a map recollection task people who gestured to remember the route did better than people who drew it. They also discussed research on expert users of abacuses, who calculate faster with an imaginary abacus BECAUSE REAL ONES SLOW THEM DOWN TOO MUCH . Kita, Alibali and Chu didn’t write that all in capitals, but I’m still blown away by the idea that reality is holding back calculation.  They do note that it’s possible that sometimes schematic representations in gesture may not have the relevant information, or be distracting, but setting up an experiment to confirm this would be difficult.  But Lauren, don’t you always say that gesture and speech are closely linked??? I do, and they are. Kita, Alibali and Chu discuss this too: “We argue that this occurs because the action generation system and the speech production system are highly interactive. As proposed by Kita and Özyürek (2003), the two systems can exchange information and align their contents. Thus, the contents of concurrent gesture and speech tend to converge.” (p. 11) That is, gesture and speech are very closely related, but before that gesture and thought are very very closely related, and because speech is also linked to thought, it all tends to come together so quickly that it’s taken them decades of experiments to start pulling these relationships apart.  They also discuss how their model fits with some other research that looks at the relationship between gesture and language. For example, it’s been observed that gesture helps with retrieving words when you can’t quite remember them. The authors of this paper argue that this fits with their model, because the ‘activation’ function of gesture can retrieve a representation of an item or a feature of it, which then activates associated information such as the name for it. There has been a great deal of research that indicates that gestures are useful for the people that we are speaking to, not just our own thinking. The authors of this paper don’t deny that that may be the case, instead arguing that it is possible for gestures to be both self-oriented and have a communicative function. Indeed, the schematisation that is beneficial for the speaker’s cognition may also be what is so useful about them for an interlocutor. They also argue that this still works for objects that we have no direct experience interacting with, because we are also able to navigate a  “virtual environment” of experiences.  One final great quote from the paper that sums it all up “By schematizing spatio-motoric information for these four functions, activation, manipulation, packaging and exploration, gesture facilitates cognitive processing and generates novel ideas, strategies and solutions that are easy to process, adaptable, and generalizable.” (p. 14) Reference: Kita, S., Alibali, M.

For example,  color can help the observer find an object in a cluttered environment.  Although the human eye can distinguish millions of colors, human  languages have only a few color terms, such as “red,” “green,” “blue”  and “yellow,” which speakers can use to communicate about colors in  everyday life. These color terms change over time as a language evolves,  and the Japanese language is no exception.                                  This became  clear through the work of an international collaboration between  researchers at Tohoku University, their colleagues at Tokyo Institute of  Technology and Ohio State University. The researchers investigated the number of color categories (such as  aka, midori, ao, ki, etc.) that are commonly used by native Japanese  speakers. They asked 52 participants to name 320 color samples of  various hues and lightness (plus black, white and several grays) using  only single color words without modifiers (no “greenish yellow” or  “light purple”). Statistical analysis of the results revealed 19 common Japanese  categories. There were the 11 basic color categories common to most  modern industrialized cultures (red, green, blue, yellow, purple, pink,  brown, orange, white, gray and black), plus eight additional named color  categories. These were: mizu (“water”)/light blue, hada (“skin  tone”)/peach, matcha (“ceremonial green tea”)/yellow-green, oudo  (“mud”)/mustard, enji/maroon, yamabuki (“goldflower”)/gold and cream. Of  these additional terms, mizu was used by 98% of informants, making it a  strong candidate for a 12th Japanese basic color category. " False link

Although the domain of colour might seem fairly restricted, it is fascinating to see how diﬀerent languages around the world use diﬀerent language strategies to express it.       A language strategy is a particular approach to express one subareaof meaning. An example of such a strategy could be describing a colour using a single term which refers to a prototypical category.  A language system consists of specifc choices in how a particular language strategy is realised in a language, like for example the exact location of the colour categories and which terms to use to refer to these prototypes.” " False link
