The 44-year-old victim was headed home on a northbound 4 train in Harlem on Sunday night when two female cousins entered the train car and one took a seat next to the victim, sources said. The victim then offered his seat to 30-year-old Stephanie Pazmino, the cousin who was left standing, so that she could sit next to her relative, according to cops. “I don’t want your seat,” snapped Pazmino, who then turned to her cousin and stated in Spanish, “I don’t want to sit next to a black person,” sources said. A verbal dispute then ensued between the victim and Pazmino, who is Hispanic, and the victim got up from his seat and sat across from the two cousins. As the train pulled into the 125th Street station around 11 p.m., Pazmino walked up to the victim and slashed him several times in the left side of his face and stabbed him in his left arm, cops said. A good Samaritan on the train then intervened and escorted the bleeding victim off the train and onto the platform. Police showed up and arrested Pazmino, who was charged with assault as a hate crime, reckless endangerment and criminal possession of a weapon, cops said. Paramedics rushed the victim to Harlem Hospital, where he was treated for non-life-threatening injuries. Cops recovered the knife at the scene. Police interviewed Pazmino’s cousin, who confirmed the account. " False link

But many have now opened up about donations the star secretly made to countless good causes while insisting that he remained anonymous. Dame Esther Rantzen said Michael “gave millions” to Childline, of which she is the founder a president, but that he donated the money on the condition of anonymity while he was alive. “For years now he has been the most extraordinarily generous philanthropist, giving money to Childline, but he was determined not to make his generosity public so no-one outside the charity knew how much he gave to the nation’s most vulnerable children,” sad Dame Esther. Richard Osman, who co-hosts Pointless, also opened up saying he had given £15,000 to a contestant on Deal or No Deal who needed the money for IVF. Others included the Terrence Higgins Trust, which said Michael had given “experiences and gifts” to the charity over the years. ““His donations contributed to a vision of a world where people living with HIV live healthy lives free from prejudice and discrimination,” said Jane Barron of THT. “Thanks to George’s legacy, we are a step closer to that world and we are so grateful for his support and friendship over the years.” Other stories included that Michael had given a £25,000 cheque to a woman who he heard crying over debt in a cafe, asking the waitress to hand it over once he had left. Another came from radio DJ Mick Brown, who opened up about an annual £100,000 donation made by Michael to Capital FM’s Christmas charity drive. Journalist Sali Hughes took to Twitter to say she had written a story about a celebrity who had given £5,000 to a barmaid who was a student nurse in debt, revealing that it was Michael. Many more stories including offering a free concert to NHS nurses who cared for his late mother, and volunteering at a homeless shelter, poured out as thousands mourned the death of the Wham! star. This is in addition to his performances on charity singles like ‘Do They Know It’s Christmas?’, donating royalties from his Elton John duet ‘Don’t Let the Sun Go Down On Me’ to an AIDS hospice, and much other public charity work.

Some of these men don’t think of their behavior as ‘gay’ because they’re ‘manly men’ who just have oral sex with other ‘manly men’ once in a while. “As Cain [one of the interview subjects] said, “I’m really not drawn to what I would consider really effeminate faggot type[s],” but he does “like the masculine looking guy who maybe is more bi.” Similarly, Matt (60) explained, “If they’re too flamboyant they just turn me off,” and Jack noted, “Femininity in a man is a turn off.” Ryan (60) explained, “I’m not comfortable around femme” and “masculinity is what attracts me,” while David shared that “Femme guys don’t do anything for me at all, in fact actually I don’t care for ’em.” Jon shared, “I don’t really like flamin’ queers.” “I go on road trips, drink beer, go down to the city [to] look at chicks, go out and eat, shoot pool, I got one friend I hike with. It normally leads to sex, but we go out and do activities other than we meet and suck.” Pat described a typical meetup with his regular: “We talk for an hour or so, over coffee … then we’ll go get a blowjob and then, part our ways.” Similarly, Richard noted, “Sex is a very small part of our relationship. It’s more friends, we discuss politics … all sorts of shit.” “The participants reinforced their straightness through unconventional interpretations of same-sex sex: as “helpin’ a buddy out,” relieving “urges,” acting on sexual desires for men without sexual attractions to them.”  helpin’ a buddy out  I always have such conflicted reactions to things like this. Because on one level, it has an element of genuine tragic-ness to it, that these men clearly feel same-sex attraction, but CANNOT admit that fact to themselves, even in the midst of admitting that they sleep with other men.  But on the other hand, the mental gymnastics that they employ and the convoluted ways they try to endlessly reframe it as being still Hetero™ somehow do have an air of comedy to them, at times. (I mean “bud-sex” REALLY?)  Yeah, this is legitimately saddening. Our society failed these people.  I’ve known a few of these guys. They are responding to several social pressures, so it’s pretty complicated and it’s not really accurate to ascribe it solely to toxic masculinity or heteronormativity or whatever. The one thing you should not assume is that they are anything other than straight. They are not closeted gay or bi men who are aware of their identities and are just waiting for the right opportunity to free themselves. They are straight, and they wield the full power of that privilege. Even being “found out” doesn’t negate their privilege; it’s not unusual for everyone around them, even wives, to normalize it as “being close.” As in “yup, Jake and Tom always were close.” If they’re young enough then maybe you might hear “it’s just a phase.” A lot of these guys stop having MM sex when they get married, to be faithful to their wives. A lot of these guys don’t regard MM sex to be cheating on their wives. These two groups are not mutually exclusive; often the former becomes the latter over time. Most of these guys really do bond with their male partners, and care deeply for them. In that respect they manage to tear down at least one of the walls that toxic masculinity builds. I haven’t found them to be particularly dangerous either. They’re not the guys out driving around the red light district looking for gays to bash. They don’t tend to be violent when confronted about their sexuality. I guess because they’ve made some sort of peace with it, even if it is a highly normalized, socially pressured sort of peace. They’re not bad guys, and in many ways they’re not even living unexamined lives, so pity isn’t something I feel for them. They are definitely products of our society, though, and are a pretty big sign of just how screwed up we are about sex and gender. " False link

A single fastened button at the waist helped show off his fantastic figure and a pale blue tie brought out the colour of his eyes. Round glasses perched on his nose accentuated his amazing bone structure – no doubt one of the assets he used to help him to bag his wife. " False link

Maryland had a similar law until 99 when they upped the minimum age for the pregnant+parental approval to 15 because of outrage when a 29 year old married a 13 year old (which I remember because it was IN MY AREA, EW). Last I heard, MD has people trying to get it to no one under 18 can get married, which yeah, let’s get that shit done  Okay, 13 and 29 is creepy af but what’s wrong with say, a 17-year-old marrying another 17-yr-old? I know some people who got married at 16 or 17 to their peers (note my emphasis). I don’t understand the last comment - at 17 you’re expected to know how to drive, have political affiliations because in a year you’re going to be able to vote, choose your lifetime career and what you want to spend thousands upon thousands of dollars learning…and you can’t get married to someone else in the same boat?  Maybe, I dunno, WAIT A GODDAMN YEAR? You sound very much like a 17-year-old that’s feeling slighted by this, in which case, allow me to offer this advice: WAIT A GODDAMN YEAR. Seriously, if your relationship passes the 4-seasons (Have you been together during at least 4 seasons?) test, maybe it’s time to start thinking about engagements, maybe. At that young, you’re both still growing up, having experiences, and learning who you are. Things change environmentally, change with family, with other friends… COLLEGE changes things dramatically for nearly everyone. Wait it out, don’t rush into marriage when you’re that young. And yes, 17 *IS* “that young”.  I’m not 17. I’m 27. I met my husband when I was 18 and we got engaged…in about 3 weeks. And we’ve been together for 9 years now. But I also have friends who are my age who are still happily married to someone they’ve been with since they were 12 (which, honestly, is impressive because I dated like, 4 different people who were not my husband between ages 10 and 18). But I’m also the girl who got engaged at 14 to someone else, and the only reason I didn’t marry her was because I became Mormon and when that happened, we agreed to end it - nearly 4 years later. I actually didn’t want to but my fiancee said that if I tried being Mormon all the way and it suited me, I should do it. So I tried it and it did. But if I’d been married at the time, I wouldn’t have gotten a divorce. I know people who got legally married at 16 who got divorced. But I also know people who were 26 or 36 or even 46 who did the same thing, even though they’re supposed to be so much more mature than a 16-year-old. And I’ve seen 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds get married and stay married for a decade or more. But in most states, in order to be married between the ages of 15 and 17 (because at 18 you don’t need anyone’s permission so long as both of you are 18 or more), you need parental consent and/or a court order anyway. So it’s not like you can just run off to Vegas and get hitched in a drunken haze and then get divorced the next morning (unlike, say, so-called adults, who can and do run off to Vegas, get drunk, get married, and get divorced 5 seconds later). I didn’t say 17 wasn’t young. 27 is young, too. But I think it’s unfair that we expect 17-year-olds to act like adults (they’re supposed to have jobs, they’re supposed to be able to drive, they’re supposed to pay taxes, they’re supposed to go to college, they’re supposed to choose their life-long career, they can enlist in the fracking military - which is a minimum 2-year commitment and can get you very, very dead depending on where you end up - as long as they don’t ship off to Basic before they’re 18, they can be tried as adults for pretty much every crime ever) but then we treat them like they’re too stupid to make life decisions??? So pick one. Either they’re too young to be making decisions about the rest of their life or they’re not.  Look, I’m going to level with you. I honest and for real don’t even have the spoons to deal with replying to this. I’ve been in massive spoon debt for the last 2 weeks, and I don’t have the energy or mental coping ability to respond. Congratulations on your marriage, I hope everything’s happy and you’re both getting fulfilled by the other. Take care.  Thank you. Also, “I don’t have the spoons” is like, super cute and creative? Would it be okay if I started saying that?  Spoon Theory is from this article: http://www.butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/It’s generally reserved for those of us with chronic pain, disabilities, mental illness, or the like. While I obviously can’t speak for all people with any or all of those conditions, I also obviously can’t stop you from using it if you’re able-bodied and/or neurotypical, either, so I’ll just say use it at your discretion. =)" False link
