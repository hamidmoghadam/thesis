Pharah has been reduced to Anas daughter and has only gotten 2 epics since release, Mei hasn’t gotten any real lore of her own, D.Va and Lucio only have their backstory, Zarya showed up in a short for 5 seconds but also doesn’t have lore other than her character description, Zenyatta and Hanzo only exist as accessories to Genjis story + Hanzo only got 1 skin in total, Symmetra has a comic but she’s not even allowed to have a real cameo in the lore, got 2 epic skins, and barely has voice lines, and the Junkers are also on their own lore-island.  Regardless whether you like the characters or not (I don’t care for the Junkers for example), they all have fans and the fans deserve pretty skins and lore content for their favourite characters. Tracer, Reinhardt, Torbjörn, FUCKING BASTION, etc. have all gotten more attention than all of them " False text

Kaplan oversees a crack squad of game development operatives tasked with the following mission parameters: design a highly stylized team-based multiplayer shooter set on a near-future earth, featuring a diverse cast of extraordinary characters embroiled in an epic, globe-spanning conflict. And make it awesome.Jeff is the seventh tank to join the Overwatch lineup, and much like his real life skill, his gameplay is engineered around wrestling. His main weapon is are his Fists, which he uses to punch people. Jeff’s movement is slow, and his weapon requires a long wind-up time, but he packs quite the punch! His alternate fire, Suplex, does just as it says. When Jeff is within range, he will grab the hero closest to him and suplex them, resulting in an instant kill.His Catapult ability grabs the nearest enemy and launches them across the world. Say you are on the first point of Hanamura and you were to use Catapult, the enemy would be thrown to another map, such as Point 2 of Ilios. He can Pin enemies just like Reinhardt, but, he does not pin them to the wall. Instead he pins them to the ground. The enemy will be faced with a quick-time event and will have to struggle to get up. If they cannot get up within 10 seconds, they will be instantly killed. Finally, we have Jeff’s ultimate, Game-Breaking Bug. Upon activating this ultimate, the entire map will disappear and everybody but you will fall to their death.To learn more about Jeff, click here.GENERAL UPDATES:Quick and Competitive PlayPicking the following heroes will result in an immediate loss for your team:Hanzo, Widowmaker, Sombra, Bastion, Symmetra, Genji, TorbjörnDeveloper Comments: Tired of that pesky Hanzo main? That Pro Genji who claims he’s carrying your team? Well fear no more! This change will make it so that your team actually has a chance of winning.HERO UPDATES:Ana:She’s lost her other eye. Upon choosing Ana, the screen will go black. Now players will have to shoot and just hope for the best.Bastion:Bastion now has an infinite clip and can one shot all heroes.McCree:Damage decreased from 70 to 1.Developer Comments: We felt that McCree was too strong, so his damage has been decreased dramatically.Mei:Endothermic Blaster range increased from 10 meters to 50 meters.Ice Wall is now unbreakable and lasts forever. You will not be leaving your spawn room until late 2017.Roadhog:Hook now has the ability to home onto enemies.Reinhardt:Rocket Hammer has been replaced with a Small Stick. It breaks upon use, and in order to replace it you will have to run back to spawn for a new one. You can only hold one Small Stick at a time.BUG FIXES:CompetitiveFixed a bug where you would not be immediately placed in the Grandmaster rank after finishing your placement matches.HeroesFixed a bug where Torbjörn was a playable character.Fixed a bug that made it possible for Tracer to die.MapsEvery map has been converted to the Two Point Capture gamemode."
