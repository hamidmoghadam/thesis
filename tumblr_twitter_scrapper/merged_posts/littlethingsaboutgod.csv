Everything in the surrounding culture encourages us to create the life that we want, to see the fulfillment of our own goals as the ultimate prize, to stand apart from the crowd by being truly selfish. Of course, Christianity suggests otherwise. It tells us that meeting our own desires is not the path to godly success. Jesus quotes from the ancients in Deuteronomy and Leviticus when He reminds His audience precisely what we ought to value most: to love God with all of our energy and passion, and to love others as much as ourselves. Selfless living does not mean placing others on an equal footing with ourselves, handing out the compassion in step with the self-indulgence. True Christianity—to be near the kingdom of God, to understand the very fibers that hold together the essence of Christianity, to put our faith into bold practice—means handing over our own agendas in place of serving God and others. It might not be sexy or culturally on-message, but it’s there, in plain and simple truth." True text

They blindside us with unrelenting blows from the mundane corners of everyday life. There is too much to do, too many fronts to defend, too many fires to put out. So what deceives us into traveling the days as though we have strength enough to be the savior of our own lives? Do we conclude (quietly, secretly, where even our own thoughts can barely hear) that since God is doing nothing, then we must somehow make a way for ourselves? Too often, we miss Jesus. Striving the way we do always makes the distance between us and Him ache with inconsolable longing. But the damnable part of that is that it doesn’t have to be so! He is there with us; He remains still. Patient. Waiting. Being God. Of the pressures and distractions and decisions we must face each day, there is (it seems) no end. But there is only one decision that truly matters. And that is the decision to cling close to Jesus, to hang trembling to his garments, whatever battle-lines form against us at our backs. Choosing not to fight in our own strength. But to believe, and to rest." True text

It’s about acknowledging our desperate need of a Savior to pull us out of the darkness. In Jesus, brokenness can be beautiful because when we surrender it to Him, He not only accepts it in full, but also lovingly took upon the wrath that our sins deserve. So stop trying to appear whole, we’re all broken. Everyone is. But if you surrender wholly and invite Him into your life, He’ll give you a new heart, with peace and joy in Him everlasting."

There is the woman suffering from a prolonged discharge of blood (Luke 8:43-48) and the Roman centurion concerned for the well-being of his bedridden servant (Matt. 8:5-13). Neither is named, yet both become the benefactors of Christ’s healing mercies. Perhaps the most famous anonymous figure of the New Testament is the Samaritan woman Jesus met at a well outside of her community. After a brief conversation, she beheld Christ and raced back to her town to declare the saving mercies of the Messiah (John 4:1-45). Many of her neighbors experienced salvation as a result of her testimony, yet we never learn her name.Anonymity is a feature common to each of these individuals. God has seen fit to include them in His story of redemption, but Scripture omits their names. Not because they are without value, but because the point of their lives, like ours, is to make great the Name Above All Names—the Sovereign God, I Am.

But is that really true?My first thought whenever I hear this argument is, “Who gave the Church this job?” Obviously the implied answer is God. After all, Jesus does talk a lot about His followers’ responsibility for taking care of the downtrodden, poor and oppressed. If you read His parable about the sheep and the goats, it’s easy to walk away with the impression that eternal life rests entirely upon whether or not a person cares for the poor.

For me, it’s practical: I concentrate better and don’t fall asleep. It’s also allegorical: a frequent biblical metaphor of the life of faith is “walking with God” (Genesis 5:4; Deuteronomy 11:22; Colossians 1:10).I was prayer-walking recently when Micah 6:8 came to mind with the kind of sharp clarity that often proves to be the prompting of the Spirit. I pulled it up on my phone app and read it:He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God? (Micah 6:6–8)Two words stopped my in my tracks: “Love kindness.” The imperative scanned my heart like a searchlight. Do I really love kindness? Or do I mainly love the idea of kindness? I frequently pray, “Search me, O God, and know my heart! Try me and know my thoughts!” (Psalm 139:23). He was taking me up on my invitation.This heart examination continued and spread through the rest of verse: Do I really “do justice”? Or do I mainly affirm the idea of justice? Is my “doing justice” mainly “not doing injustice” myself, but rarely pursuing justice for others?" True link

The comment sections on many Christian articles can attest to this fact.In the Bible, Jesus sends His disciples out two by two to share the gospel, but He gives them the command to “shake the dust off [their] feet” and leave when they were not welcomed (Matthew 10:14). This way the gospel could continue to advance and no time was wasted on people whose only goal was to stir up dissension.If we apply these instructions of Jesus to our online behavior today, shaking the dust off our fingers, perhaps people wouldn’t just characterize us as hateful and angry. We don’t need to reply to every comment we disagree with. A place for healthy debate should always exist, but nine times out of ten that place is not the comment section." True link

Instead, we can talk back to ourselves. We can take our thoughts captive. We can speak the truth of God’s word to our hearts, for the word has the power to change and transform us. “Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth” (John 17:17). Lies lose their power in the face of truth. We need to know God’s word by heart so that it is always on the tip of our tongue, ready for us to fire at the lies we hear around us — especially those within our own hearts.The gospel isn’t something we respond to once in our life at the moment of salvation. Rather, it’s something we respond to and apply to our life each and every day. We need to preach the gospel to ourselves, remembering all that we have in Christ. We need to remember what Christ did for us in his perfect life, sacrificial death, and triumphant resurrection. We cling to the precious reality that God, who didn’t spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, will certainly give us everything we need (Romans 8:32). When it comes to our overthinking, we need to rebuke and correct ourselves with the truths of what Jesus has done, what he is doing, and what he will do." True link

We all know that’s just the way it is. Much of life is out of our control, and these seasons come and go. We all have these stages with God that shape our faith and who we are today.But somehow we still try to control everything, especially when it comes to parts of life that involve struggles and trials. I’m learning more and more that my reactions toward trials become some of the most shaping experience in life.Most of us run away when trouble comes because we haven’t prepared to react to this with hope and strength. And that’s because it’s hard to prepare for trials when you’re in the middle of them. But it’s a whole other thing to prepare for it beforehand." True link

We relate to God out of fear because we don’t want to upset the slave master.We work and strive, trying to earn what is already ours to begin with. But grace says that we can’t earn any more of God’s love, nor can we lose an ounce of it because of anything we’ve done or ever will do. It’s grace. It’s a gift. It’s ours for the taking. Trust it and receive it.Grace is always opposed to earning, but it’s not opposed to effort. In fact, grace makes demands. Grace calls out the best from us. Grace reorients everything we thought we knew about life. Grace confronts us in ways that may be uncomfortable." True link

I cannot get up and give you anything’? I tell you, though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, yet because of his impudence he will rise and give him whatever he needs.” (Luke 11:5–8)What’s odd is that a story about a socially humiliating situation and a reluctant, irritated benefactor is supposed to encourage us to pray. What does Jesus want us to see in this kind of need and this kind of provider?" True link

Shall we assume it’s the same three women?Luke’s gospel talks about “the women who had come with Jesus from Galilee” (Luke 23:55) at the end of one chapter and then begins the next with “the women took the spices they had prepared.” (Luke 24:1) If Luke meant all the women from Galilee, that would have been quite a number, and Mary of Nazareth would likely have been counted among them.Matthew’s gospel mentions only two women: “Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, came to see the sepulcher.” (Mt. 28:1 GNV) And John’s gospel names just one woman: “Mary Magdalene went to the tomb.” (John 20:1)" True link

It was built with extraordinary potential—to be an example of Christ’s love on this earth. The partnership we take on with another person is dynamic and beautiful. But it often takes a windy road of repositioning and adjusting, for it to become all we hope it will be.Truth be told, a marriage will only be as healthy or prosperous as the two people in it endeavor to be. Fortunately, God will help us flourish as individuals and as a pair, if we are committed to Him through it. He is the one who created marriage, and He’s the expert at developing it." True link

Acute pain, whether physical or psychological, is not a balanced experience. It’s a dominating experience. Such pain shoves its way to the front of our priorities and almost always distorts our perspective. When it’s flaring, we tend to say things that we wouldn’t otherwise say, and in ways we wouldn’t otherwise say them.What’s crucial for any comforter or counselor is to discern whether angry or exasperated or despairing words are coming from an afflicted person’s soul-core(their deeply held, life-governing beliefs) or from their soul-sore (a flaring pain temporarily distorting a person’s perspective). There is a huge and important difference." True link

We brought in addictions, abuses of all kinds, trust and control issues, fears, unforgiveness, shame, and a million other intimacy-killing challenges.Rather than ask God to heal our tangled hearts, we foolishly thought love would fix everything. We thought it would complete us. It didn’t.We decided that children would fix our problems, so we had two babies fourteen months apart. In our desperation, we thought starting a family would bring us closer together. It didn’t.And the disappointing months turned into disappointing years. It felt hopeless. I felt hopeless. But hopeless isn’t part of God’s language." True link
