This, however, says nothing about the kinds of institutions most likely to produce good infrastructure or who should fund it….With healthcare reform stalling, President Trump’s administration seems ready to shift focus onto infrastructure. Here’s a handy guide to some of the bad economic reasoning you will likely hear as the debate about infrastructure spending heats up.Past benefits don’t mean future benefits. Highway construction can substantially boost productivity for industries associated with road use, but those benefits are largely one-offs. Too many new highways were built between 1983 and 2003, and marginal extensions to the highway system are unlikely to increase social welfare because the cost savings from reduced travel times are relatively small. We should judge new projects on their own merits, not against old examples or countries in different circumstances.Don’t ignore opportunity costs. As legislation for infrastructure is pushed, we will hear plenty about the costs of delays to the economy. These costs are undoubtedly very real, but so are the costs of building new infrastructure, and that money can’t then be spent on other things that we might have preferred to spend them on. But what about that one bridge…? Individual catastrophic events can lead to concern about the physical conditions of infrastructure. You often hear that 58,791 bridges are structurally deficient, which sounds kinda scary, but, according to the Federal Highways Agency, “structurally deficient does not mean that it is likely to collapse or that it is unsafe.” The proportion of bridges labeled structurally deficient has also fallen from 24.1% in 1990 to 9.6% in 2015.”Cheap debt doesn’t make everything a bargain. If there are structural reasons why demand for transportation use is falling, then any investment would yield far fewer economic benefits. Infrastructure decisions should be judged by robust estimates of costs and expected benefits, not just how cheap it is to borrow.How stimulus actually works… Two well-known arguments for infrastructure investment are 1) that government investment spending can be used to “stimulate” the economy and put people back to work., and 2) that smart, efficient investments can help enhance long-term productivity growth. These two ambitions often conflict. Attempts to stimulate quickly and get people back to work will likely result in sloppy project selection and the hiring of more labor than would be most efficient. And, infrastructure funds will likely go preferentially to the well-connected.Learn More…" False text

If you know any Sanders supporters, you need to show them this. I know this will go way over most Sanders supporters heads but here goes nothing. This is the economic impact of Sanders’ tax plan. Tax plans vary by 2016 candidate, but Sanders plan is the only that will not just slow real GDP growth, but actually shrink our economy. This is economic disaster.   Conclusion:  Senator Bernie Sanders would enact a number of tax policies that  would raise tax revenue over the next decade. Together, his proposals  would significantly expand federal revenue collections by $13.6 trillion  on a static basis, driven mostly by broad-based taxes on income and  payroll. If enacted, the Sanders plan would significantly increase  marginal tax rates on capital and labor income, which would result in a  substantial reduction of the size of the U.S. economy in the long run.  This would decrease the revenue that the new tax policies would  ultimately collect to $9.8 trillion. Senator Sanders’s plan would  decrease after-tax incomes for taxpayers at all income levels, but  especially high-income taxpayers.   You do know our GDP skyrocketed during the 2008 collapse, yea? GDP is only accurate when shit’s going fine. When things are fucked up it STILL GOES UP. The GDP going down doesn’t actually mean all that much in the shitshow we’re in- not to mention you tardlingers are thinking short term. You gotta bite the bullet, you gotta jump in the lake, and you gotta rip off the band aid or it’s gonna be a lot more painful for a lot longer.Not to mention THE MEGA RICH ACTUALLY PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE would cause the market to become more even, money that has stagnated in mountains high bank accounts to actually be in the public sector again, and people on the bottom level will ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO GET MONEY THAT THEY WILL THEN SPENDIf the bottom rung is commonly spending money, that means the economy is good. No matter what bitch fit you spew, that is what his plan will cause- and that can only be good.  “You do know our GDP skyrocketed during the 2008 collapse, yea?” What the fuck are you talking about?  Real and Nominal GDP both fell in the 2008 meltdown. Nominal GDP could just mean prices fell, but when real GDP falls, that literally means that the economy shrank; it means the economy produced less goods and services than it previously did. That means less food, less clothing, less TV”s, less everything. Real GDP is the indicator of economic progress. Your next paragraph is right out of Keynesian Theory. You accuse the rich of hoarding money and not paying their fair share. You’re right. The rich don’t pay their fair share, they pay almost everyone’s fair share.  When you criticize the rich for saving money and claim it is detrimental to the economy, meanwhile this concept was refuted by a man much smarter than I, in 1929. Essentially, those savings are still used in the economy, banks, using fractional reserve can lend more money out to others. That money is used in a various number of ways, but most importantly, on capital investments. Capital investments are what drives up GDP year to year. They are goods not used immediately for consumption but further production. The increase in supply not only accounts for the lack of spending, but reduces costs of living, most notably, helping the poor. Economics is not on your side here.  " False link

Most beneficiaries have complete freedom to choose their  doctor, and appointment waiting times are almost as low as those in the  U.S., the world leader. *Looks at Norway* Finland also has a low number of general practitioners, and until  recently Finns had to wait a long time for care. The government  introduced waiting-time targets in 2005, and things have improved,  according to the OECD. Norway has also implemented reforms, thereby  improving service, reducing waiting times, and increasing levels of  treatment. But costs have risen steeply due to the volume of services  and increasing salaries, says the OECD. Oil revenues give little  incentive to impose cost-cutting measures.  Although state ownership is declining in Norway , it still has a long  way to go. The government owns some of the largest companies in Norway,  such as Statoil, which is partially privatized, and Norsk Hydro. The  government also owns other enterprises ranging from electric plants to  banks. Norway ‘s problems extend beyond its lack of privatization.  Norwegian labor costs and taxes deter investment as well.   I bet its regulated to shit and back in Switzerland.In Norway I don’t see much of a problem. Salaries go up and prices go up.I significantly prefer regulation to state ownership fwiw  “I bet its regulated to shit and back in Switzerland.“ Switzerland is the 4th most free economy in the world.

An excerpt:This expanded bombing campaign, though, could be just the tip of the iceberg. In early March, The Guardian reported that the White House is considering a secret Pentagon proposal to designate temporary areas of active hostility in which the military could launch what amounts to six-month wars without congressional approval. Under the proposal, once the president signs off on a temporary battlefield, commanders would be given “the same latitude to launch strikes, raids and campaigns” as they now have in active U.S. warzones like Iraq. Protections for civilians would also be scaled back.These temporary battlefields, as The Guardian dubbed them, are not exactly new; the Obama administration already applied the label to conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. But the proposal Trump is considering would expand and formalize that decision, stretching the temporary battlefield designation to cover entire countries in which the United States is technically not at war. Despite the bureaucratic language, Trump’s plan, if implemented, is a flagrant perversion of the Constitution, redoubling the worst excesses of the Obama administration and further undercutting the rule of law."

Canyon Mansfield, 14, was playing with his yellow Labrador retriever, Casey, on Thursday afternoon near his home east of Pocatello when he saw what he thought was a sprinkler head on the ground and touched the device, causing it to detonate. The explosion sprayed the boy and his 3-year-old, 90-pound (40 kg) pet with toxic cyanide gas, according to the boy’s mother, Theresa Mansfield. “Canyon said there was a bang like a bomb, then an explosion of an orange substance that covered him and Casey, who was writhing in pain on the ground before he died right in front of Canyon,” she said. Her husband, Pocatello physician Mark Mansfield, rushed to the scene and pounded on the dog’s chest in a futile effort to revive the animal. The family and first-responders underwent decontamination procedures and the boy, who was sprayed in the face, was tested for cyanide poisoning at a hospital for the second time Friday, officials and family members said. The device, called an M-44, was among several placed in the area by Wildlife Services, an arm of the U.S. Department of Agriculture that targets coyotes, wolves, cougars, foxes and other animals considered nuisances to farms and ranches. The agency has been sued by conservation groups claiming that its programs to poison, trap and shoot various predator species violate federal environmental and wildlife protection laws.
