So I’m just going to post it here. Thank you so much for the prompt! Enjoy! “Guys, come on! The pins are for holding the skin down, not stabbing the frog’s eyes!” Clarke groaned, weaving her way through tables surrounded by short, wild eyed kids in order to reach a pair in the back. Jasper and Monty always had a habit of getting a little too into the dissections, and ordinarily Clarke wouldn’t be bothered by it. But when frog juice starts flying everywhere, she knows it’s time to intervene. By the time she’s wrestled the scalpel away from Jasper’s twitchy fingers and rushed a pale boy with clammy hands to the nurse, the lunch bell had already rung, and her kids were throwing their messy gloves at each other and laughing.  Clarke sighed, shaking her head and making her way back to her desk at the front of the room. “Don’t forget to clean up before you leave!” Clarke called, tossing her white coat onto her desk as she collapsed into her seat. Chairs were pushed in half-hazardly as the kids rushed out, some describing in horrifying detail what exactly they had done to their frogs as they left. Sighing, Clarke rubbed at her temples. Kids were something else. Unraveling her hair from her bun, she pushed herself off the desk and clambered out of her chair, following the elusive smell of coffee into the teacher’s lounge. There she made an immediate beeline for the coffee pot, brushing past Raven with no more than a quick hello. She’d ask about that big project the physics teacher was working on for her kids later. Right now, coffee was essential. Except when Clarke had finally wrapped her handle around the pot, there was quite literally nothing left, save for a thin rim of residual coffee grounds. Biting back a frustrated scream, Clarke shuffled the pot around in her hand, watching in anger as the last few dredges of coffee swirled at the bottom. The jerk who’d taken the last of the coffee didn’t even have the decency to start a new batch. “Something wrong, Princess?” Oh god. Clarke squeezed her eyes shut, pursing her lips and counting to ten before slowly turning to face the one and only Bellamy Blake. Read More" False text

Mum used to make the best lemonades with sunshine.” A little romantic ficlet in preparation for the emotional wringing we’re sure to face in tonight’s episode. Basically Bellamy being a muggle (and Clarke falling for him anyway) is what I live and breath for :D -/-  Clarke never asked for any of this. She needs to remember that. She never asked to be a pureblood, never asked to go to Hogwarts, or get bitten by a werewolf. She never asked for her dad to be killed, for her house to be burned down, or for her mother to go missing.  She certainly never asked to spend the summer in Octavia’s very muggle street, in her very muggle house, sharing the same space as her gorgeous but very muggle brother who Clarke’s been half in love with ever since she first saw them at Kings Cross.  Clarke’s putting everything at risk by just being here. She’s putting him at risk. “Home sweet home,” Bellamy Blake sounds friendly enough, but Clarke doesn’t miss the flash in his eyes as he glances at her.  Or the spike in his heartbeat, the salty-tang of fear in his scent.  He’s terrified of her.  Or, more likely considering what she already knows of him, terrified on behalf of his sister because Clarke is pretty much her only friend. And Clarke’s a feral werewolf on the run from The Ministry for killing a man.  If the shoe had been on the other foot Clarke doesn’t think she’d even let him into her house. “The house only has two bedrooms so you get Octavia’s for now. We’ll revisit the living situation when she returns from Romania.” Clarke nods faintly, adjusting the bag in her hand and Bellamy looks really annoyed for a second before he grabs it from her. “I’m a nurse,” he tells her as she follows him to the door. He unlocks it with a shiny silver key but instead of going in first he hangs back and gestures her ahead. “I probably can’t fix 90 per cent of wizarding injuries but I’m pretty damn good at the remaining 10 percent. So let me know immediately if you need any medical help, yeah?” Clarke nods then winces at the sight of the floral wallpaper in the corridor. It’s a horrific shade of purple with red flowers. “In addition to being a nurse I’m also incredibly colour blind,” Bellamy’s ears redden at Clarke’s reaction and her cheeks blaze at it being noticed. “I normally wait for Octavia for this kind of stuff but we had a row before she left and I thought I could do it myself.” “You were wrong.” “Obviously.”  He hesitates when she doesn’t step back as he comes inside. The corridor is small and narrow and there really isn’t enough space for them both. “Clarke?” He asks hesitantly as if she’s a wild animal and she supposes she is. “I just wanted to say thanks.” She fidgets as she deliberates whether to kiss his cheek or not, but then decides she wouldn’t be able to take it if he flinched. “You didn’t have to take me in.” “Yeah I did. You’re Octavia’s best friend. I don’t know what that means wherever you’re from, but around here that makes you family.” Clarke doesn’t really smile much any more, but the vehemence behind his words makes her want to. She supposes that’s progress. -/- “So,” Bellamy tells her after he carries her bag into Octavia’s room. “I’m going to go get started on dinner. Is there anything in particular that you’d like to eat?” It’s been years since she’s eaten proper home cooked food, and there are too many things to choose from (too many things she misses). Her dad was a muggle too and he was the best cook. He always said he used a different type of magic in the kitchen and the comment made her mum smile every time.  The day after his death Clarke became a werewolf  and went on the run, and she’s been living off whatever creatures she could find in the forest ever since.  A proper home-cooked meal would be perfect. “Anything,” she tries to smile but thinks it comes off as a grimace instead. “I’m not a picky eater.” Bellamy makes lasagna. It’s easily the best one she’s ever eaten. She takes three helpings and has just started on the fourth when she notices Bellamy’s amused expression. “What?”  “Nothing.” “You’re laughing at me.” “No I’m not.” His smirk widens. “I just haven’t had that reaction to my lasagna before. I should have you around more often, it’s a real ego boost.” Clarke blushes but doesn’t say anything. She does slow down though, and picks up her so far unused knife. It might not look like it at that moment, but Abbey Griffin didn’t actually raise a wild animal. -/- Bellamy works nights, which makes sense really. Octavia adores her brother and wouldn’t risk him intentionally. So over the next few months Clarke locks herself in the garage during her change. With her mum missing she makes her own wolfsbane, it’s the one potion she’s able to make without messing up which is ironic considering how advanced it is.  “What is that?” She hears Bellamy’s breath hitch as she uncaps the vial full of the last ingredient. He’s taken to watching whenever she brews the wolfsbane, initially because he didn’t trust her, but lately because he’s actually interested. But he has never had time to see the entirety of it before.  “Moonlight.” “You can stopper moonlight?” his voice sounds full of wonder like a child’s and Clarke can’t help her grin. “You can stopper anything. Mum used to make the best lemonades with sunshine.” The potion is finally complete with a strand of her hair and then in a fit of whimsy she stoppers a bit of starlight into a vial and offers it to him.  “What’s that?” He asks as he stares at the white nebula inside it. “Starlight,” She presses the vial into the palm of his hand. In the olden days witches would give starlight to the men they loved to protect them. She figures if he’s stuck with her anyway he might as well get something out of it.  “Thanks,” The smile he gives Clarke is breathtaking but she doesn’t really have much time to enjoy it because he chooses that moment to kiss her. His lips are dry, chapped, but Clarke has never been kissed so perfectly before. She winds her arms around his neck immediately to deepen the kiss, arches her body up desperately against his to get closer, and then growls when he pulls her leg up high over his hip. “Nobody’s ever done magic for me before,” Bellamy admits to her under the covers of his bed, his eyes half-closed. Clarke cups his face gently in her hands. She knows a little about the Blake siblings’ childhoods from Octavia. She knows their mom was a witch but that she was never around for either of them, knows that Bellamy risked his life by letting Octavia practice her magic on him, knows he sacrificed his hopes and dreams to raise his sister even when he didn’t have the first clue how to manage her magic.   Clarke knows that when Octavia is really, really sick, and calls out for her dad she really means Bellamy. “I’m not that good,” She kisses his brow. “I’d show you everything if I could.” “You’re good enough for me.” Strangely enough, for the first time in her life, Clarke believes it. -/- " False text

(“I don’t understand why you’re also blaming me ,” mutters Miller mulishly, “ She’s the one who made the bet with him. I had nothing to do with their bullshit ideas.” “You spurred them on,” says Clarke, and he rolls his eyes, but doesn’t deny it.) It starts when Miller returns from vacationing with his dad up in the mountains sporting a full beard. His beard isn’t really anything new to them- normally he just errs on the side of scruffy, but has been known to grow it out once in a while, especially back when they were in college- so there’s just the general ribbing and maybe one or two pointed comments dropped by Monty before they ignore it. And then Bellamy gets drunk. Bellamy doesn’t usually get drunk when they go out; in fact he’s usually the one still annoyingly sober while they do stupid shit like climbing up on the tables or trying to rewire the jukebox. But it is the start of summer break and all his AP students passed their exams so if there was an occasion for overdoing the celebratory drinking, this would be it. Drunken Bellamy is even sort of cute, far more tactile and vocal about his affection. Which is why it’s no surprise that as the night wears on, they find him gently stroking Miller’s cheek murmuring all sorts of nonsense while Miller looks three seconds away from throttling him. Clarke sneaks a picture. She’s totally going to use this in a mood board when his birthday comes around. “I’m so jealous of your beard,” he slurs, just a little, and Miller slaps his fingers away. “I’ve always wanted a beard.” “I don’t know if you’ve realised this,” says Raven, dropping in from seemingly out of nowhere, “But you’ve got all the components you need to grow a beard, Blake.” Miller snorts at the exact same moment Bellamy’s face falls. “Yeah, no. Theoretically he might have them but trust me on this. Blake is as bare faced as they come.” Raven’s eyes practically light up at that and her head snaps back to look at him. “You can’t grow a beard?” she asks delightedly. “Of course I can grow a beard,” he grumbles. “Then how come we’ve never seen you with one?” “Because it’s uncomfortable .” “Uh huh, sure. That’s why.” She lifts an eyebrow. “I bet you can’t grow a full beard like Miller’s before the month’s up.” “Easiest fucking bet you’ve ever made, Reyes,” says Miller, and Bellamy elbows him in the ribs. “I can totally grow a beard in the next three weeks,” he protests. “I don’t need to prove that to you.” “Methinks the man doth protests too much,” she says in a sing-song voice, and his scowl deepens. “I’m not protesting. And that’s not the quote.” “Come on,” she wheedles, “Fifty bucks says you can’t.” He glowers at her for one last moment before finally caving. “Fine,” he sighs, sticking his hand out for her to shake. She does so rather enthusiastically and Clarke already knows that this is going to be a disaster. “I’ll take your stupid bet.” Keep reading " False text

And when she stops and scoots her chair away from the table, she finally breathes again. And she can’t look away.“Who is that?”Clarke finally turns her head to find Raven leaning over her shoulder, studying her drawing. She was so lost in it that she never even heard Raven come down the hallway. “I don’t know,” she admits. Raven just hums and starts up a pot of coffee.She and Raven have been friends for two years. They ended up living together when they realized Raven’s live-in boyfriend was also dating Clarke. It wasn’t an easy transition from jilted ex-lovers to friends, but they’ve reached the point where they’re friends first and Finn is just a distant memory.However, Clarke hasn’t told Raven, or anyone—except for Wells—about her drawings. And she only told him because he caught her drawing the face when she first started, when they were just little kids.“I’ve been drawing this same face since I was, like, four,” she explains and Raven turns slowly, like she’s starting to understand what’s going on. “This is the best I’ve ever done. He looks… real.”“What do you think it means?” Raven asks her carefully and Clarke is having a hard time reading her tone.The two of them have never talked about soulmates. She always just assumed it was because Raven didn’t have one. Or that Raven assumed the same about her. Neither of them have any visual soul marks on their bodies, so it’s an easy assumption to make. And because soulmates aren’t guaranteed—or even completely understood—Clarke doesn’t share what she believes is her soulmate connection with anyone.“I think it could mean a lot,” she finally says and they both laugh because the thought seems so unbelievable. Soulmates. Raven slides into the seat across the table from her and touches the top of Clarke’s sketchbook. Clarke pushes it toward her just enough to let her know she can look through it.The book isn’t just that same face over and over. There are some other sketches thrown in there, too. But she’s been so busy with school and work that hasn’t had much time for her own art and the book is full of sketches she’s done over the past two years. The face takes up more than half of the filled pages, though.Raven starts at the beginning and stops to inspect each iteration of Clarke’s could-be soulmate. She ignores the beeping of the coffee machine, so Clarke gets up and pours them both a cup while Raven keeps flipping through the pages. When Clarke sits back down, Raven is looking at the face Clarke drew three months ago. The differences between that and the one she finished are even starker than Clarke originally thought.“Wow,” Raven says, pushing the book across the table and trading it for her coffee cup. “He’s hot.”“He is, right?”“Really hot,” Raven promises and Clarke smiles into her coffee cup as she takes a sip. “I hope you get to meet him.”“I never thought I would,” she says quietly and Raven nods, almost like she understands. “Do you have one? We’ve never talked about it and I know it’s rude to ask, but—““Nope,” Raven answers, cutting off Clarke’s rambling. “Neither did Finn, so I kind of always thought he was mine. Like we were two leftover people that weren’t bound by fate to anyone else. I thought we got to choose who we loved. I thought we chose each other.”Clarke feels guilty every single time the subject of Finn comes up, but never more than this moment. She slept with and fell in love with the one person Raven chose to love. The only one she’s ever chosen. “I’m sorry,” she says for the thousandth time and she means it. She always means it.“It’s not your fault. You didn’t know. And it clearly wasn’t meant to be. We were young and I was naïve. You didn’t do anything wrong. You just fell in love.”Clarke smiles tightly and nods, closing the book in front of her. “I’ve got to get to work.”“Did you even sleep?” Raven asks her and Clarke laughs until it turns into a yawn. “So, no?”“Not really, but if I don’t serve coffee, who will?”“Octavia? Monty? Literally anyone else you work with?” Raven asks, but Clarke just shrugs. She needs the money. She can sleep later. “Okay. But do you mind if I come with you? I can’t work here anymore. I get too distracted by the internet and TV.”“The café has wifi, you know,” Clarke reminds her, but Raven just narrows her eyes, waiting for an answer. “But of course you can.”–The café is quiet, like it always is, because it’s a Thursday in July in a pretty small college town, but Clarke keeps herself busy. She brought her sketchbook with her and starts another drawing of the same face. She’s never done two so close together, but something told her to bring the book and a pencil. And because she is desperate to know more about this face and what it could mean, she listens to that impulse.Raven is the only constant in the café, so it’s easy—and forgivable—for Clarke to get lost in this new drawing. She does have to stop every so often when she hears the bell above the door jingle, but not for longer than a drink and a pastry order. It’s an easy day, work wise, but Clarke’s mind is running nonstop.She’s able to put the pencil down when she’s got a rough outline of his face done because the door swings open with a flourish. “You’re not working today,” she accuses Octavia and she sighs dramatically. “What’s wrong?”“My brother is meeting me here.” She says it like she’s waiting for the devil himself to walk through the door.“I didn’t even know you had a brother,” Raven says pointedly. Clarke didn’t know either, but it’s not a surprise. She and Octavia aren’t all that close. They had a few classes together in school and work together, but that’s the extent of their relationship. Octavia’s not a sharer. There’s no reason either Clarke or Raven would have known she has a brother.“That’s because we’re not really close anymore. He always acted more like a dad than an older brother and I finally couldn’t take it anymore once high school came around,” Octavia admits. She almost looks regretful, but not quite. “This is the first summer since I started college that I’m not going home, so he asked if he could come visit for a long weekend.”“And you said yes.”“I kinda miss him,” she shrugs before sitting at a table alone, facing the door. “He’s meeting me here so he can see where I work.”While Raven rolls her eyes and goes back to her computer, Clarke leans over her sketchbook, but turns back the page to look at the drawing she finished this morning. She studies the face again and feels her smile growing ever so slightly. How can someone she doesn’t even know—who might not even exist—make her this happy? How does she know that she’d fall for him if ever given the chance to meet him?“This is crazy,” she says, mostly to herself, just as the door opens. “It doesn’t make any— holy shit.”Raven looks up at that and finds Clarke staring at whoever just walked through the door. Clarke can’t believe it.“Holy shit,” Raven echoes and Clarke finally looks away to make sure Raven is seeing exactly what she is. She definitely is. “Clarke…”“I know,” she says, but she can’t look back toward the door. Not even when Monty comes in whistling. Not even when Octavia’s brother is standing right in front of her, ignoring his sister almost completely. She just keeps her eyes trained on Raven. She knows Raven. Raven makes all the sense in the world. What’s waiting for her when she turns her head makes no sense.“Clarke.” Raven says it more forcefully now, eyeing the man standing at the counter. Clarke can hear Monty putting on his apron and she feels him trying to read the situation.“Can you say that again?” Octavia’s brother asks and Octavia lets out girlish laugh—unlike anything Clarke has ever heard come out of her.“Clarke!” Raven says it again, standing up to really make her point. And Clarke knows she’s right. She knows she should look at him. He asked her a question. Not one she completely understands, but still. She’s being rude.“Say what?” Clarke asks, finally looking at him again. Up close he’s even more handsome than when she saw him walk through the door. Way more beautiful than he appears her sketchbook.Her soulmate?“Say what you said when I walked inside,” he begs her. “Please.”“Okay,” Clarke says, but she’s not really sure why he wants to hear it. “I was going to say that it doesn’t make any sense, but then I, um, I saw you.”He doesn’t look pleased. In fact, he almost looks annoyed with her. But when his eyes fall to the notebook on the counter, he goes pale and reaches back for Octavia.“That’s you,” she says, reaching for the book almost on instinct, but Clarke closes it quickly and pulls it back against her chest. “You don’t know my brother, but that’s his face. It’s you.”“Monty, can you cover for me while I take a break?” Clarke asks. She can’t stand there, looking at that face while Octavia says monumental things like that while she’s wearing her stupid apron.“Yeah…”“Thanks.” Clarke takes off her apron and tosses it under the counter before walking around to the dining room. Raven is watching her closely, like she’s ready to pounce at any moment if needed. But the closer Clarke gets to this person, the more at ease she feels. Even if none of it makes sense.“You said, ‘It doesn’t make any— holy shit,’” he tells her and she nods. Then he starts unbuttoning his shirt, never taking his eyes off of her, and Clarke has even less of an idea of what’s happening.“Jeez, Bellamy, at least warn the girl,” Octavia says with a sigh and a shake of her head.Bellamy. Clarke likes the sound of that. She’d repeat it out loud just to see how it feels if he wasn’t taking his shirt off in the middle of a café.He only pulls one arm down once it’s unbuttoned and just enough for her to see something written on his bicep. A tattoo.A tattoo that says, “It doesn’t make any— holy shit.”“So, it is what I thought,” she says, reaching to trace the tattoo before she remembers that she doesn’t even know this person. Soulmate or not, she can’t just grope his arm.“Looks that way,” he says and when she looks back at his face, he’s smirking just slightly—like she’d drawn on his face that morning. His glasses are a little askew—like she’d drawn that morning—and it’s all very charming.“I’m really sorry you have to live with that stupid half sentence and compulsory curse word on your arm for the rest of your life,” she tells him because she really doesn’t know what else to say. And when he laughs, she smiles back at him like it’s the most natural thing in the world.“I’m Bellamy.” He holds his hand out for her to shake and when she grabs it, she swears there’s an electric current running through her whole body.“I’m Clarke.” She’s still holding his hand—no longer shaking it, just… holding it. But he doesn’t let go either.“I can’t believe this is happening,” Octavia says and for the first time in minutes, Clarke remembers there are other people watching them. “I can’t believe it’s Clarke.” That girlish giggle erupts from her again and Clarke realizes that she’s happy. Hell, she’s delighted.And Bellamy looks pretty delighted, too.–Eventually, Clarke had to get back to work and Octavia and Bellamy needed to leave to café. In the hours that have passed, she’s been finishing up the sketch she’d started just before she met him. Her soulmate.Monty and Raven couldn’t stop freaking out. They didn’t know of anyone else at school who’d found their soulmates. They definitely weren’t there to witness it. Clarke still wasn’t quite able to form a coherent sentence herself, so she let them go on and on until Raven eventually left. But, then she let Monty go on and on by himself.He has a soulmate and the mark to prove it, but he’s never met them. He knows nothing about them. Clarke was lucky in that way. This whole time she knew what he looked like. She’d basically watched him grow up in her sketchbooks.She didn’t learn much before he had to leave to meet Octavia’s boyfriend for lunch, but she now knew he was twenty-eight. He was finishing up his own degree to become a teacher. And he had a voice so deep she felt it almost more than she heard it.“So, are you going to meet up with Bellamy before he leaves?” Monty asks her as she’s getting ready to leave at the end of her shift.“You heard our entire conversation. You know as much as I do.”“Well, then, I can’t believe you didn’t make any plans.”She honestly can’t believe it either. She’s been waiting to meet him since she first started drawing his face, nineteen years ago. They should have made some kind of plan, even if it included Octavia and Lincoln. Anything would be better than the nothing they came up with.When she leaves the café, she’s tempted to just text Octavia and ask for Bellamy’s number, but when she turns the corner toward her apartment, she sees him walking toward her.“I was just about to text your sister,” she tells him and he smiles, almost shyly. “This is better.”“I don’t know how to do this,” he admits and she nods. She’s never met her soulmate before either. She has no idea how it works. “I don’t know how we’re supposed to live our lives now, knowing what we know. I never really planned to meet you. So many people live without their soulmates, you know? I always just figured I would be one of them.”“I’m glad you’re not,” she says and he smiles again before looking down at the ground. “I mean, I always knew you were hot, but it’s way better in real life.”“Yeah, I didn’t know what you looked like, but I always liked that you weren’t afraid to swear,” he says with a laugh. “And it doesn’t hurt at all that you ended up being hot either.”Clarke laughs and takes a small step closer to him. It’s almost like she can’t help it.  “Shouldn’t you be with your sister or something?”“She’s happy that I met you,” he admits. “She thinks it’ll get me off of her back, so I promise she doesn’t mind that I’m here.”“So, then will she mind if you come to my place and have dinner? Because I’m starving.”“Then we should go to your place,” he says and she leads him toward her apartment. After just a few steps, she feels his hand envelope hers and she squeezes it just to make sure it’s all really happening.And it is." True text

The world might not be perfect, but he is, and he’s convinced that she is, too, so it has to work.Basically super fluffy Bellarke morning sex. a/n: Someone on Tumblr (I’m so sorry that I can’t remember who! My brain is mush!) asked me for sleepy Bellarke, and I had to post this! [AO3] When Clarke wakes up, she smiles at the feeling of strong arms wrapping around her waist and pulling her against a firm chest that she seems to fit so perfectly against. She sighs contentedly, and Bellamy nuzzles against her shoulder, breathing in the scent of her and pressing a soft kiss to the side of her neck.“Good morning,” he mumbles sleepily, and if she could only ever hear one sound again for the rest of her life, it would be the sound of his voice, hoarse from sleep and disuse, quiet enough so that she’s knows he’s speaking only to her. “Morning,” she answers with a smile, running her foot up the inside of his calf.It’s been too long since she felt this happy, this comfortable. “Sleep well?” he asks, and she can feel his smile on her skin, one that matches hers, as he presses teasing, barely-there kisses to her shoulder. She mumbles an assent, unable to find her voice as he brushes her hair aside and his mouth finds that spot just below her ear that has her arching back into him, desperate for more. He groans against her skin, his teeth nipping at her, and his arm tightening around her waist as she grinds against his obvious arousal. “Fuck, Clarke,” he mumbles, so she rubs back on him again for good measure.One of his hands darts under her tank top and starts exploring the expanse of bare skin he finds there, while the others easily slips beneath the waist band of the black scrap of lace she wears, his finger dancing around where she wants him, where she needs him, but he never quite touches the point that will undo her. His mouth becomes hungrier against her neck as his fingers find one of her nipples. She turns her head, searching for his lips, and he meets her in a slow, easy kiss, his tongue swiping along the seam of her mouth, begging for entrance.She lets him in, and she bites his lip, taking it into her mouth when his thumb and index tweak the nipple he’d been playing with. The fingers of his other hand flex against her hip, urging her to turn around. She does, and lying on her side, chest to chest with him, he can deepen the kiss. His hand slides down her body, over the curve of her ass, where he can’t help but squeeze, pushing her harder against his growing erection. He continues exploring down the length of her, playing with the soft fabric of her tiny sleep shorts, and he hides a chuckle against her mouth, one she swallows as she cards her hands through his hair. They’re both so happy, but too stubborn to say the words out loud. When his fingers can wrap around the back of her thigh, he hikes her leg over his hip, leaving not a whisper of space between them, and they lie there, his hand brushing up and down along the divots of her spine, trading slow, messy kisses and stale morning breath, bathed in sunlight while Seattle comes to life just outside of his apartment window.When they eventually break apart, both lying on their sides, heads pillowed on their arms, Bellamy looks at Clarke with a smile on his face that could rival the sun shining outside. His hand radiates heat where it rests against the skin of her hip. There is  not a thing in the world that Clarke wouldn’t trade to wake up every morning in his arms, to feel like she finally belongs. “So,” she starts, her fingers tracing patterns up and down his arm. She presses a light kiss to his chest before continuing. “Last night was -” Read the rest on [AO3] " False text

Slowly, he dragged his eyes from the bullet hole to her face.  Her eyes were dark, cold pits, fear and sadness etched into the creases in her forehead.  “What are you doing?” he asked, his ears still ringing.  His vision tunneled as he stared at the gun. The gun in Clarke’s hand. The gun pointed at him. “What I have to.  Like always,” she replied.  The gun was trembling but her jaw was set.  Determined. Determined to shoot him. “Octavia’s out there,” he pleaded.  “She’s— she’s out there.  You can’t expect me to—” “– if you open that door, we die,” Clarke interrupted.  “All of us.  I can’t let that happen.” “You don’t know that.” “I do,” she said, her voice breaking.  Tears filled her eyes but didn’t fall.  “After what I did— they’ll kill us for it.  I have no choice.  This is…this is who I need to be.” The words landed like a body blow.  He’d said that to her once in a vain attempt at comfort and hearing them now sent ice down his spine.  But her hand was still shaking and a tear fell, so he took a step down and then another.  “Then do it,” he said, thankful his voice was steady.  His heart was cracking in two but he sounded sure; certain. “Bellamy,” she whispered. “You know I won’t leave her out there.  So do it,” he urged.  “This is who you need to be, right?  If you believe that, then do it.  Kill me.” “Bellamy, please,” she repeated. “You have no choice,” he spat.  He reached the floor but she didn’t lower the gun, just swallowed hard.  “And neither do I.  That’s my sister out there.  So if you’re going to shoot me, shoot me.”   He walked towards her and Clarke shook her head in despair.  “Don’t do this, please.  You know— you know I can’t.  I need you.” “Do you?”  His mind was clearing now, disbelief giving way to anger.  You need me?  You left me.  And now you might kill me. “I do,” she said, and it sounded like a sob.  He drew closer, the gun still between them.  “You know I do.  I— I made sure you were safe.  I couldn’t do this without you.”  She took a shuddering breath.  “I love you,” she said, and it felt like a slap. In another life those words might have brought him joy, but now they just pissed him off.  “Then choose,” he growled, and stepped right up to her.  The barrel of the gun pressed into his sternum; cold and hard and deadly.  “Do it, or let me save my sister.”   Clarke met his gaze and he saw his death flicker there.  He swallowed, not letting himself break, and wondered if she’d do it.  A tear tracked down her cheek, then another and then another.  And then the moment passed.  “They’ll kill us,” she protested, but Bellamy just wrapped his hand around hers and slowly tugged the gun away from his chest.  It clattered to the floor and they collapsed into one another, Clarke’s face mashing against his shoulder and his arms coming up to hold her.  The anger that had flared in his gut dimmed— not yet cold ash, but no longer threatening to consume him.  Clarke sobbed and he felt his own tears start to fall fall.  “I did what I had to,” she kept murmuring, and he smoothed her hair down and nodded. Because this world wasn’t fair and never would be. " False text

He was already half way up the last set of stairs before he turned to look at her.  “Clarke, I already told you. I’m not leaving her out–”  He stopped talking the moment she lifted her gun and pointed it at him, a sight that left him speechless for a moment.  “What are you doing?” He asked, a wave of shock traveling through him.  She was quiet for a second, and he noticed how much her hand was shaking.  “What I have to.” She said, trying to keep her tone even.  He took a small step downward and another until he was off the stairs completely. “You can’t really believe that.” Her entire body wavered, but she didn’t lower her arm, even when he began moving closer toward her.  “If you don’t let me open that door, my sister will die.”  “You don’t even know if she’s still alive.” Clarke replied, her expression solemn.  “Which is why I have to find out… and you have to let me.” He was pleading with her, searching her eyes for the person he knew her to be.  “I… I can’t.” She shook her head, on the verge of tears. “I’m not doing this for me. I’m doing this for everyone. Sometimes sacrifices have to be made.”  “Then why didn’t you leave me out there with the rest of them? How do you decide whose worthy of being saved and who’s not?”  He reached out to her, and placed his hand partially on the gun, his fingers reaching her wrist.  “This is not who you are.” He echoed her own words back to her, and together they lowered her weapon.  Her face was wet with tears, and he pulled her into him, his arms wrapping tightly around her as her cheek rested against his chest.  “I’m sorry… I’m so sorry…” She squeezed her eyes shut. “I don’t know what to do. I can’t– I can’t bear it anymore, Bellamy. I don’t have the strength to.”  “It’s okay.” He was quiet, his hand smoothing down her hair. “I’ll lend you some of mine.”  She looked up at him and he looked down at her.  “We’re in this together, remember? Let me bear it with you.”  She smiled. It was small and it was sad, but it was still a smile and that’s all he had needed.  After a few more seconds, they pulled apart.  “Let’s go get your sister.” She finally said, and now it was Bellamy’s turn to smile.  " False text

One minute they were discussing how they might be able to start building more permanent homes now that things were calm for the moment and the next they were screaming at each other. It wasn’t an unusual thing for the two to disagree or even to argue, but lately there had been so much tension between the two that they always seemed to end up screaming at one another. Their friends had learned that once things started heating up it was time for them to leave. The first time it had happened Monty had tried to play peacemaker between the two and they had ended up screaming at him instead. They’d both felt terrible afterwards and every time it happened, they promised that they would do better. And yet, here they were again. “I don’t have to like your ideas, Princess. It’s not a requirement that I agree with you all the time.” Clarke laughed. “You never seem to agree with me anymore. It’s like you decide your opinion solely based on the fact that it’s the opposite of mine.” “That’s bullshit.” Bellamy shook his head. “You’re the one that always seems to want to fight. What’s wrong? Now that there’s no war, no people to kill, you’re bored?” Clarke froze, not believing her ears. She shook her head, most of the anger draining from her and leaving behind a deep pit of hurt. She fought back the tears as she slammed her palm against Bellamy’s chest and pushed him back. “Fuck you, Bellamy!” She turned and started to head towards the door, just now noticing that their friends had once again left them. “Yeah, I wish you would.” His tone was yearning and the words were soft, so soft that she wasn’t sure if she had heard him correctly.

It’s a silly thought. Bellamy is also not the type of person who becomes a boyfriend in the first place. And she’s not the type, either, to form vague romantic fantasies—certainly not about assholes like him.  He’s probably the type who barely acknowledges the relationship. He’s probably the type who’s gruff in public, not demonstrative; who maybe, every now and then, will place a hand to her back just to let someone else know: hey, she’s taken, and that’s all. But then in private he’s harsh kisses and sex standing up, her back against the wall, her legs around his waist. Biting kisses instead of sweet kisses. And not a talker. Not a sweet talker, not much for words at all.  She’s so sure of all of this that when he does kiss her, and it is sweet, and gentle, and soft, she’s more taken aback by the careful way he lets his palm rest against her cheek than by the kiss itself. She doesn’t quite kiss back. But she doesn’t pull away. So for a long moment they just sit there side by side next to the dying fire, their knees touching, their lips touching, statue-still like they’re posing for a tableau.  Then Bellamy pulls away, and just stares at her, blinking slowly.  Keep reading " False text

When some of the grounder clans won’t stop attacking the people of the Ark, they turn to the commander for a truce. The solution? An arranged marriage between the young and promising leader Bellamy Blake, and the Trigedakru’s own warrior and member of Lexa’s inner circle, Clarke. It’s just a business arrangement. Right?Chapter 4 - start from the beginning  It was easier after that, less tense. The ice between them had been broken, and they were both glad of it. They talked a little more, and they didn’t stay so far on their own sides of the bed at night. It was too cold to bother with that most nights anyway. Things at Clarke’s village carried on as usual, and before they knew it, they’d been married for a month and were packing up for Arkadia. Octavia and Lincoln would be coming with them. “Why couldn’t you two be the marriage for the treaty?” Bellamy grumbled to them just before they left. Lincoln laughed softly. “Because I’m hardly a grounder, and Octavia’s hardly a sky person. They know better.”He was right–he and Octavia were often off on their own, since neither one of them felt completely comfortable at either place. Clarke arrived with their horses loaded up with their packs, one for each couple since her village wouldn’t spare more, and they set off. They reached Arkadia by sundown, and had barely gotten inside Bellamy’s cabin, now their cabin, when it was flooded by a steady stream of people checking in to update him on the happenings of camp. Miller was first, to brief him on security, but everyone from farmers to children came to tell him about their month. Some even thanked him for securing the treaty. He introduced them to Clarke, his mouth sticking on the word “wife” with a little difficulty. She smiled warmly at them all. [read it on ao3]  " False text

She lives closer to his station than he does, and sometimes he’s exhausted when he gets off his shifts at weird times, so he drives to Clarke’s place and passes out on her couch, which is admittedly very comfortable. She doesn’t mind. Bellamy’s her best friend, and she likes having him around. Plus, he sees a lot of shit, working for the LA Fire Department, and Clarke knows he needs to decompress after some of it, and he shouldn’t be alone with his thoughts. They watch Netflix or play video games or make food, and she’s happy to be the sunshine he needs after a hard shift. She gave him his own key after a while, so he can get in right away if she isn’t home at the moment, so she’s not surprised when she wakes up at two in the morning to the sounds of her front door shutting, the deadbolt sliding back into place, and heavy steps ambling around her kitchen. “Bell, is that you?” she calls.

(she doesn't’ even go here)  Here on AO3 “Don’t you dare look,” Octavia growled bringing Bellamy’s eyes back up to hers. Curiosity had gotten the better of him for a half second but he snapped out of it as she gripped his hand harder. He was at her side, his other arm was holding her leg up hooked under her knee and Clarke was at the end of the table. Her face concentrated. “One more push, Octavia, just give me one more,” Clarke said and Bellamy felt Octavia’s muscles tense. This wasn’t like when Octavia was born, even if years had dulled the memories, he knew this was different, better. “Now, Octavia, push,” Clarke said before she started counting. Lincoln should be here, but he was gone. Two weeks ago they’d gone out on a routine meeting. Clarke and Bellamy could have done it without him, but this clan had a particular dialect that neither of them had managed to get quite right and they were sticklers for protocol and tradition so he’d volunteered. It was going to be three hours. No big deal. Octavia wanted to come but she’d been having contractions and Abby refused to let her go. There was a storm and he’d fallen off the side of the trail, then a mudslide and he was gone. They’d been searching for the past two weeks but he was gone. Octavia was a mess. She was angry with everyone. Bellamy knew eventually the anger would be overcome by grief but so far she was still livid. Even in labor, when her water broke she cursed and tried to punch him every time he offered assistance in getting her to medical. Octavia screamed like a banshee when Abby tried to touch her, claiming if she’d not put her on bed rest, Octavia would have been able to save Lincoln. Clarke heard the gossip around camp that Octavia was in labor and came running just in time to see Octavia to throw a tray at Abby. “I got it, mom,” Clarke offered and now she was down there, covered in more blood than Bellamy saw when he brought down a deer. He choked back his concern and remembered that his mother did this and survived without a doctor, Octavia was fine and in good hands. Women were badass. “Good, good, good,” Clarke said and her tone and the sudden loosening of Octavia’s grip had Bellamy looking at Clarke for confirmation. “It’s a boy.” She lifted the baby up and placed the bloody mess of goo and tiny person on Octavia’s chest. Bellamy was in awe, Clarke was smiling, and Octavia started to sob. But it wasn’t happy tears. She looked away and Clarke yelled for Jackson. Keep reading " False text

For a short time in her last year of secondary school, the year before she started her internship, two years before her father was floated and she was put in the skybox, there was widespread unrest on the Ark. Every year she could remember there was unrest, but this particular year, hers and Wells’ lives were threatened specifically. So for several months they both were guarded around the clock. And because many of the guards were found to be sympathizers of the opposing party, well, of course, there were only about four guards that worked the details. One of them was Bellamy Blake and Clarke spent a ridiculous amount of time keeping her blush under control and telling Wells that he was imagining her fidgeting. It was a schoolgirl crush and Clarke knew she made a fool of herself on a few occasions. “Is the paperwork to your liking,” her mother prodded. Clarke looked up from the info pad and gave her a look. “Looks like your standard ‘how to stop a coup before we run out of air’ type agreement.” She wasn’t sure but she thought she saw Bellamy Blake bite his lip to stop a laugh from escaping. It was out of her periphery, she was having some nostalgic feelings from school, and she couldn’t spare him a glance, she had to stare down her mother, but well, maybe. “Clarke,” her mother scolded her like she wasn’t an adult with a dead husband, and a child, like she wasn’t about to be used again for her mother’s political gain. “Do you want to step outside?” “No, Chancellor,” Clarke said with an air of condescension. “The paperwork looks fine. But I hope you’re going to buy us some new sheets or a punch bowl for the trouble.” This time she was sure that Bellamy Blake snorted. His own representative, an older leader from factory station, sighed. “And you, Mr. Blake?” Clarke’s mother turned now to him. He shrugged. “I’d rather have new sheets. Punch bowls seem like an upper class thing and I can’t fathom when we’d ever use one. But I guess there will be parties now, huh? Do we have to have parties to show everything is happy and everyone is smiling?” “People know this isn’t a marriage of love, you aren’t expected to put on a show,” the leader from factory station cut in. “Sure, sure, but it looks better if we smile. I thought everyone from this side of the Ark was all about pomp and circumstance,” Bellamy replied looking pointedly at Clarke. Now she was irritated. It was always about the haves and the have-nots with people from any section below 5. “We’re running out of air, the secret is out and our children and our parents’ lives are in danger.” Jake Griffin’s calculations were off by 10 years and Clarke was angry about the injustice of it all over again. “My mother was floated already, as well as my wife, that’s why we’re sitting here right now. She was falsely convicted and you’re the only apology this sham of a government can come up with. ” “Could float you too, that would tidy up the problem nicely, but since you’re popular down there in Section 17, despite not wanting to take a bullet for my mother’s mistakes, I’m here. For everyone’s good. To get us all to the ground without a coup by Diana Sydney.” “Diana Sydney is who you should be floating,” Bellamy muttered under his breath. “There’s no hard evidence for that,” Abby said from the spot behind her desk. They could only guess that she framed Bellamy Blake’s first wife. “So this is the new plan. We make you look appealing, and you overtake her in the election for council member.” “And I don’t tell everyone that you floated a completely innocent woman for a crime she didn’t commit, right?” Something about Bellamy didn’t sound like a grieving man or even one that was angry with his wife’s killer. “That’s line six or seven in the papers, didn’t you read it?” Clarke couldn’t help herself from asking needing to try and solve the puzzle of his odd tone. He turned to her, face closed off. “I did, but I’m not an idiot, I’m going to continue to remind your mother of this every chance I get, just so we’re clear.” “She prefers to be called Chancellor,” Clarke said with a tilt of her head. “She got my father floated, I prefer you call her that.” Bellamy sucked in air baring his teeth as though he was in some sarcastic display of pain. “Heard the rumors but I didn’t think they were actually true.” He turned to the Chancellor who was barely concealing her annoyance at Clarke. “Enough,” she said lifting her hands to slam on the desk, but seeming to remember herself at the last moment, gently placing her hands on the desk instead. “You’re the only one who can beat Diana Sydney in an election for her spot on the council. Clarke is going to take Kane’s seat, and the two of you can remind people on this ship that things are equal, anyone can flourish, you’ll be an adequate distraction while we try to get everyone to the ground. Sign the papers and get out of my office.” “When are my new sheets going to be delivered?” Clarke spoke up knowing the wrath she was incurring. “Honey, our new sheets,” Bellamy said with a smirk.   “Right, sweetheart, our new sheets,” Clarke corrected, returning the smile.

Staff meetings usually end up like this, discussing whatever topics Jaha can recall or make up off the top of his head, until Vera inevitably fills the silence with updates on her pet programs nobody else wants that many details about (seriously, Bellamy is as big a fan of trees as the next person, but her Saturday morning wellness group is starting to sound more and more like a cult), and Luna sitting passively by, diligently taking notes and refusing to exchange even the slightest expression of mutual understanding that Bellamy shoots her way. Don’t get him wrong; Bellamy likes his coworkers. It’s not the tight-knit, found-family feel Leslie Knope had prepared him for when he got hired to his small town’s Parks & Recreation division, but they each care a lot, in their own way. All of his favorite people care way too much about stuff. It’s what he likes in a person. And he does like parks. Arcadia has some pretty nice ones, clean and well-kept with cool signs about historical things that happened nearby and/or noteworthy plant species. Not to mention that time last year he got to quash a movement for a confederate monument. That was one of his finer moments, if he does say so himself. Mostly, he took the job to get a foot in the door of local government, but the soft spot he’s always harbored for parks– free, accessible, fairly safe spaces for him and Octavia to hang out in when they didn’t want to be at home, growing up– is what clinched the deal. Still. Staff meetings are the worst. He’s in the middle of wondering whether anyone is going to eat the last bagel Luna brought in, and also whether it has hemp in it, when Jaha says his name. He blinks, looking up, and finds everyone staring at him. “Sorry. I zoned out for a second. What’s up?” “I was saying I have a special project for you,” says Jaha, and Bellamy groans inwardly.

Enjoy! Also on AO3   i. Rain doesn’t stop pouring on the day of Jake Griffin’s funeral and Clarke Griffin doesn’t stop running.  Wide laps, one foot in front of the other, clenching her fists as her hair brushes her skin. Every inch of her body is on fire, muscles screaming in agony, and whenever she feels a pang in her chest, she just goes faster. Her dad used to say that she pushes herself too hard. He always said it like it was a bad thing but it’s really, really not. It’s the only thing keeping her alive when they’re placing his body in the cold ground four hundred miles to the east from her college. “Hey, Princess!” The name reverberates in her head, in her hollow bones. She’s running to run away from that emptiness because it’s static, it’s not even calm. Just fuzzy nothingness. Bellamy keeps calling for her, Princess turns into Griffin into Clarke, but she doesn’t stop. After a while, he catches up with her, messy curls made messier by rain and wind hitting his face. It’s a very, very cold day for April. “Clarke, hey.” He brushes her forearm with his palm, warm and solid despite the rain. She doesn’t look at him because she guesses that, at least today, of all days, she doesn’t have to tolerate Bellamy Blake’s shit. “Clarke, what are you doing?” “Running.” Her eyes flick to him when she hears him snort and he looks amused. “Really? I couldn’t tell.” “Leave me alone.” “It’ll be a cold day in hell when I do that.” One foot in front of the other, grass brushing her ankles. The field is where she knows how to just be. The field is what she’s got. “Come on, Clarke, just stop running for a second.” A beat of silence, perturbed only by the sound of their footfalls. And then – “You’ll screw up your joints if you keep running.” Of course Bellamy Blake, the athletic trainer for Clarke’s team, knows how to make her stop. If she cares about one thing, it’s her body. She needs it for soccer, to feel more useful. Feel better, too, but that’s impossible. The static inside her chest is eating away at everything. She forces herself to look at him, averts her gaze when she meets the raw sympathy in his eyes. It’s not even pity and that’s what pisses her off. He doesn’t get to be nice today. “I heard about your dad,” he says. She’s aware of the car accident, of her mother calling in the middle of the night to tell her that Jake isn’t going to make it, but Bellamy saying it makes it feel more real. Her fingers bunch into fists again. “I’m sorry doesn’t cut it. It’s fucking horrible.” “Thank you,” she replies in a practiced voice. The downward curve of Bellamy’s mouth threatens to expose her cover. “Let me know if I can help. You can take days off practice, too, of course – “ “No. Let me play.” Bellamy blinks at her. “Are you sure?” “Yeah, I’m sure. I’m fine, don’t worry.” For a second, she thinks he might argue with her. That’s what they’re good at, that’s what would make her feel a little less empty. But he doesn’t. He just nods, says, “Alright, then.” and she starts running. Clarke doesn’t think she ever stops. ii. Her knee hurts like a bitch but she pushes away Harper, who’s trying to help her. Her jersey sticks to her skin in the wet heat of the day and she can almost hear Echo Isley gloating.  “Fucking – “ She’s hopping over to the bench, blowing away stray strands of hair falling into her face, when she feels another set of hands around her waist. When she looks up, ready to tell them to fuck off, she meets Bellamy Blake’s concerned gaze. “How’s your knee?” he asks, trying to support her, but Clarke doesn’t let him.  “It’s fine, don’t worry. Nothing’s broken, I just have to walk it off.” He raises his eyebrows instantly, letting out a bright laugh she’s not used to hearing from him during matches. “Let me be the judge of that.” They always fight about this, too. She tells him that he hovers and that she’ll be fine, and he just calmly replies that if there’s blood, he’s obligated to check. Fucking mother hen. Keep reading" False text

Praimfaya has nothing on his Clarke.His Clarke.Slowly, Bellamy pushes open the door to her room, expecting her to be asleep – it’s late, everyone else went to bed long ago – but no, she’s awake, reading on her bed. He taps on the doorframe and she looks up, surprised.“Oh, hey.” She flips the book closed and gets to her feet, smiling slightly. He can’t do much else than just stare back at her. She’s so much older, so much more grown up. Different, but heartbreakingly familiar, too…Clarke’s brow furrows and she takes a few steps closer. “What’s wrong?”Bellamy almost laughs. She can still read him like a book, just like she always could. Not even Octavia knew him that well. “That,” he says gruffly, pushing his fingers into his hair. “That is what’s wrong.”Clarke frowns and shakes her head slightly, not understanding. It’s exactly what she used to do whenever she was confused, and that’s when Bellamy knows he just can’t handle it any longer.“It’s you,” he says before she can ask. “It’s everything about you. Fuck, I can’t do this…”“What are you talking about?”“It just—” He sighs and leans on the doorframe. “Six years is a hell of a separation.”Her face softens. “Yeah, I know. Trust me.”There’s a short pause. Bellamy opens his mouth, but nothing comes out. There are too many emotions and not enough words in the world to describe them.“You know, I thought about you every single day,” he blurts out.Clarke’s lips part and she steps even closer. “Bellamy…”“Every single day,” he insists. “Even thinking you were dead. I just – I couldn’t not think about you.”He holds her gaze, feeling something well up inside of him. “I still can’t.”Clarke doesn’t say anything for a long moment, just looks at him with wide blue eyes and an expression on her face that he can’t quite place. Bellamy tenses, thinking for a moment that he’s said something wrong. Stepped over an invisible boundary. “Shit, I’m sor—”Before he can finish his apology, Clarke surges forward and kisses him.He’s shocked at first, but he’s not a total idiot, so he cups her face almost immediately and kisses her back. It’s soft, gentle, but with no shortage of passion. They kiss with all the emotions they’ve been holding back for years, pouring everything into each other.Bellamy finally pulls back after what feels like years and presses his forehead into hers, keeping his eyes closed. A goofy smile works its way onto his face.“Took us long enough, huh?” Clarke asks, her fingers curling into his hair, and he can tell she’s smiling too.“Yeah.” He enters the bedroom, kicks the door closed behind him. “This is long overdue.”" True text

Timing was never his strong suit. Bellamy had realized he was in love with his coworker the week before she got engaged.  He kissed her the last day they worked together and found out Clarke had called off the engagement three weeks after he left town because the universe hated him. He’d done his best to move on anyway, because she had his number and she didn’t call and he knew what that meant.  And for awhile, it worked.  Gina was cute and funny and into him and single, and it was nice to be with someone instead of pining after them from afar.  There wasn’t any drama, just nice nights on the couch with a bottle of wine and laughter. But because the universe had it out for him, no sooner had he and Gina gotten to a good place than the Polis and Arkadia branches were merged.  Gina took the buyout and then and he was right back where he’d started— at a desk six yards from Clarke, massively and impossibly in love.   He could manage it just fine most days— he had years of practice, after all— but when Wallace threw one of his ridiculous and mandatory parties his thin veneer of control would crack.  Clarke would snort into her gin and tonic and he’d be seized with a desire to kiss her, so it was best if he just stayed away.   He waited until everyone was absorbed in their drinks to grab his jacket and slip out.  He was just two steps from his car when the office door opened behind him.  “You’re not supposed to leave until you’ve played at least two rounds of Uno,” Clarke called. Bellamy smiled in spite of himself.  “Somehow, I think I’ll manage to not get fired.” “Come on, I was planning on using a draw four on you specifically.  You’ve gotta give me a chance to at least do that,” Clarke wheedled. “There’s no guarantee you’d even get that card,” he said and turned around.  Clarke was standing right in front of him, closer than they’d been since the night he kissed her. “I have my ways,” she said with a grin. “That’s called cheating.” “That’s called strategy.  And maybe some cheating,” she replied. He felt his own smile fade.  “I should go,” he said quietly. “Why?”   Because I kissed you and then you called off your engagement and never called mee.  Because it’s obvious you don’t have the same feelings I have for you.  Because this is hopeless and it’s better if I just leave.  “Because,” he said instead.  “I…I just have to.” Clarke sobered.  “I was so glad when you came back,” she said in a tiny voice.  “I missed you.  Don’t go.  Not yet, anyway.” “I have to,” he said again.  “Just…let me go, okay?” His words landed on her and she set her jaw.  “Never,” she said fiercely, and then she was kissing him and maybe the universe hated him and maybe his timing had never been right, but for once everything fell into place.

There she was, Raven Reyes, the youngest Zero G-Mechanic in 52 years, the woman who’d gotten them all out of more scrapes than they could count, the brilliant badass with a heart of gold. Raven spied her just a moment later. She stood up, shaking, not believing her eyes.“Clarke is that you? Oh my god…” her words caught in her throat, and she lunged forward but Clarke was already hurtling towards her down the shallow embankment. She lurched into Raven’s arms, almost knocking her over with the force of her embrace. “Oh my god…” Raven breathed into her hair, holding onto Clarke as tightly as Clarke was hugging her. “You’re alive. The night blood worked. You’re…alive!”Clarke laughed through her tears. “You’re alive too…when I didn’t hear from anyone all this time, I wasn’t sure…but I knew, I just knew you had to be alive.” She pulled back to look at her friend. “I missed you. So much. But you came back.”Raven grinned, and ran a hand over her glistening check. “Just returning the favor, a few years late.”“Where are the others? Bellamy?”“They went out on a scouting mission a few hours ago, I stayed behind to work on the water purifying system—”Clarke heard a noise behind her and before she turned she knew. Behind her, heading into the clearing: Monty and Harper, Echo, Murphy and Emori hand in hand, and him. Bellamy. The look on his face broke her heart. He was older, thinner than she remembered, his freckles standing in stark relief to his untanned skin. He hung behind for a moment while the others all rushed her at once, hugging and yelling (even Echo, and somehow especially Emori). Then they parted to let her through. Her legs trembled as she closed the distance between them, as if she was propelled by an outside force. She stood a few feet from him, gazing up into his tear filled eyes. “I told you to hurry,” she joked, a tremor in her voice. He opened his mouth to speak, but instead reached out to catch her in his arms. Her face was against his chest, and she breathed him in as if he were her oxygen. His arms clasped her tightly, then one hand moved to her hip and the other to her chin, tipping her face up.“Clarke, I—.” “I’ve missed the way you say that, my name.”He was kissing her the next moment, his tears mingling with her own, his mouth tasting sweeter than she could have ever imagined. He tangled a hand in her hair, and it would have hurt if it hadn’t been such a perfect way to ground her in that moment. He pulled back finally at the sound of the entire group cheering at them, and his face was transformed like she’d never seen it. He glowed with happiness.“About fucking time!” called Murphy, while Raven and the rest cackled with joy.2) ForgivenMadi had been annoyed when Clarke told her to stay and guard the rover, especially when there were potentially very exciting strangers camped just a few miles over. She sighed, adjusting the weight of the rifle on her lap. Then she heard it: a twig cracked in the woods not a hundred yards away. Madi hopped off the hood of the rover and glanced down the scope of the rifle. She saw them, the strangers—they were laughing loudly, recklessly. Madi pursed her lips in disapproval, but when she saw Clarke among them she lowered the weapon and began to advance, curious but confident. Clarke looked different, lighter and brighter somehow. She was hand in hand with a tall, dark haired man. Bellamy. Madi recognized him immediately from Clarke’s stories. There were six others behind them, and Madi was surprised she couldn’t tell the former Grounders from the Sky People. Clarke gave Bellamy’s hand a squeeze and gently dropped it, walking forward to meet Madi alone. “Hello, my little night blood. I told you they’d come back.”“I never doubted.” Madi replied in Trigedasleng, peering at the group behind Clarke.“So this is Madi?” Emori was the first to approach, followed closely by Murphy and Echo. They all made their introductions in turn. Madi was fascinated by every little thing about them, but she reserved her judgment in silence, only nodding or shaking her head in response to any questions. “She’s amazing,” Raven whispered to Clarke. “I can’t believe it.”Clarke nodded, but her eyes were fixed on Bellamy. He seemed overcome, and she knew he was thinking of his sister, wondering if she was alive. He finally approached Madi and extended his hand. “Hi, Madi. I’m Bellamy.”“I know who you are,” she replied, a little scornfully. “Clarke talked to you every day. Why didn’t you ever talk back?”Clarke could tell this pained him, but he chuckled regardless. “I didn’t know, I’m sorry. Our radio was broken.”“I thought Sky People were supposed to be smart,” Madi muttered to Clarke in Trigedasleng. Echo and Emori laughed, and Murphy cracked a smile. Madi seemed a little taken aback but pleased. She blushed, smiling. “We’ll do better, I promise,” Bellamy replied earnestly. “How can I try and make it up to you?”Madi stared directly at Clarke as she answered. “Did you kiss Clarke yet?”Clarke dropped her head to hide her laughter, and Bellamy’s color rose in his cheeks. “I did, in fact. I hope that’s alright.” Madi shrugged. “Alright, Bellamy. I will let you tell me a story and you will be forgiven.”“Little Grounder Princess,” Monty whispered to Harper, and she chuckled. “First, we should move to the new camp.” Clarke cut in, amused but ever practical. They all piled into the back of the rover, except Madi and Bellamy. Bellamy wasn’t about to let Clarke out of his sight. The little nightblood sat in front between them, reunited co-leaders of a recently expanded family unit.3) Stay Tuned“We’ve watched four seasons in one day. We’re pathetic.”“You’re sick and I’m keeping you company,” Bellamy argues.“True. I am sick,” she says, nudging her foot against his leg. “You’re pathetic.”“Netflix can judge me all it wants. I’m being a good friend.” He confirms with Netflix that they are indeed going to ‘Continue Watching’ Parks and Rec. “Ready for soup?”He’s been trying to get it down her throat since he got to her apartment and found her on the couch, useless and wrapped in a thousand blankets, half-delirious from too much cough syrup.When she groans and shakes her head, he pouts at her, makes his eyes extra big and puppy-like. “I made it just for you, Clarke.”That gets her attention. She props herself up to look at him better, noticing the way his ears have pinked. “You made it?”Bellamy ducks his head, like eye contact is suddenly a lot to deal with. “Well, yeah. Don’t act so surprised. I’m an adult. I can cook.”“And you did for me?”Bellamy sighs, long-suffering, as if someone had forced him to make soup for her. “Do you want it or not?”“Yes, please,” says Clarke as she settles back, nestled in her blankets, listening to the sounds Bellamy’s making in the kitchen. A sharp thought comes to her as he walks back over to the couch and kneels in front of her: I want this.It’s deceptively simple, this idea that’s rapidly taking hold and spinning pictures of a future with him into her mind: Sunday mornings reading the paper together in bed, walking their dogs together in the park, knowing each other’s cell phone passcodes.  She aches with how much she wants it.Him.  Bellamy smirks at her and holds out a spoon full of warm broth.“I can feed myself, Bellamy.”“Don’t want your fingers to get cold,” he says, nodding to the cocoon she’s wrapped herself in.After he’s fed her most of it, he pulls her socked feet into his lap and rubs them.“Do Ben and Leslie get married in season 5?”“Yea, I think so,” Clarke says, looking at him, not the screen.Bellamy nods, eyes set forward, rubbing at the ball of her foot. She’s had another dose of medicine. She feels wistful and a little crazy and she wants him.“Hey, Bell,” she says and if this goes badly she can blame it on the cough medicine.“Yea?”“When I’m feeling better, we should get married.”She might be drowsy as fuck, but his small smile is the most gorgeous thing she’s ever seen. “Yea, we could do that or we could just go on a date.”   “As long as there’s kissing involved. You’ve got a pretty mouth.”“Glad you think so.”  Clarke hums, her eyes drooping, vaguely thinking that Bellamy would be a lovely thing to see in the morning. “I’m gonna pass out now. Wake me up for the wedding episode.”“Okay, Princess.”4) His Heart Beats Only For Her“Did you tell her you loved her?”They’d been staring each other down; Murphy leaned against the door to Bellamy’s room, Bellamy sitting on the chair at his desk and turned towards Murphy.Bellamy clenches his jaw. “She knows. Knew.”“Everyone knows. I asked if you told her. She deserved to have heard it from you.”And it hurts. It hurts that Murphy is saying this, because he was able to convince himself before. Convince himself that she’d died knowing.For the first time, he wonders if she’d died not knowing she was loved.That she was everything to him. The only reason he got up in the morning, the only reason his heart beat, the only reason breathing wasn’t a knife slicing open his throat.He figures this wasn’t really Murphy’s intention. Maybe it was. He doesn’t know for sure (like he now doesn’t know about Clarke). Murphy may be a self-serving bastard, but he didn’t inflict pain where pain needn’t be.He probably asked because he thought that answer was yes.“Look,” Murphy sighs, obviously changing tactic because the last route hadn’t played the way he thought it would, “she might still be alive. The nightblood …”Bellamy stands abruptly, the chair pushing back and clattering to the floor.“So, what?” He spits. “She lives in fucking solitary? She’s by herself until she dies of starvation or offs herself because she’s gone mad with loneliness?” He throws the plastic cup he’d been drinking from, which doesn’t break and has no water in it, thank god. Wasting their small amount of resources would be another thing on his list of reasons of why he hates himself.“Or perhaps she lives through it all, somehow, and we get back and she hates me because I - … I left her behind, Murphy. I did. I made that call.”Murphy doesn’t say anything.“Would you have done that to Emori? Would she forgive you?”Murphy purses his lips. “You don’t want the answer to that, Bellamy.”Bellamy stares at him, then turns his head away. “Then fucking leave.”Murphy sighs, then turns to go.“You can’t hate yourself for five years over this, Bellamy.”Bellamy waits until he can’t see Murphy, can’t hear his footsteps.“Yes. I can.” 5) A Lazy Morning ReunionHe remembers kneeling, buckling with the relief of returning to his home.It wasn’t where he was born or where he grew up, but it was where he found himself.He remembers sifting a handful of dirt between his fingers, a giant grin on his face. When he closed his eyes the electronic buzz from the Arc was replaced by a soft wind rustling his curls and the melodic calls of birds. He felt heavier too, in a reassuring way. Once they had experienced gravity on the earth, the artificial gravitational pull from the Arc couldn’t compete.They knew the gravitational pull wasn’t a perfect simulation their second time on the Arc.But perhaps what he remembers with the greatest clarity is the simultaneous disbelief, hope, and what he can now recognise as love in her eyes when he looked up and saw her. All of a sudden he was enveloped by her. He could only register small details at a time: a smile, a curl in her hair, a familiar scent. It was all so…Clarke.Back then he gripped her as a lifeline, with an urgency even greater than after their separation when Clarke was taken by the Mountain Men. But now, there’s no need.In their tent he nuzzles her neck, leaving the odd press of lips to soft skin, and traces slow circles on the bare skin of her lower back. She gives a contented groan and an Eskimo kiss. But of course she couldn’t resist. She had to sneak a few pecks in, still not opening her eyes. He gently cards his fingers through her hair, kissing her forehead as she snuggles back into his chest, wrapping her arms around his waist. He intertwines their legs again, and they both soak in the comforting solace from the outside world.He knew he loved her for a long time before, but her daily transmissions showed him both how helpless he was as he hung onto her every word, unable to reply, but also gave him hope, for the first time, that maybe a future like this would be possible, someday.She groans again.“I have to get up,” she begrudges.“No,” he pleads. “Stay, just for a little longer. Maddie can wait. She’s had you for five years and it’s my turn now.” He grips onto her and starts planting lazy kisses over wherever he can find her skin. “It’s our turn.”“Ugh. Now I definitely have to get up. You’re so sappy.” But her fond tone and the way she holds him tighter proves the opposite.“Please. Please. Please.”“I have to.”“Pleeeeeeeeease,” he whispers in her ear.“Who knew you were such a softie?”“You did.”“You’re right, but that is so sickenly loved up that I’m just going to have to stay on bed rest until I recover.”“I should probably stay with you. We don’t know how contagious this is.” He plants another kiss on her and then settles down for a rare lazy morning.6) Take My Heart (It Was Always Yours Anyway)Six years.Bellamy sighs, lingering at the door to her room. He raises his hand to push open the door and then hesitates.Six fucking years.In retrospect, he should’ve known she’d survive. Praimfaya has nothing on his Clarke.His Clarke.Slowly, Bellamy pushes open the door to her room, expecting her to be asleep – it’s late, everyone else went to bed long ago – but no, she’s awake, reading on her bed. He taps on the doorframe and she looks up, surprised.“Oh, hey.” She flips the book closed and gets to her feet, smiling slightly. He can’t do much else than just stare back at her. She’s so much older, so much more grown up. Different, but heartbreakingly familiar, too…Clarke’s brow furrows and she takes a few steps closer. “What’s wrong?”Bellamy almost laughs. She can still read him like a book, just like she always could. Not even Octavia knew him that well. “That,” he says gruffly, pushing his fingers into his hair. “That is what’s wrong.”Clarke frowns and shakes her head slightly, not understanding. It’s exactly what she used to do whenever she was confused, and that’s when Bellamy knows he just can’t handle it any longer.“It’s you,” he says before she can ask. “It’s everything about you. Fuck, I can’t do this…”“What are you talking about?”“It just—” He sighs and leans on the doorframe. “Six years is a hell of a separation.”Her face softens. “Yeah, I know. Trust me.”There’s a short pause. Bellamy opens his mouth, but nothing comes out. There are too many emotions and not enough words in the world to describe them.“You know, I thought about you every single day,” he blurts out.Clarke’s lips part and she steps even closer. “Bellamy…”“Every single day,” he insists. “Even thinking you were dead. I just – I couldn’t not think about you.”He holds her gaze, feeling something well up inside of him. “I still can’t.”Clarke doesn’t say anything for a long moment, just looks at him with wide blue eyes and an expression on her face that he can’t quite place. Bellamy tenses, thinking for a moment that he’s said something wrong. Stepped over an invisible boundary. “Shit, I’m sor—”Before he can finish his apology, Clarke surges forward and kisses him.He’s shocked at first, but he’s not a total idiot, so he cups her face almost immediately and kisses her back. It’s soft, gentle, but with no shortage of passion. They kiss with all the emotions they’ve been holding back for years, pouring everything into each other.Bellamy finally pulls back after what feels like years and presses his forehead into hers, keeping his eyes closed. A goofy smile works its way onto his face.“Took us long enough, huh?” Clarke asks, her fingers curling into his hair, and he can tell she’s smiling too.“Yeah.” He enters the bedroom, kicks the door closed behind him. “This is long overdue.”" True text

Of all the things Clarke’s been adding to her ever-growing to-do list, the one item she never expected would come up is a wedding. Every priority she’s ever had since her first step on the ground has been overtaken by survival. Surviving the harsher elements of Earth’s volatile weather. Surviving as a fledgling community of inexperienced, ill-equipped juvenile delinquents. Surviving war with the grounders. Surviving Mount Weather. Surviving the nuclear apocalypse — again. The very thought of survival has consumed her, commanding her utter and absolute attention right from the very first breath she’d drawn of organic, naturally produced air. Now, after almost a full year on the ground, she’s not sure she can quite remember how people even get married anymore. The mere concept alone seems almost foreign. Which is why when her mother breaks the news to her, her brain abruptly stutters to a grinding halt, and she finds herself at a complete loss for words for the first time in what feels like forever.

But at least she has his letters to look forward to and help her figure out what it is she actually wants.   Rating: Mature Chapter Summary:   Clarke made a decision not to tell him. But can she really hold in her feelings for Bellamy?   Author’s Note:   My apologies for the delay on this chapter. Again, real life rears its head. Much thanks to my beta Anne for the quick turnaround on this chapter.   For the second time in three days, Clarke awoke to the smell of something good coming from the kitchen.  She let herself linger in bed for a few minutes, when a glance at the clock told her she’d only been asleep for a couple of hours.  But she did feel better, as Bellamy had predicted and so she just rolled onto her side and inhaled their now-mingled scent on her pillow. She must have dozed off again because the next thing she felt was a gentle touch on her shoulder and as she turned her head, she found Bellamy smiling down at her. “Dinner’s ready, or almost ready.  I thought I’d give you five minutes warning.” “Thanks,” she replied, half sleepy and fully happy.  ""I’ll be right out.“ He seemed about to say something else, but stopped himself, instead nodding and giving her a fond smile before leaving her bedroom. A peek at the time told her that she’d only dozed for another half an hour, so she didn’t feel too lazy as she scrambled into her usual lounging clothes, a pair of soft, thin cotton pants that were a shade too heavy for sleepwear and her last remaining clean t-shirt. “I have to do laundry tomorrow,” she announced as she emerged from her bedroom, pushing her hair back from her face.  ""If you have anything left to clean, you can throw it in with my stuff.“ ""I was going to ask if you wanted me to take care of that when I did mine, but I thought you’d worry that I’d be handling your underwear,” Bellamy noted dryly as he stirred something in a pot on the stove. Clarke rolled her eyes.  ""Yeah, because you’ve never seen female underwear before.  I’d tell you to leave my bras alone, but otherwise, any time you want to do my laundry, be my guest.“  Noticing that he’d already set out some tableware on the counter, she took a seat on one of the stools.  ""Smells fantastic, whatever is in there.” “Don’t women have a thing about guys handling their underwear?” he asked, pulling the pot from the stove and beginning to dish out what appeared to be nothing more than spaghetti onto the plates.  Clarke couldn’t quite believe the enticing smell was coming from something as simple as a dish she could make herself. “Only if those guys are fondling them and sniffing them.  I don’t think that’s your game,” she answered, leaning forward as he pooled the noodles on her plate.  ""Okay, why does this smell so different from normal spaghetti?“ Continue reading here on AO3!

(AO3) IClarke pushed herself closer into Bellamy’s side as he walked them around the crowd. Their moms had given them permission to get ice cream from the stand a couple of yards from the park where they were spending the afternoon. Bellamy looked down at the toddler and reached to straighten the vanilla – and sprinkles, thank you very much – scone that was slowly slipping from her grip. He sent a small smirk to his friend before gripping her free hand. “Don’t worry, Princess. I got you.” Now that Bellamy was older, Abby and his mom gave him more liberties but also more responsibilities. He could go farther from them than he used to but he had to watch out for cars if he crossed the road and had to make sure neither Clarke nor his sister got away if they were going with him. Bellamy always felt like a superhero when he could walk around without his mom even if he knew she was still watching him most of the time. Even more so when he oversaw the girls’ safety. It was a challenge to adapt to their clashing personalities. While Octavia tended to run around, explore and talk to every stranger she saw (even if everyone told her not to), Clarke was shy and got scared more easily. Bellamy had heard Jake tell his mom that he would make a good teacher one day and he loved the sound of that. Bellamy was about to take a bite of his threat when someone bumped into him, sending most of the ice cream one the ground. The surprised of the impact made him removed his hand from Clarke’s. He quickly made a move to grab it back but only found air when he tried to. Panicking, Bellamy turned around to look for his friend. It took a few seconds but he located the mop of blonde hair a couple of feet away. She had her back to him and was obviously looking for him. He screamed her name and started running toward her. “You were gone.” Keep reading " False text

[READ ON AO3]   The actual reunion itself is sort of a blur. Everything just happens so fast. One minute, there’s nothing but endless, indistinguishable patches of green, green, and more green, accented with the unfamiliar sensation of humidity clinging to skin and uneven clods of earth beneath their boots. The next minute, there are voices, and gasps, and shouts, and laughter, and before anyone can blink through their dropped jaws and rapidly welling-up eyes, Bellamy’s arms are full of her. She’s different, Raven notes when Clarke finally pulls away and turns to hug Monty, tear tracks gleaming on her cheeks. It’s not just her hair, too, that one streak of berry pink glowing through the mass of blonde. It’s not just her physical frame, either, the generous curves more toned than ever before. It’s something about her that’s changed, something irrevocable and irreversible. Then again, they all are. [read the rest on ao3] " False text

If I don’t make the calls, who will?” Bellamy shakes his head and laughs. Clarke checks over her shoulder to be sure that nobody’s watching and leans across the candy cane striped barrier, dropping a kiss to his lips.  “Have I mentioned that this job is a lot more boring with Jaha as Santa instead of you?”  The bell adorning the tip of her hat jingles as Bellamy bats at it, stopping only when she slaps his hand away. He twirls a strand of her hair around his finger instead. “You know you didn’t have to come back again this year,” he says. Clarke shrugs. “Yeah, but the money’s nice. And it’s tradition, at this point.” Bellamy cocks a brow. “You don’t need the money. And does it really count as tradition without me?” “Probably not.” She tugs at his tie, smoothing the loosened knot against his shirt. The best part of post-grad Bellamy is definitely the fact that he still feels like he needs to wear a tie on teaching days. “I should still get back, though.”  “When do you get off?” Clarke smirks. “Depends on whether or not you help.” She’s pretty sure his glare is supposed to be stern, but his lips quirk at the ends. “When do you get off work?”  “Not for another two hours. But Santa has a break in 20 minutes.” Bellamy nods, gives another light tug to the green felt perched atop her head.  “I’m going to go get Octavia’s present, but I should be done by then.” One of the other elves starts loudly wondering if there are any candy canes left and Clarke takes a step back, grabbing a box from behind a tree. “I guess I can fit you in,” she calls just before she turns away.

It’s not an obstacle to be overcome. It’s not a new foe to be defeated.It’s just… news.“I—” she starts to say, and then stops. Her head suddenly feels compressed, like a hand is pushing down on the top of her head. She blinks, shaking her head in an attempt to jerk the invisible pressure off.“Oh,” she says at last. She pauses, floundering for something, anything to say. “Are you sure?”Abby looks slightly affronted by that, nostrils flaring in that way they used to whenever Clarke forgot to clean her room, or when Clarke got her first hickey and forgot to cover it up properly before going to breakfast the next morning.“Yes, I’m sure,” her mother says, her tone more tight than dry. “Marcus is a good man, Clarke.”Clarke snaps her mouth closed, shaking her head again. “No, Mom, that’s not—” She holds her hands out in front of her, patting placatingly at the air. “I know. You two are— I know.” She tilts her head, wincing slightly. “What I meant was, are you sure you want to do this right now?”Abby exhales slowly, her chin dipping in a nod. “I know it’s terrible timing. Really, it’s probably the last thing anyone wants to be bothered with right now. But with the way things are going…” She looks up, her eyes searching Clarke’s. “We just don’t want to miss this, and then find out later that it was the only chance we’d ever get. Do you understand that?”Images of dark curls and freckled skin flit through Clarke’s mind, disappearing as soon as they appear.She takes a deep breath, pulling up a small smile for her mother. “I understand. I’ll help.”In the end, there’s not really that much to do for the ceremony.Jackson enlists all the children’s help with gathering and weaving flowers together to drape across every drape-able surface. Raven rolls her eyes snippily when she hears the word “wedding”, but she loans out her souped-up speakers without hesitation. Food is tricky, considering they’re supposed to be rationing for Praimfaya, but the hunting team manages to scare up a fresh boar for the occasion. Before anyone can even ask them, Monty and Jasper are already dragging out large jerrycans of moonshine from whatever hole they’ve been hiding the stuff in.(At first, Clarke wants to say something to warn them against going overboard with the stuff — everyone still has to work tomorrow — but she watches them doing their ridiculous signature pseudo high-five, and, honestly, she just doesn’t have the heart.)“How’s this look?” Bellamy asks when Clarke walks over, a hand cupped over his eyes as he surveys the thin arch he’s just put up with Harper and Miller’s help. It’s a flimsy wooden thing, barely eight feet tall, held together by nothing more than a few well-placed nails, and plastered over with flowers to within an inch of its life.“A lot better than it should, considering it’s about to be taken apart again in a few hours’ time,” Clarke says, keeping her tone dry despite the warmth blooming in her chest at the sight. Funny how the mere sight of pretty things can make you forget about stuff like about the impending end of the world.Pushing past the thought, she glances up at Bellamy. “What about you? Are you ready?”Bellamy looks at her in surprise. “Uh, yeah? This is all that’s left, isn’t it?”“Oh.” She blinks, properly registering his genuine obliviousness. “Sorry, I— I thought Kane talked to you about this.”Bellamy shrugs, resting his hands on his hips. “About the wedding? Yeah, he asked if I’d help.” He gestures towards the flower arch. “I just did, didn’t I?”Clarke turns to face him properly, now slightly bemused. “Bellamy. You do know you’re the best man, right?”Bellamy whips his head round to stare at her, eyes rounded. “I— what?”She can’t ever remember smiling this hard. When’s the last time she’d full-on grinned like this? “He said he told you!”“He didn’t tell me that!” Bellamy insists, brows sharply furrowed and cheeks rapidly reddening. “He just said a whole bunch of stuff about— about how much we’ve been through together, and something about how he was proud of me or some shit, and—”Clarke squints up at him, still grinning. “Yeah, I think that was his version of telling you.”“Fuck.” Bellamy shakes his head, his freckles somehow even more prominent through his blush. “Why doesn’t he ever just come out and say shit?”She laughs softly, patting him on the arm. “Like father, like son. Kidding!” she adds quickly when Bellamy shoots her a despairing look, even as he leans slightly into her touch. “I’m kidding.”Frankly speaking, there’s really nothing for Bellamy to worry about. The entirety of his best man duties start and end with simply standing up at the arch by Kane’s side, with his hands clasped neatly and the rings safely in his pocket.They don’t even have to dress up or anything. No one does, considering the wedding is squeezed into the half hour between afternoon duties and dinner hour. (Clarke briefly considers sparing twenty minutes to go scavenge for a dress somewhere in one of the storage rooms, but she decides that the time would probably be better spent packing rations for their trip to ALIE’s lab the next day. Besides, no one’s going to care all that much about the way the maid of honour looks. She’s not the one getting married.)Kane keeps his jacket, but underneath that he’s got a cleaner, less threadbare shirt on. It’s a little closer to grey than white, but it’s more than enough for the occasion. Abby’s got a worn dress on, much more of a faded snowy blue than pristine white. Looking at it, Clarke can’t quite remember whom it’s even supposed to belong to. It’s too loose around the shoulders and the waist, but Clarke’s pretty sure Kane doesn’t even notice, his face soft as he smiles down at her mother.There are no chairs, so everyone has to just sort of stand around, but that’s not much of a problem considering Jaha keeps the ceremony short — a bonus which Clarke is deeply grateful for. In the span of just ten minutes, he’s pronouncing them husband and wife, Kane is leaning in to press his lips to Abby’s, and with a round of applause, it’s done. Her mother’s become a wife again.There’s literally nothing planned for the reception beyond a warm fire, some food and more moonshine than anyone really needs, so Clarke doesn’t expect it to last more than half an hour or so. Everyone’s tired out from a full day’s work, and tomorrow will be no different. They probably want to return to their quarters as soon as possible, to make the most of what little rest they can get.Even so, a solid hour after the sun’s gone down, she’s surprised to find a solid number of people still out in the yard, huddled in pockets around the fire, pouring themselves fourth and fifth refills of moonshine, dancing and laughing to the music playing from Raven’s speakers. It’s not by any obligation, either, considering Abby and Kane have long disappeared, retreating to their room hand in hand.No, it’s not that. People are staying because they genuinely want to; to spend time with their friends and family without having to worry about schedules and tasks and the invisible clock that’s constantly ticking over their heads.Even if it’s only for one night, everyone wants to just be.She smiles when she feels Bellamy come up beside her, his presence identifiable even without her turning to look.“Do I have to remind you to have fun at every party we have?” he says, turning to stand shoulder to shoulder with her as they survey the ongoing celebration.“We’ve only ever had two,” she points out mildly, turning to arch an eyebrow at him. “That doesn’t really count as every party.”“It does when I have to do it both times,” he returns easily, glancing over to where the music has shifted to something softer, more melodic. People are pairing off, friends and lovers alike wrapping their arms around each other as they sway to the lilting melody. There are even a few groups of three and even four, arms hooked around necks and waists as little clusters rock back and forth, the strains of giggling punctuated by tipsy hiccups.It’s nice, she thinks idly. It’s a certain sort of relaxed she hasn’t seen in far too long. Certainly not one she’s felt recently.“Shit, okay,” Bellamy mutters, pulling himself up like he’s preparing to lead a recon mission. “We should probably do this, right?”She sips on her moonshine, too absorbed with watching the others to really pay attention. “Do what?”Bellamy shrugs, plucking the cup out of her hand to set it aside. “Dance.”Clarke blinks at him, hand still hovering in midair.Truth be told, she’s still not quite sure if this day is actually happening. First a wedding, and now, Bellamy Blake’s just said the word ‘dance’ to her. 'Dance’.“I didn’t think you danced,” she says when she recovers from the momentary shock, one brow arching almost playfully.“I don’t,” he says dryly, even as he extends a hand to her, palm turned upwards.She rolls her eyes, but it’s a purely knee-jerk response. Lifting her hand, she slips it into his, hoping that he can’t feel the way her blood seems to be thrumming extra vigorously through her fingers.“This is not one of the things I thought we’d be doing before the end of the world,” she tells him as they walk over to the makeshift dancefloor. ('Dancefloor’ is a generous term, really. It’s more like a 'dance area’. Also, maybe they should have waited till they were in the dance area to hold hands. Now they’re just… walking while holding hands.)“Really?” Bellamy’s voice is light and teasing, but his fingers tighten ever so slightly over hers. “It was definitely on my checklist. Fill the food stores. Strip down unused machinery for raw materials. Dance at Kane and your mom’s wedding.”“Jesus,” Clarke mutters, a sudden thought occurring to her. “Does that— oh God, he’s my stepdad now, isn’t he? That’s gonna get awkward.”Bellamy glances at her out of the corner of his eye. “Why? Not like you guys don’t already get along.”“For you, I mean,” Clarke says, giving his hand a light squeeze as they enter the dance area. “You know how kids sometimes feel neglected when their parents remarry—”“Fuck you,” Bellamy says amiably, turning to face her. His grip shifts accordingly, bringing both their hands up by their sides. “I’m trying to dance here.”She sniggers softly, but she brings her free hand up to rest on his arm, just below his shoulder. “'Trying’ being the operative word.”Instead of slinging another easy comeback, he clears his throat and glances down. Carefully, he puts his hand on her waist. It’s perfectly proper, his palm curving along the bottom of her ribcage.Even so, there’s something so goddamn delicate about the simple action that it makes her want to blush like a fucking teenager.(God. She is a teenager. It’s getting easier and easier to forget that.)By the time she blinks herself out of her thoughts, they’re moving. Swaying, one foot to another, revolving in a slow circle.“Wow,” she says, glancing down at their feet. “You actually can dance.”His hand is really warm on her waist — really warm, even through the combined barriers of her shirt and jacket. “Blame Octavia,” he mutters, a wry smile tugging at his lips. “She used to stand on my feet for hours whenever our mom would let her put a record on. Drove me crazy.”Clarke looks up at him, at the soft creases between his brows as he relays the memory, and fuck, she can practically feel her heart melting to mush. Not just a light softening, either — no, it’s melting down to actual warm, thick, slightly fluffy, easily stirrable mush. Jesus Christ. She’s faced down grounder warriors and war-chiefs twice her size, and she can’t keep it together over a stupid fucking story of her co-leader being a good brother.She waits for more, but Bellamy’s lips press together, forming a thin line as a familiar tic jumps in his jaw.She takes a half-step closer on impulse, her hand rubbing comfortingly over his arm. “She’ll come back, Bellamy. She won’t stay away forever.”The breath he draws is deep enough that she can feel the swell of it, his shoulder rising and falling under her palm. For a moment, he looks as if he’s about to say something — but then he gives a slight shake of his head, his hand shifting on her waist to adjust to their increased proximity, his fingers edging over the bottom hem of her jacket.“Not doing too bad yourself,” he says, his tone light as he casts a pointed look at their moving feet. “Rhythm’s not terrible. Not great… but not terrible.”She rolls her eyes, gently prodding him in the dip where his arm and torso meet before replacing her hand on his shoulder, a little lower down than before. “Thanks for the compliment, Gene Kelly.” She catches herself half a second later, dragging her gaze up to his. “That's— uh, it’s from this old movie back on the Ark.”To her surprise, he nods easily. “Singin’ in the Rain.”Her brows shoot up. “You know it?”He seems to consider the question. “I know of it. Only ever saw bits and pieces of it a few times.” He shrugs at her confused frown. “Movie nights in the mess hall.”Clarke’s cheeks heat up, suddenly recalling how only Alpha Station quarters were afforded their own individual projector systems. “Oh. Right.”If Bellamy’s noticed her momentary fumble, he does a good job of ignoring it. Instead, he tips his head back, squinting up at the starry night sky. “Doubt anyone would want to sing and dance if it rains now.”Her throat clenches, fingers tightening their hold on his hand reflexively. “Cheerful reminder.”To her surprise, his mouth curves in a small smile, his head tipping back down to face her properly. “The black rain’s gonna be here any day now, Clarke. We might as well talk about it.”“Or make bad jokes about it,” she mutters, inching even closer as if she can somehow shelter herself just by virtue of being practically cradled against his chest.He huffs a small laugh, his right palm starting to rub steady half-circles into her back. “We’ve done everything we can, taken all the precautions. We’ll be fine, Clarke. Worry about getting yourself to ALIE’s lab safely.”She shudders, savouring the comfort of his hand on her spine, warm and soothing. I wish I didn’t have to leave, she thinks of saying.“Do you think they’re wasting their time?” is what she says instead.She looks up when she feels his shoulder stiffen under her palm, meeting his uncomprehending frown. “Kane,” she clarifies, suddenly aware of how close they are. Even with just the dim firelight behind them, she can almost see where the warm brown of his irises meets the jet black of his pupils. “And my mom,” she manages to finish, her throat suddenly much drier than before. “I mean, this whole wedding thing.”Fuck. What is she even trying to say?She swallows, blinking hard. “I know people think it’s stupid.”Bellamy looks down at her, his face serious. “We only have so much time left. I don’t think it’s stupid to want to make the most of it.”She can feel her heart, actually feel it thudding in her chest as their gazes lock. She’s always had the sensation of being able to see right into Bellamy, past his guards and his walls, into the very core of his being. Of being able to see the man hidden away behind the armour of bravado. A man who, it always seemed to her, to be made entirely of love, every fibre of him pulsing and beating with the sheer force of it.But this is different. This… somehow, this feels like everything’s been switched around between the two of them. She has the oddest feeling that in this moment, he’s the one seeing into her.A loud chorus of whoops explodes from the small crowd gathered around the fire, cleaving into the silence between them with a violent jolt. Abruptly coming back to her senses, she forces her body into motion, blinking rapidly as she takes a deliberate step back.Bellamy, attuned as always, instantly lets his right hand drop from her waist, his left releasing her hand with a smooth haste that speaks more of habitual instinct than a genuine desire to break contact.She tries not to miss the warmth of his touch. 'Tries’ being the operative word, she tells herself dejectedly.Clearing her throat, she looks up at him.“Thank you,” she says.When he looks at her, his expression is unreadable.No, it’s not, she realises dully. There’s a difference between something being unreadable and her not allowing herself to read it.“For the dance,” she adds. Suddenly, she feels the need to clarify what she means.She squares her shoulders, ignoring the small whisper in the back of her head telling her that Bellamy’s not the one who’s unsure what she means.There’s a brief pause, a moment of silence where she thinks Bellamy might say something.And then he nods, the corner of his mouth quirking upwards in the imitation of an easy smile.“Anytime,” he says. His voice is surprisingly tender. Full of soft understanding, affection, and something that sounds a lot like—“Need any help?” she blurts out. She makes a belated gesture towards the flower arch still sitting in the middle of camp. “Taking it down, I mean.”He turns to look at it, squinting across camp. There are a bunch of kids lounging around it, some picking off petals and letting them drift to the ground, some sitting under it with their heads on each other’s shoulders and their feet in each other’s laps, everyone wearing the same smile of peaceful contentment.“Nah,” he says, tilting his head as he surveys the scene. “Think I’m gonna give it a little more time.”Just then, it dawns on her with startling clarity. Shell-shocked, she stares at his profile, the warm firelight washing across that face she’s grown to know even better than her own, the red-orange rays flickering in and out of the tangled mess of dark curls atop his head.A wet heat pricks at her eyes, but she pushes it back down. There’s time, she tells herself fiercely. If there’s just one thing that’s been keeping her on her feet these days, just one thing beckoning her to rise from her bed every morning, calling her to keep pushing forward, step by agonising step, it’s this. There’s time.Not much, to be certain — but whatever’s left of it belongs to them.“Yeah,” she says. “Yeah, okay.”" True text

The food isn’t great and she’s really sick of mosquitoes, but she’s only six days into the summer and she’s happier than she has been in months. “You’re doing great, Madi,” Clarke says as she watches the girl paint a flower onto a ceramic bowl. “Bellamy, you could be doing a little better.” “That doesn’t seem like a great teaching technique,” Bellamy snarls and when he looks up from his mug, there’s paint on his nose and on a curl plastered to his temple. Clarke bites back her smile and nods, turning her attention to the boy sitting next to her. “It’s totally up to you, Aden, but I’d add a little more color to that plate,” she says, pushing her tray of paints a little closer to him. “Really make it pop.” “Thanks,” he says quietly, dipping a clean brush into the red paint. Clarke watches him add the color before looking around the table at the other campers’ creations. Her class is currently filled with her and Bellamy’s 11-13-year-olds and, since he doesn’t have a lesson scheduled, he thought he’d sit in for the hour. It’s the most time they’ve spent together since that night in the bar when they kissed until Clarke couldn’t feel her lips anymore. It’s been four days and things have been crazy with camp and courses and all the kids. And every time they find themselves alone, Lincoln needs help moving something heavy or Monty needs help getting one of his campers to stop crying from being homesick. One time, Octavia walked into the clubhouse just as Bellamy had tilted Clarke’s face toward his and he had to lie and tell her that he found a tick on Clarke’s eyebrow. And, surprisingly, Clarke doesn’t mind any of it. She likes the attention from Bellamy and she definitely liked kissing him. She likes spending time with the campers and getting to see them having so much fun. She likes getting to know the other counselors when they’re on duty or watching a stupid movie in the clubhouse. The food isn’t great and she’s really sick of mosquitos, but she’s only six days into the summer and she’s happier than she has been in months. Camp isn’t fixing any of her problems—her dad is still dead, Wells is still in love with her and she’s still not in love with him, her mother is still acting like a robot, and she only barely knows what she’s doing as a camp counselor—but it’s fun. Clarke can’t remember the last time she had fun. It might have been the last date she went on with Lexa before her dad died. It might have been last summer when she and Wells took a quick, impromptu roadtrip from Boston to Maine for a long weekend. She’s having fun now, though. She keeps finding herself smiling at the kids or the other counselors and meaning it. She spends her days jumping into the lake or painting in class or losing terribly at tennis against Monty—which always makes the campers laugh—and it’s unlike anything she’s ever done before.

Also, here’s an AU based on that adorable gifset of Chris Evans and his best friend on the red carpet. Set to the tune of Bellarke. :) —— [AO3] caught in a riptide This is probably the largest gathering of people she has ever seen, including her high school piano recital and her college graduation where she was sporting a rather killer hangover for drinking the night before because of one man who said it would just be a celebratory beer – oh, speaking of said man, said man is now walking up to her with a big goofy grin on his rather handsome face, and with a bottle of water in his hand. He looks so good in a tuxedo and with his hair disheveled like that, she gets the feeling she’ll be leaving the gala without a best friend in tow tonight. “Got your water bottle, princess,” he jeers, hip checking her as she slinks her arm around his and takes the bottle from him.  She laughs and takes a hearty sip, giving him a look that says ‘this is proof that you’re a sucker for me’. On how she gets that across by just one look is borne from the nearly two decades that they have been best friends. And the look that he sends her back, one that clearly says ‘I just took pity on you’, is also borne of the same reason. They laugh at this ridiculously weird connection together before they are interrupted by the flashing of lights. She was momentarily blinded, but when she looks up at him, she couldn’t help but notice the hardness that has taken place behind the cordiality in his eyes. He spares her a brief smile before focusing back to the cameras – her, not missing the way his arm tightens around hers.  Read More " False text
