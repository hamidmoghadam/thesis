Microsyntax is a term I dreamed up years ago for the conventions on social media like Twitter like hashtags, retweets, and the like.My ‘career’ as a whatever-it-is-I-am (’public intellectual’ has a nicer ring than ‘obsessive scribbler’) keeps me in constant contact with social media tools, and I want to speak in favor of some suggested patterns that I am using, that others might adopt.Vertical bar (’|’) to indicate authorship or attributionI have shifted to a single character mechanism to replace attribution and authorship. So for example, when I attribute a blockquote in a post as a quote by a given author, I make it look like this:Bigger Cities Make Do With Less | Luis Bettencourt, Geoffrey WestThis new, more quantitative science of cities is becoming possible because of the increasing availability of information — official statistics as well as novel measures of human and social activity — on cities and metropolitan areas worldwide.I use the same convention in Twitter, where the reduction in characters is an additional benefit. And this can be an international standard, independent of language.Dropping the conjunction in comma separated listsAs you may be aware, there has been ongoing contention about the placement of a final comma in lists prior to the coordinating conjunction (usually ’or’, or ‘and’), called the serial comma (see Serial comma in Wikipedia). I think like a programmer or logician, so my solution most recently has been to avoid the arguments about whether or use the serial comma or not, and instead, drop the conjunction.So, instead of worrying about the ambiguity in phrases like this:To my parents, Mother Teresa and the Pope:and resolving it with a serial commaTo my parents, Mother Teresa, and the Pope:I instead use just the serial comma:To my parents, Mother Teresa, the Pope:In this case the series has an implied logical ‘and’ connecting the elements of the series. After all the commas are a shorthand for the longer but syntactically correctTo my parents and Mother Teresa and the Popewhich is unambiguous. The commas are like diacritical marks that represent ‘and’s.In the case of a series ending in an or, I suggest separating with semicolons. Consider the case of the Maine Labor Dispute in 2017 (again, see Serial comma in Wikipedia), where the meaning of a rule about overtime pay hinged on a series ending in ‘or’ but lacking a serial comma –The canning, processing, preserving, freezing, drying, marketing, storing, packing for shipment or distribution– of certain goods were ineligible for overtime pay. The question was whether the list referred to distribution of the goods, or only packing of the goods for distribution.The uses of semicolons as marks representing ‘or’s would be unequivocal:The canning; processing; preserving; freezing; drying; marketing; storing; packing for shipment; distributionversusThe distribution or canning; processing; preserving; freezing; drying; marketing; storing; packing for shipmentorThe canning; processing; preserving; freezing; drying; marketing; storing; packing for shipment or distributionThe last two are synonymous: distribution is one thing in contract to the ‘or’ list starting with ‘canning’ and ending with ‘packing for shipment’.This use of semicolons to indicate a pause between clauses is quite similar in purpose, so it shouldn’t confuse greatly. The greatest difficulty will be to get people to elide the final ‘and’ or ‘or’ in lists conceptually. Turning numbers aroundMy last recommendation is quite simple: we should adopt (or revert to) a different natural number system where the units would precede the ‘decade’ or ‘tens’, and so on. This form is in use in many languages, like German and Czech. But we should reverse the order of the numbers in left-to-right languages so that we can simply read the number from left to right.So, an example: 1,234,567This is read as one million two hundred and thirty four thousand, five hundred and sixty seven. But think about the processing. I have to process the number completely from right to left before I can say the first ‘one million’, because I don’t know the magnitude by just looking at the ‘1,’ at the beginning.(Note, we have the vestiges of this in English for the numbers thirteen through nineteen which are unit + ten in form, and the twenty through ninety decade numbers, which are short hand for ‘two ten’ and so on.)So consider this case:123,456,789Which we read today as ‘one hundred twenty three million, four hundred and fifty six thousand, seven hundred eighty nine’. It’s a numeral with millions, thousands, and hundreds groups divided by commas. If we reverse, we’d get this:987,654,321and we adopted the ‘four and twenty blackbirds’ scheme for reading the number, I would read it as ‘nine and eighty and seven hundred, six and fifty and four hundred thousand, three and twenty and one hundred million’. I am not betting on that coming into use anytime soon."

They haven’t shared the actual number, which means it’s so large it will stick in the throat.It smells suspiciously like Yahoo’s move after Marissa Mayer became CEO (see What Marissa Mayer’s ‘no remote work’ dictate means, and Yahoo’s Mayer thinks that remote workers are… too remote), and decreed that a cultural transformation had to happen, and right now, at the failing internet was-once-a-giant. Note that it didn’t succeed at Yahoo, except in a bottomline way.The stark reality of IBM’s situation – 20 consecutive quarters of falling revenue – does raise the question of the judgment of those making this decision. How do they know that this massive shake up will lead to the end they desire? IBM, a Pioneer of Remote Work, Calls Workers Back to the Office | John SimonsBig Blue’s leaders want employees to work differently now, said Laurie Friedman, a company spokeswoman. The company has rebuilt design and digital marketing teams to quickly respond to real-time data and customer feedback, collaborations that happen more easily when teams work shoulder to shoulder, Ms. Friedman said, adding that the “vast majority” of IBM’s telecommuters have chosen to join their teams in person.More likely the underlying principle is that making people come to the office means they can be watched and managed more directly, but that isn’t strongly correlated with better results or increased output. The reality is that the arguments about remote work aren’t about geography: it’s about bureaucracy.So, where’s the proof?But they don’t need proof. Rometty and Co. need to point at actions being taken to turn the company’s decline around, so this is likely a smokescreen, and a way to get rid of a bunch of high-priced workers without calling it a layoff.The strangest thing is to position old-fashioned 9-to-5 in the office as some advance over what IBM’s been doing. Remember that IBM makes social tools – like Sametime, Verse, and Connections – whose value proposition is that people can work together effectively no matter where they are. So what are they going to tell their customers now?

It is being joined by working-class Labour voters, especially in the north of Britain, who favored a British exit and do not consider Mr. Corbyn a plausible prime minister, even if they like some of his traditional left-wing redistributive policies.[…]While Mr. Cameron seemed to appeal to “the aspiring classes,” Mrs. May has pitched her appeal to citizens who are worried about an uncertain future, who are known widely as “Jams” — those who can “just about manage” to get by.To broaden the perspective beyond the UK, I return again to the City Journal piece on the social criticism of Christophe Guilluy by Christopher Caldwell (see my earlier comments in Christoper Caldwell, The French, Coming Apart). Guilluy makes the distinction between the politics of the metropolitan French, who are a combination of the economically successful bourgeoisie of the major cities and urban immigrants. The working class non-immigrant French have been increasingly pushed from the metropolitan cities, out into la France périphérique. They have become what I call the Left Behinds, like the Americans living in flyover country, here, that rejected the metropolitan ideals of Clinton, and took a chance with Trump, who at least acknowledged their existence and grievances.Here’s Caldwell from The French, Coming Apart:Since the age of social democracy, we have assumed that contentious political issues inevitably pit “the rich” against “the poor” and that the fortunes of one group must be wrested from the other. But the metropolitan bourgeoisie no longer lives cheek-by-jowl with native French people of lesser means and different values. In Paris and other cities of Guilluy’s fortunate France, one often encounters an appearance of civility, even consensus, where once there was class conflict. But this is an illusion: one side has been driven from the field.The old bourgeoisie hasn’t been supplanted; it has been supplemented by a second bourgeoisie that occupies the previously non-bourgeois housing stock. For every old-economy banker in an inherited high-ceilinged Second Empire apartment off the Champs-Élysées, there is a new-economy television anchor or high-tech patent attorney living in some exorbitantly remodeled mews house in the Marais. A New Yorker might see these two bourgeoisies as analogous to residents of the Upper East and Upper West Sides. They have arrived through different routes, and they might once have held different political opinions, but they don’t now. Guilluy notes that the conservative presidential candidate Alain Juppé, mayor of Bordeaux, and Gérard Collomb, the Socialist running Lyon, pursue identical policies. As Paris has become not just the richest city in France but the richest city in the history of France, its residents have come to describe their politics as “on the left”—a judgment that tomorrow’s historians might dispute. Most often, Parisians mean what Guilluy calls la gauche hashtag, or what we might call the “glass-ceiling Left,” preoccupied with redistribution among, not from, elites: we may have done nothing for the poor, but we did appoint the first disabled lesbian parking commissioner.Upwardly mobile urbanites, observes Guilluy, call Paris “the land of possibilities,” the “ideapolis.” One is reminded of Richard Florida and other extollers of the “Creative Class.” The good fortune of Creative Class members appears (to them) to have nothing to do with any kind of capitalist struggle. Never have conditions been more favorable for deluding a class of fortunate people into thinking that they owe their privilege to being nicer, or smarter, or more honest, than everyone else. Why would they think otherwise? They never meet anyone who disagrees with them. The immigrants with whom the creatives share the city are dazzlingly different, exotic, even frightening, but on the central question of our time—whether the global economic system is working or failing—they see eye to eye. “Our Immigrants, Our Strength,” was the title of a New York Times op-ed signed by London mayor Sadiq Khan, New York mayor Bill de Blasio, and Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo after September’s terrorist bomb blasts in New York. This estrangement is why electoral results around the world last year—from Brexit to the election of Donald Trump—proved so difficult to anticipate. Those outside the city gates in la France périphérique are invisible, their wishes incomprehensible. It’s as if they don’t exist. But they do.[…]The two traditional French parties—the Republicans, who once followed a conservative program elaborated by Charles de Gaulle; and the Socialists, who once followed socialism—still compete for votes, but along an ever-narrowing spectrum of issues. The real divide is no longer between the “Right” and the “Left” but between the metropoles and the peripheries. The traditional parties thrive in the former. The National Front (FN) is the party of the outside.In an era when conservative and socialist metropolitans have identical platforms, the hypocrisy latent in the left-versus-right dimension becomes clear. Obama’s policies, if you look closely, were really more like a moderate Republican than a socialist. Obamacare was originally Romneycare, remember, the product of a moderate republican governor of one of the most ‘liberal’ (or, in the new orientation, one of the most ‘metropolitan’) of US states, Massachusetts. So, Theresa May is getting the jump on this wholesale political realignment, and pledging her loyalty to the Jams, the left behinds, the peripheral, a class that wants a more closed society with less immigration, less ‘free trade’, less metropolitanism. Macron notably stands to the side of the old political axis, neither conservative or socialist, but both: he’s openly a metropolitan, neoliberal globalist, in favor of French involvement in the EU and hypercapitalist global trade. Le Pen is a deeply flawed politician, who is likely to be dogged by the National Front’s history indefinitely. But that doesn’t mean that her current positioning – as the champion of the left behinds, the advocate for a more closed society and reorganized economic order – isn’t sensible and attractive to her supporters. It is. But that slot could be filled by a more traditional conservative moving to the new dynamic, like Theresa May has done in the UK. It just won’t be Juppé. Cameron, her predecessor, was blindsided by the future, too, just like Clinton’s democrats, UK’s Labour, and France’s Socialists and Conservatives.Will the Democrats swing into the realignment or fight it? Does Clinton’s fumble mean that they will point their north star away from metropolitanism, away from neoliberal free trade, globalism, and the supposed benefits of an ‘open’ society? Will they fight to become the people’s party, embrace populism, and reject the left-versus-right alignment of conventional politics, instead of remaining the party of the bourgeoisie and their metropolitan allies: minorities and the urban poor? Can they return to their roots of supporting working people and unions, for example, and grassroots opposition to big business and the power of big money? Can they embrace populism and reject globalism?We’ll just have to see. But so far, not so much." True text

My mother used to have a saying that if you don’t have something nice to say, say nothing at all. So, instead, let’s abstract the conversation just briefly to some of the general concepts and talk about those, because it’s really interesting.Just an absurd and asinine thing to say. He has nothing nice to say about the other devices? Nothing?! Even if the current crop of devices aren’t perfect — and I don’t think anyone would argue that they are — it’s foolish not to acknowledge their place in the market right now. Sure, Apple isn’t playing directly in the space (yet), but even compared to Siri, these things are far more compelling.Moving on:So there’s many moments where a voice assistant is really beneficial, but that doesn’t mean you’d never want a screen. So the idea of not having a screen, I don’t think suits many situations. For example if I’m looking for directions and I’m using Maps, Siri can tell me those directions by voice and that’s really convenient but it’s even better if I can see that map, and I can see what turns are coming up, and I can see where there is congestion, I understand better my route, and what I’m going to do.Okay, so this is exactly what Amazon just released today. Ahead of whatever Apple is planning to release. The consensus has long been that Apple doesn’t care about doing something first, they care about doing something right. Per Schiller’s comments above, the Echo Show is clearly what Apple views to be the right approach. So will Apple be able to make a better version of it?Unknowable right now, of course. But given the state of Siri versus the other assistants, I’m skeptical. Yes, I’m skeptical of Apple.

[via  Defining  Social Business Design: Style vs. Substance by Peter Kim] For the most part, people understand that we’re talking about what’s  on the horizon for business. However, most detractors seem to take issue  with the style of the idea’s communication rather than its substance.  Some say they don’t understand. I’ll take that at face value and suggest  they try harder. Others ask why simpler words weren’t used. Well, as a  certain bald-headed guru told me, “words matter.”  Some new terms take a lot of persuading before they become lodged in  the zeitgeist, like Web 2.0 and social tools, in the past ten years.  But, now, on balance, we can see that these ideas have helped to  characterize what is going on: to clarify, not to confuse. Many people are naturally reluctant to adopt what might just be  specious terms, especially after being subjected to 'knowledge  management’ projects, or asked to 'think out of the box’ at company  offsites, or being barraged with market speak by a word-happy  advertising culture. But I believe that words, and even more importantly, metaphors,  matter. How we choose to name things makes a difference. Unlike Peter Kim and his associates at Dachis, I might have been more  metaphorical and less riveted down in my prose for a social business  description than Peter was in his post today, and in the earlier group  post (see Social  Business Design). Of course, they are advancing a more complex  picture – social business design, and its moving parts – while I am  simply sketching out the anthropology of the thing. Since I am doing a ten minute sprint presentation on social business  at tomorrow’s 140 Character conference, here’s my handwave. Social Business 'Social Business’ denotes businesses organized around social ties and  the use of social technologies to support them. This is intended to represent a break between companies (in general)  organized prior to the rise of the social web. Leaving aside any implied methods for designing, building, or even  managing such organizations, I offer a few one-liners to try to capture  the essential elements of these organizations.

stoweboyd 160260927157 "2017-05-03 10:58:49 GMT" http://stoweboyd.com/post/160260927157/douthat-mounk-and-the-fate-of-france "Yascha Mounk is perhaps one of the most eloquent defenders of ‘liberal democracy’, and he’s concerned with the rise of populist ‘right wing’ parties and leaders, like Trump, Le Pen, and Orbán. However, where he and many others seem to stub their toe is the right versus left dimension, which he and others are blinded by.In his attempted takedown of Ross Douthat, who has opened a can of worms by trying to drive a reassessment of Le Pen as a populist nationalist, Mounk fails to really make a dent, and instead, simply marshals the ‘metropolitan’ talking points that others (like Sylvie Kauffman) have made recently. Mounk starts by praising Douthat for being able to pose alternative ways of looking at what’s going on, but in his efforts to see Le Pen as part of tectonic realignment at the foundation of political order, Younk says Douthat has gone too far:Yascha Mounk, No, There Is No Case For Le PenThat changed [his regard for Douthat] when Douthat penned his latest column, in which he puts his considerable skills in the service of defending the indefensible: the election of a post-fascist who presents a clear and present danger to ethnic and religious minorities in France.Younk is focused on the threat to the established order that Le Pen represents, and his arguments are principally with her parties continued alignment with a fascist and xenophobic history in her party, and, it must be said, in France as a nation. France is the nation of Vichy, too, and not just De Gaulle. He argues that her policies on issues of the public square – like women wearing headscarves in public – are slightly more draconian that those of Sarkozy. But this election is not about headscarves, or even anti-islamism: it’s about globalism.Mounk’s counter to Douthat never really touches on the deep changes going on, the realignment of politics away from right versus left toward the new up/down split, between the ‘open society’ stance of globalist urban elite (Macron in France, Clinton in the US), and the ‘closed society’ of nationalist working class in flyover country (Le Pen and Mélenchon n France, Trump in the US, May in the UK).When you unthread the xenophobia and cryptofascism from the closed society arguments, what is left is a coherent political response to the deep problems of our time, a rejection of the globalist hypercapitalism that has led to huge inequality of income and opportunity across the industrialized world, and across Europe. It is a rejection of the transfer of political and economic control to technocratic EU functionaries in Brussels, and immigration policies that favor immigrants over natives.In Douthat’s Op-Ed piece today, when responding to Mounk and others who have attacked him for acknowledging Le Pen’s position in this realignment, he mentions Christopher Caldwell’s recent article on Christophe Guilluy as the best characterization of what is actually going on in France, and I agree. I wrote about this last week (see Christoper Caldwell, The French, Coming Apart). Guilluy says that the workings of globalization have left no room for the marginalized working class of France, and the traditional rivalry/collusion of the two wings of the neoliberal globalist ‘party’ – center right versus center left – has failed to include the interests of those on the periphery, out in the hinterlands away from the knowledge workers in the major metropolitian areas. So the Socialists and Republicans are out of the running, rejected by what looks like ‘extremists’ when viewed in the old left-versus-right perspective. But the realignment has already happened, and is blindsiding those stuck in the right-versus-left mindset, like Mounk, and he attacks Douthat (not one of my favorite people) for ‘defending the indefensible’. However, Douthat is attempting to shift to the new paradigm, discussing open versus closed societies, suggesting that the anti-globalist, anti-elite, marginalized Left Behinds have a case. And they have to pick someone to make that case. They have to follow someone, after all.Denying the legitimacy of the Left Behind’s grievances led to a Trump victory in the US and Brexit in the UK, and it could lead to an upset of the established order in France, if not in this election, then in the next.Meanwhile, the other extremist, Mélenchon can’t bring himself to support Macron, because to do so is to deny the primacy of the antiglobalist agenda, and to place the aspirations of the elite above the needs of the Left Behinds. Unlike Sanders’ support for Clinton, in the US, which pissed off many of his most ardent followers.So, where will the center of gravity fall in France?" True text

One of the most critical aspects of the changes I have argued for is the rejection of business practices founded on folklore, and the adoption of new ways of work grounded on science, and in particular, cognitive science. Ignoring what we have learned in recent years about human reasoning and continuing to rely on outdated and non-scientific myths would not only be wrong, but dangerous.In our time, we are learning that how we reason is not purely rational. We are not really anything like logical engines. In fact, we are honeycombed with cognitive biases so prevalent and far-reaching it’s astonishing we’ve been able to accomplish as much as we have, as a species.What has been revealed about human cognition in recent decades is the psychological equivalent of discovering that the Sun is at the center of the solar system, not the Earth.Prior to Copernicus, the naturalistic observation of the Sun’s rising in the east and setting in the west led to the conviction that the Sun circled the Earth, as did the other ‘heavenly bodies’. And, those who argued otherwise were considered irreligious. Galileo spent his life under house arrest, and indeed, Giordano Bruno, who extended the Copernican theory by stating the stars were distant suns that might have their own planets with distant life on them, was burned at the stake in 1600.In our time, we are learning that how we reason is not purely rational. We are not really anything like logical engines. In fact, we are honeycombed with cognitive biases so prevalent and far-reaching it’s astonishing we’ve been able to accomplish as much as we have, as a species.When we reflect on our reasoning, we believe, deeply, that when we make a decision we weigh various factors, considering alternatives and projecting their outcomes, and then we judiciously come to a decision. We can explain our reasoning to others, so that they can support or refute our reasoning. It all works just like the Sun rising in the east and setting in the west.Except it is untrue. The model in our heads is not at all like what actually goes on in our heads.As I explored in a recent report created in cooperation with Erik Larson, the CEO of Cloverpop, this is the big lie underlying business:There is an enormous lie underlying business, the lie that decisions are made rationally, applying logic and expertise, sifting evidence, and carefully weighing alternatives. However, the science is clear: in general, we don’t really make decisions that way: we fake it, instead.In the report, I lay out an abbreviated exploration of the work of cognitive scientists who have revealed the ways our minds actually fake decision making. Not only do we fake our way through decisions, we aren’t even aware we are faking it. Our mind covers up behind itself, like the drunk who blacked out, and doesn’t remember walking home, but obviously he did because here he is, in the bathtub with his shoes on.What has been revealed about human cognition in recent decades is the psychological equivalent of discovering that the Sun is at the center of the solar system, not the Earth.At the heart of the report is a conversation with Erik, who has investigated the nature of human decision making with the goal of helping business leaders make better decisions, which requires, first of all, admitting the big lie, and then adopting a way to untell that lie.I asked Erik if we have reached a turning point, when business leaders are willing to stop pretending the Sun circles the Earth, and accept that decision making — in a post-Kahneman world — needs to be approached differently. He said,We’ve learned these cognitive biases are everywhere. Generations of researchers have uncovered dozens of biases, and ways that these biases hurt us. The snowball has been rolling and growing for 40 years: it’s not like the research started yesterday. But the financial crisis caused us to pay attention to our cognitive limitations, brought it out to center stage.I think that the next stage is answering the question ‘what are we going to do about it?’Erik wrote an HBR article, A Checklist for Making Faster, Better Decisions, which offered a practical application of behavioral economics to everyday decision-making, and suggested that systematically following a specific process can counter a great deal of these problems. That’s a place where software can make a big difference, and applying software to the slippery problems embedded in decision making is exactly what we should be doing about it.I recommend that you read the entire report, and reflect on the message at the core, based on the findings from Cloverpop’s research: Business managers and executives underperform by 20% because of poor decision making.Perhaps quantifying it will make it clear how large an opportunity exists — or how expensive the shortfall in making bad decisions is — and that will motivate you to adopt Cloverpop’s technique to help claw back that 20% of underperformance, especially important in a time when companies have less margin for error than ever.Originally posted on Work Futures."

We need to find common cause and grow local, regional, national, and international mutual associations, owned by the members and dedicated to decreasing the staggering risks that confront us, individually and in common. These organizations can be as diverse as unions dedicated to protecting the interests of freelancers (like the Freelancer’s Union), local food cooperatives, or international policy organizations.Mutualist Manifesto:We need to commit ourselves – individually and collectively – to finding common cause and the general recourse to a mutualist response to problems that confront us at every scale: in our neighborhoods, cities, regions, nations and globally.

But so does every other herder, and if nothing halts their collective self-centered actions, the pasture will quickly be reduced to a desert.One pessimistic interpretation is that absent the intervention of an outside power – a Leviathan like a king or a democratic government, or religious decrees – the unchecked exploitation of the commons is inevitable.Ostrom,  however, found numerous examples of well-managed CPRs across the world, based on her field work in the management of pasture by locals in Africa and irrigation systems management in villages of western Nepal, and the examination of other systems of commons management.As noted in a piece in the Economist, Ostrom cataloged the rules that are necessary for managing a commons:In “Governing the Commons”, which was published in 1990, Elinor Ostrom of Indiana University described the rules needed to keep a commons going. She showed that there are almost always elaborate conventions over who can use resources and when. What you take out of a commons has to be proportional to what you put in. Usage has to be compatible with the commons’ underlying health (ie, you cannot just keep grazing your animals regardless). Everyone has to have some say in the rules. And people usually pay more attention to monitoring abuses and to conflict resolution than to sanctions and punishment.In her Governing the Commons (1990) she laid out the 8 Principles for Managing a Commons:1. Define clear group boundaries2. Match rules governing use of common goods to local needs and conditions.3. Ensure that those affected by the rules can participate in modifying the rules.4. Make sure the rule-making rights of community members are respected by outside authorities.5. Develop a system, carried out by community members, for monitoring members’ behavior.6. Use graduated sanctions for rule violators.7. Provide accessible, low-cost means for dispute resolution.8. Build responsibility for governing the common resource in nested tiers from the lowest level up [better translated into network terms, ‘from the smallest social scale’] to the entire interconnected system [‘network’].What if we were to consider the Earth as a commons, and at the local level, each watershed and island, each prairie and region, as commons, as well?The premise that the greatest degree of control for a shared resource – for example the Hudson Valley watershed – should be determined principally by those living within that watershed. Note, however, that resource must be managed by the principles above, along with the zeroth principle: all activities must be based on the foundation of causing the least harm to the commons as possible, so that the commons can continue to be used by its members and by future generations.This zeroth rule is also equivalent to environmentalist Aldo Leopold’s golden rule:A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.Or paraphrased, We can judge the morality of political and social actions by the degree to which they harm or help the land, the sea, and the air.I am reminded of the saying from Marcus Aurelius,That which is not good for the bee-hive cannot be good for the bees.So, I am a commonsist: I reject political authority that does not derive from a bottom-up management of our world as a network of commons. At every scale, the rules of the commons must shape human activities that impact the commons, most importantly, the views of those closest to a commons should carry the most weight. But just as the watershed of Fishkill Creek (where I live in Beacon NY) drains into the Hudson, the actions that we who live along the creek can impact others in the greater watershed, so polluting the creek has impacts at the greater scale. However, if we manage local fishing in the creek to maintain fish levels, and avoid importing aggressive exotic fish, we are likely to not damage the greater watershed.By acting as responsible members at the bottommost scale in the watershed, we also are acting in the interests of all, at the greater watershed of the Hudson. And those outside our watershed should not have much of a say in what we do locally, unless we are keeping our own watershed cleaning by trucking pollutants to the Connecticut watershed.By the opposite logic, however, those that are failing to follow the principles of the commons – for example, companies that spill PCBs into the Hudson, or countries that are spewing CO2 into the atmosphere and warming the earth–are immoral, no matter what their motivations for doing so may be. And those closest to the mess being made have the right and obligation to compel them to stop. And here’s where this system demonstrates that the world is upside down: if a political order is organized in such a way that actions based on the principles of the commons can be blocked by those less close to the commons it is flawed, and probably immoral. For example, the State of NY should not be able to compel a municipality to allow fracking, which could damage the land to the detriment of all. On the other hand, if Beacon citizens voted in favor of fracking along Fishkill Creek, they can be overruled by the greater Hudson River watershed citizenship (especially those downstream and nearby), since the possibility of damage to the greater watershed is relatively high.Consider the XL Pipeline from this perspective, and it’s clear the Feds should not don’t have the moral right to compel Nebraska – or any other region – to accept the XL Pipeline for the benefit of energy companies, or even for ‘energy independence’. It’s patently immoral.The zeroth rule, Leopold’s golden rule, creates a massive check on activities that threaten the greater good, and do not allow a substitution of money or other compensation in exchange for the possible or actual damage. So, join the commonsists, and resist the political order that places anything ahead of the perpetuation of the commons we – and posterity – rely on."

One version, Laundroid, builds on the idea of a laundroid hive mind: the units get smarter, collectively, by sharing knowledge about folding:Laundroid has an insert box and four smaller drawers. Dump in up to 30 items of clean clothing and it goes to work.“The robot arm picks up the clothes one by one and then artificial intelligence recognizes if this is a T-shirt or pants or pajamas,” Shin Sakane, Laundroid’s inventor, said in a Skype interview from Japan.The biggest technical challenge for both Laundroid and FoldiMate is for the machine to know what it is holding. Because clothes are shapeless in a pile, and the robot arm will grab each item sometimes by the edge, sometimes by a midpoint, “there will be no times that a garment will be picked up in the same shape,” Guy Hayazaki, a Laundroid spokesman, said.The Laundroids will work as a team. The concept is that, using a Wi-Fi connection, the networked robot brain will connect to a server that is constantly learning best folding methods for each type of clothing by downloading data from all the other Laundroids. This hive mind promises to be able to differentiate between T-shirts, overalls and rompers, fold each according to its needs and sort them into separate piles for members of the household.Slowly. In the first-generation Laundroid, image analysis of each garment takes up to 10 minutes; folding only a minute or two. But that adds up to nearly a full workday for a full load." True link

It should be much higher, according to economic thought. But maybe there’s another mystery behind the mystery: productivity.We’re not getting much more productiveOther economists find different reasons for lagging wage growth. One is that gains in productivity — a measure of how much a given worker or machine can produce — have also been sluggish of late. That is a worrying sign, since productivity gains are what really determines improvements in wealth and living standards over generations.But blaming productivity for slow wages is not a full explanation, because economists in turn debate the reasons behind sluggish productivity. Some fault measurement issues. Some point a finger at government policies that have failed to encourage investments in machinery and technology. Others say it could just be because of natural ebbs and flows in innovation.[…]In addition to trends in productivity, weak growth in wages may reflect the difficulty workers have asserting their bargaining position in the current environment, Lawson said.A dramatic decline in unionization in recent decades has left workers less able to bargain with company owners for pay increases. At the same time, globalization has allowed companies to be more mobile than ever before. If labor gets too expensive in one location, companies can just move.Neil Irwin dug into productivity recently, as I reviewed in Why is Productivity such a mystery?:I recommend reading Irwin’s analysis, but to summarize, he basically suggests three scenarios:1) Depressing — Irwin doesn’t use the term ‘postnormal’ but he should have. In this scenario, we are in new territory where productivity is inherently lower than in the past, and will remain so.He doesn’t say it, but the nature of the modern world, where everything has become deeply connected to everything else, may have incorporated a subtle friction into the economic engine. As a result, it may require greater investment to make any headway in productivity.Also, as Irwin points out, new ideas are getting harder to find (see The Hidden Economics of Ideas) so the level of investment and time needed to find breakthroughs is steadily increasing.2) Neutral — Perhaps we just don’t know how to measure ‘productivity’, anymore. Or said differently, the nature of work may have changed so much that the tools we use don’t measure all the outputs.3) Optimistic — While companies may be making greater investments in some areas — like driverless cars — the impact and payoff from those investments is all in the future. Additionally, more effort may be directed toward changing the way we work, or the structure of delivering value to customers. Maybe this is an era of transformation, where only after a long hard slog will we finally see the rewards of efforts made in the present.The reality is that how and what we consider productivity is changing faster than new techniques to improve it, so we need to consider how to hold and use the ruler to measure productivity, because the ruler is changing at least as fast as everything else."

But unfortunately, when you dig into the numbers, it appears to fall very short of the kind of growth Mulvaney discussed.Just look at the overall figures. There are about 160 million Americans in the labor force, who together generate GDP growth of just under 2 percent. How much can another 6 million people do to raise the growth rate another 50 percent?“The math just doesn’t add up,” said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West Economics.As Josh Feinman, chief global economist at Deutsche Asset Management, points out, it’s highly unlikely the Trump administration can move all of those 6 million people into the labor force, anyway — for the same reason that it can never fully empty the ranks of the unemployed.“Even in a really strong labor market — just firing on all cylinders, white hot — why is the unemployment rate at 3 percent? The reason is you’ve got frictional unemployment,” he said. “There are jobs that people don’t know about. They might be in a different part of the country, or maybe they have a different skill set. So even in a labor market that’s, as I said, running flat out, the [U3] unemployment rate is not going to be zero.”I don’t know why we even parse this bullshit trying to find some kernel of reasoning in it. They are just making numbers up to justify the tax cuts and social safety net cuts they have decided they want. It’s not economics, it’s the culmination of winner-take-all thinking, where the White House and its backers, our conquerers, are treating the country and our economy like the spoils of war."

Contrary to perception, the nation is continuing to become more suburban, and at an accelerating pace. The prevailing pattern is growing out, not up, although with notable exceptions.Rural areas are lagging metropolitan areas in numerous measures, but within metro areas the suburbs are growing faster in both population and jobs.On the other hand, as anyone who has tried to rent an apartment or buy a condo in a big city knows, housing prices are climbing faster in urban neighborhoods than in the suburbs. And urban neighborhoods are younger and richer than they used to be, with more educated residents and fewer school-age children. Higher-wage jobs are increasingly in city centers, with urban retail catering to these well-paid workers and residents.This combination of faster population growth in outlying areas and bigger price increases in cities points to limited housing supply as a curb on urban growth, pushing people out to the suburbs. It’s a reminder that where people live reflects not only what they want — but also what’s available and what it costs.However, these broad national trends hide divergent local ones. A few large metro areas did, in fact, become more urban between 2010 and 2016. Of the 51 metro areas with more than one million people, average neighborhood density rose in 10 and fell in 41, according to census population data and U.S. Postal Service counts of occupied housing units. That is, four-fifths of large metro areas have become more suburban since 2010, while only one-fifth have become more urban.This article is quite factual, but fails at connecting the dots about the outcomes of density.Geoffrey West and Luis Bettencourt revealed the relationship between urban density and, on one hand, a decrease in physical resources per capita and on the other in increase in the output of social products, like patents and salary levels:Luis Bettencourt and Geoffrey West, Bigger Cities Make Do With Less (Scientific American, September 2011)This new, more quantitative science of cities is becoming possible because of the increasing availability of information—official statistics as well as novel measures of human and social activity—on cities and metropolitan areas worldwide.By sifting through this flood of data, covering thousands of cities around the world, we have unveiled several mathematical “laws” that explain how concentrating people in one place affects economic activity, return on infrastructure investment and social vitality. Despite the rich diversity of metropolitan regions across the U.S., China, Brazil and other nations, we found a remarkable universality in the way that socioeconomic characteristics increase with a city’s population. For example, if the population of a city is doubled, whether from 40,000 to 80,000 or from four million to eight million, we systematically see an average increase of around 15 percent in measures such as wages and patents produced per capita. If eight million people all live in one city, their economic output will typically be about 15 percent greater than if the same eight million people lived in two cities of half the size. We call this effect “superlinear scaling”: the socioeconomic properties of cities increase faster than a direct (or linear) relation to their population would predict.The data also reveal that cities’ use of resources follows a similar, though inverted, law. When the size of a city doubles, its material infrastructure—anything from the number of gas stations to the total length of its pipes, roads or electrical wires—does not. Instead these quantities rise more slowly than population size: a city of eight million typically needs 15 percent less of the same infrastructure than do two cities of four million each. This pattern is referred to as sublinear scaling. On average, the bigger the city, the more efficient its use of infrastructure, leading to important savings in materials, energy and emissions.[…]What we can say with certainty, however, is that increased population promotes more intense and frequent social interactions, occurrences that correlate with higher rates of productivity and innovation, as well as economic pressures that weed out inefficiencies. In a city with high rents, only activities that add substantial value can be profitable. These economic pressures push urbanites to come up with new forms of organizations, products and services that carry more value added. In turn, higher profitability, excellence and choice tend to attract more talent to the city, pushing rents higher still, fueling the need to find yet more productive activities. This feedback mechanism, in a nutshell, is the principal reason cities accelerate innovation, while diversifying and intensifying social and economic activity.So the real issue behind the increased or decreased densities of cities is not some lifestyle choice about the attractiveness of hipster cafes versus low-cost suburban real estate, it’s really about economic inputs and outputs: denser cities innovate more and consume less, per capita, than less dense ones.  It’s worth noting that this slip in density is correlated with low gasoline prices, so that the costs of commuting longer distances are low, too, with the exception of all the externalities built into low gas prices, like pollution, sprawl, wasted time, unnecessary parking, increased infrastructure, and so on. If we taxed gas to cover those externalities, density in those sprawling cities would likely start flowing the opposite way.So if you believe increased innovation and decreasing energy use are socially positive, then you should lean toward policies that would encourage density. And those who live or move to areas where density is falling, just be aware that the number of patents is also falling, along with your future salary." True link

The newest: tens or hundreds of millions owed to drivers based on how Uber treats revenue and taxes, which the company says it will repay:The ride-hailing service said it had been taking its cut from a figure including state taxes, rather than a pretax fare. If a passenger handed over $20, and $2 of that represented taxes, Uber’s commission was a percentage of the full $20, not of $18, as it should have been. Even at pocket change per ride, the cumulative difference was vast.“We are committed to paying every driver every penny they are owed — plus interest — as quickly as possible,” Rachel Holt, the company’s regional general manager for the United States and Canada, said in a statement.But Uber’s handling of passenger payments raises questions about a larger legal issue, potentially far more substantial: not the pocket-change difference in the commission but whether that entire $2 in taxes is improperly coming out of the drivers’ wallets.Uber’s contract with drivers appears to allow the company to deduct only its 25 percent commission, not taxes, from their fares. But a lawsuit filed by a drivers’ advocacy group in New York last year said the company was making its drivers swallow the tax burden — a practice the group said amounted to wage theft.Documents examined by The New York Times also point to such a practice, which could have cost drivers hundreds of millions of dollars.[…]Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the advocacy group, the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, said that “from the beginning, Uber built its business model on the assumption that ‘we hate taxes,’” and that it had long “passed this tax on to drivers.”In response to Uber’s acknowledgment of error on Tuesday, the advocacy group said in a statement that “Uber hasn’t just wrongly calculated its commission; it has been unlawfully taking the cost of sales tax and an injured-worker surcharge right out of driver pay.”Other jurisdictions, like Rhode Island and Massachusetts, also levy taxes or fees on ride-hailing services, but it is not clear how Uber collects those taxes.In New York, the company must reckon with a state sales tax of nearly 9 percent per ride, as well as a 2.5 percent “black car fund” surcharge to cover workers’ compensation and death benefits.This shows once again that Uber always deals from the bottom with a deck that they’ve rigged."

Most recent a $2 trillion math error where they count the savings of the miracle tax plan twice:One of the ways Donald Trump’s budget claims to balance the budget over a decade, without cutting defense or retirement spending, is to assume a $2 trillion increase in revenue through economic growth. This is the magic of the still-to-be-designed Trump tax cuts. But wait — if you recall, the magic of the Trump tax cuts is also supposed to pay for the Trump tax cuts. So the $2 trillion is a double-counting error.Trump has promised to enact “the biggest tax cut in history.” Trump’s administration has insisted, however, that the largest tax cut in history will not reduce revenue, because it will unleash growth. That is itself a wildly fanciful assumption. But that assumption has already become a baseline of the administration’s budget math. Trump’s budget assumes the historically yuge tax cuts will not lose any revenue for this reason — the added growth it will supposedly generate will make up for all the lost revenue.But then the budget assumes $2 trillion in higher revenue from growth in order to achieve balance after ten years. So the $2 trillion from higher growth is a double-count. It pays for the Trump cuts, and then it pays again for balancing the budget. Or, alternatively, Trump could be assuming that his tax cuts will not only pay for themselves but generate $2 trillion in higher revenue. But Trump has not claimed his tax cuts will recoup more than 100 percent of their lost revenue, so it’s simply an embarrassing mistake.It seems difficult to imagine how this administration could figure out how to design and pass a tax cut that could pay for itself when Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush failed to come anywhere close to doing so. If there is a group of economic minds with the special genius to accomplish this historically unprecedented feat, it is probably not the fiscal minds who just made a $2 trillion basic arithmetic error.If there was any doubt that Trump & Co don’t know what the fuck they are doing, this settles it.Hilariously, when asked about this glitch, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin responded like this:Harwood asks Mnuchin about double-counting gimmick: “This is a preliminary document that will be refined”  #FiscalSummit— David Wessel (@davidmwessel) May 23, 2017 " True link

Anywhereism’s days might be numbered (see Ism’s):Nearly 70% of U.S. office spaces are open-concept, according to the International Facility Management Association, compared with 64% two decades ago. Led by CEOs such as Michael Bloomberg, AB InBev NV’s Carlos Brito and Zappos.com Inc.’s Tony Hsieh, more executives have ditched the corner office for an open desk to project camaraderie with the masses.But as employees and managers squeeze closer together, productivity and morale have suffered. In a review of more than 100 studies of work environments, British researchers found that despite improving communication in some instances, open-office spaces hurt workers’ motivation and ability to focus.Employees seeking privacy resort to conference-room squatting or ducking into “focus” booths, quiet refuges that companies are increasingly building into open offices.CEOs have the license to go further. For seven years, Blake Harvey and his employees at his New York communications firm, Lawrence Blake Group, toiled together in co-working spaces. His staff sometimes felt self-conscious working under their boss’s gaze. When he was worried about the business, there was no hiding. “If I was a little down, they could see that, and that affects the whole team,” he said.[…]“When you’re in a territory that’s clearly yours, you perform better,” says Sally Augustin, an environmental psychologist and principal at La Grange Park, Ill.-based consulting firm Design With Science.Even watching a boss and co-worker move into a separate space for a meeting can be distracting, she adds.“People’s minds never go to ‘Bob must be getting a promotion,’” she says. “It’s, ‘Bob must be in trouble. This is the beginning of the end for Bob.’”Steelcase’s Jim Keane says having his pod isn’t about status or privilege. ‘This is a space where you do certain kinds of work.’>He has since moved to a 5-by-8-foot pod in the company’s innovation center. He retreats to it when he needs to focus or switch mental gears between meetings. Otherwise, he is out on the floor, with customers and employees, or in other enclaves for meetings.“It’s not about status or privilege,” he says of the pod, a prototype with still-exposed two-by-fours. “This is a space where you do certain kinds of work.”Well, it’s not about privilege when everybody can retreat to a pod in the innovation center in  order to actually get some work down without distractions."

In this sense, the challenge that 2016 presents to conservatives in particular is not a function of questions about Donald Trump’s character or personal fitness for the presidency, though those questions should certainly concern all Americans. The distinct additional challenge for conservatives is, rather, a function of the way in which Trump’s victory highlighted the weakness of the self-understanding of conservatives as masters and possessors of the Republican Party and the inadequacies of the arguments, policies, and ideals that conservatives have sought to champion. The election has thus left conservatives in a position to pursue the policy agenda we have trumpeted for years and yet should leave us unsure about whether it is the right agenda for this time in America, or the one that voters desire. This year should leave us asking hard questions, which is not what winning usually feels like.The reasons for this peculiar ambiguity cut to the heart of the lessons that 2016 should help America learn and force us to confront some challenging implications of this ­election—challenging for both Trump’s backers and his critics on the right. Confronting those implications should also mean confronting an always challenging and fundamental set of questions: What are conservatives for now? And how can we best be of service to the country?Failing to ask these questions has contributed much to the troubles facing conservatives. And asking them now might be the way to use the exceptional opportunity conservatives suddenly face and to mitigate the grave dangers that have come along with it.[…]This perceptive description helps clarify some of the challenge today’s right confronts. But perhaps it is not quite correct to say that the Americans who coalesced around Trump (especially before he was the Republican nominee, when they had other right-leaning options) cannot be named or identified. They are, in many respects, a coalition of the alienated. Trump’s appeal, and his victory, had a great deal to do with his ability to give voice to a growing (and in key respects surely justified) alienation from the dominant streams of the culture, economy, and politics in America.“Alienated” need not be a putrid, Marxist designation. The great twentieth-century sociologist Robert Nisbet defined ­alienation as “the state of mind that can find a social order remote, incomprehensible, or fraudulent; beyond real hope or desire; inviting apathy, boredom, or even hostility.” This is precisely how Trump and many of his most vocal supporters frequently spoke about America over the past year.The vague feeling that what had become of our society was somehow remote and incomprehensible—that it was insane, or at the very least not America as we knew it—was a prominent feature of the kind of frustration that many early Trump supporters articulated. The idea that there was something fraudulent about our social order and its institutions was everywhere in Trump’s rhetoric—directed at various points to the electoral process, the media, the political parties, the legal system, the judiciary, the IRS, the FBI, and on and on among our institutions. The sense that this incomprehensible fraud perpetrated on the public by its own elites had robbed America of hope was key to the willingness of many on the right to overlook Trump’s own shortcomings and welcome the potential for disruption that he introduced.[…]Trump’s appeal to American greatness struck a patriotic nerve among some of his supporters and was certainly received in some quarters as a much-needed call to restore the nation’s dignity and strength. In this respect, it appealed to some sentiments, and to some voters, frequently drawn to conservative politics. But what was new about Trump’s appeal, and what ultimately seemed most powerful about it, had more to do with a kind of partial reaction against the character of liberalism (indeed liberal democracy) in our time. It was, to be sure, a reaction in the name of the honor of the citizens today’s elites treat with contempt, the workers today’s economy treats as dispensable, the traditions today’s culture treats as primitive. It was a partial reaction, however, because Trump generally channeled the frustrations of these Americans but not their aspirations. He shared their resentments far more than their commitments, let alone their piety or their devotions, and so he tended to translate their yearnings into alienation of the sort that drew many other Americans to him.Alienation can sometimes make for a powerful organizing principle for an electoral coalition, especially when hostility overpowers apathy among the sentiments it breeds. But it does not make for a natural organizing principle for a governing coalition. The sense of lacking a stake in the nation’s governing institutions—the feeling that those institutions are remote and unresponsive—makes it difficult to know what to do when they fall into your possession.[…]Angelo Codevilla, the renowned scholar of international relations, argued in September that, regardless of who won the election, “the republic established by America’s Founders is probably gone.” This is a function of the path the country had long traveled. “Electing either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump cannot change that trajectory. Because each candidate represents constituencies hostile to republicanism, each in its own way, these individuals are not what this election is about.” Rather, the election was about somehow breaking out of that path and at least creating the minimal possibility of a reversal—a risk worth taking given that the only alternative was the conclusion of a terminal decline.[…]At the end of his final book, American Babylon, in which he articulated many of the deepest concerns about our culture and society that animate many on the right, the late Richard John Neuhaus acknowledged the permanent temptation to see our own time as the exception to this rule, and noted the importance of resisting it. He wrote:We seek to be faithful in a time not of our choosing but of our testing. We resist the hubris of presuming that it is the definitive time and place of historical promise or tragedy, but it is our time and place. It is a time of many times: a time for dancing, even if to the songs of Zion in a foreign land; a time for walking together, unintimidated when we seem to be a small and beleaguered band; a time for rejoicing in momentary triumphs, and for defiance in momentary defeats; a time for persistence in reasoned argument, never tiring in proposing to the world a more excellent way.[…]We cannot dismiss the widespread alienation and despair laid bare by this election as simply an error. One of the virtues of democracy is that it forces us to take the worries of our fellow citizens seriously and therefore compels us to confront real problems we might otherwise ignore. The alienation that prevails among so many fellow citizens is a warning that our economic arrangements, cultural norms, and political system—and indeed our elite institutions in general—have grown distant and unresponsive, and are leaving far too many Americans feeling despised and disrespected, and lacking a stake in their own society. Simply embodying that alienation is not a solution, but ignoring it and just complacently repeating the stale policies, arguments, and slogans that have dominated our politics for decades would exacerbate the problem.The trouble is that Donald Trump’s circle on the right tends to consist largely (albeit not exclusively of course) of a peculiar combination of the alienated and the complacent—outsiders with a keen sense that the system has failed them and doesn’t belong to them but no clear vision of how to transform it, and insiders who believe a clean rerun of Reaganism is all that America lacks. Alienation and complacency are in tension, but they can cooperate, each for its own reason, in treating disruption as a sufficient substitute for transformation and contempt as a stand-in for reform.The space between alienation and complacency is where solutions must come from. But filling that gap requires a political vision that takes the roots of today’s alienation seriously as problems to be addressed. Such a vision would seek to help more Americans respect our institutions by making those institutions more respectable, more functional, and more responsive and adaptive. It would seek to take Americans seriously and to honor them as human persons—not helpless recipients of benefits, not interchangeable units of labor, not radically isolated pursuers of pleasure, and not bundles of abstract identities, but as men and women who desire to flourish and to thrive and to be needed and responsible and to belong.[…]The past year should leave us all with the distinct impression that we have reached the end of an era in American politics, even if it remains far from clear what the next era will look like. The electorate is clearly dissatisfied with the options the two parties have long offered it. That is what made this a protest election above all. No one can yet quite say exactly where this dissatisfaction points, though of course we must try to learn what we can on that front from Trump’s success. But the pattern of dissatisfaction—and particularly of the dissatisfaction of each party’s base with its own party’s offerings—is surely suggestive.On the left, voters were dissatisfied with the Democratic Party’s inclination to abstract away from their needs, interests, and identities. They nearly chose an angry, elderly socialist rather than opt for the bland technocracy of today’s Progressivism. On the right, voters were dissatisfied with the rote, sloganeering conservatism of much of the GOP, which repeats the ends of Ronald Reagan’s sentences but has long ago forgotten how they started. In both cases, abstractions about freedom seem less satisfying than they used to be, while gestures in the direction of solidarity are deeply compelling even when they are not fully worked out.Like I said, a good set of observations, deeply considered, by a thoughtful conservative. But I drop off here, since his conclusions fail for me. Contorting a metaphor that Levin himself suggests, I appreciate where his sentences begin, but can’t follow him to their ends, which is always some plea for orthodoxy, some reaffirmation of conservative principles, some slightly oiled version of ‘everyone for themselves’.And finally, Levin misses the big shift at play, the realignment of politics away from left versus right, and toward metropolitan neoliberal globalism of the elites versus peripheral protectionist localism.

I guess I am not surprised, considering that a decade ago they gave up on building the best software, and in the past few years they’ve given up on building the best laptops and PCs. Next, will they give up on building the best phones? We’ll know when the Apple 8 comes out.Meanwhile back at Project titan:Apple Inc. has drastically scaled back its automotive ambitions, leading to hundreds of job cuts and a new direction that, for now, no longer includes building its own car, according to people familiar with the project.Hundreds of members of the car team, which comprises about 1,000 people, have been reassigned, let go, or have left of their own volition in recent months, the people said, asking not to be identified because the moves aren’t public. New leadership of the initiative, known internally as Project Titan, has re-focused on developing an autonomous driving system that gives Apple flexibility to either partner with existing carmakers, or return to designing its own vehicle in the future, the people also said. Apple has kept staff numbers in the team steady by hiring people to help with the new focus, according to another person.Apple executives have given the car team a deadline of late next year to prove the feasibility of the self-driving system and decide on a final direction, two of the people said. Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr declined to comment.The new shift and deadline come after months of strategy disagreements, leadership flux and supply chain challenges inside Apple’s unmarked car labs in Sunnyvale, California, a short drive from its Cupertino headquarters. Oh yes. See the dynamic: Apple executive are sitting in judgment on the whole idea of driverless vehicles. It’s not the executive leading the charge with a vision of the future: they are sitting in judgment. So that means ‘no’ until every reason why not can be knocked down.I’m happy now I dumped Apple stock. Maybe I should start shorting them.This is a firm with hundreds of billions to invest. Don’t they believe in the idea of driverless? If they do, and they turn their back, does that mean they don’t believe they can do it? That they can’t win? Do they believe they can win somewhere else? Where?It’s time for Tim Cook to retire. I had hoped they’d acquire Tesla, and make Musk CEO of Apple. Maybe still possible." True link

We surveyed hundreds of employees and had them score their organization not only on individual engagement measures (e.g. I know what is expected of me at work) but on collective conditions, too (e.g. My organization welcomes and promotes diversity). Question after question, we saw responses correlated to the respondents’ position within the firm. We’ve included two (of many) plots of this below. The line is the trend of all responses and the blue dots represent the 25 organizations which had highest overall participation rate in our survey.So what does this mean?If you’re a leader, it’s imperative that you challenge your own perceptions of the organization. However you feel about things, your people feel worse about them. Moreover, because perception is reality, your organization likely has differing and competing realities and cultures. That multiplicity will work against you as you struggle to adapt to changing conditions outside of the firm, so you must work to align and unify your culture. Here, quantifying your commitment to a better, shared culture is a powerful first step in uniting cultures. Or maybe it’s inevitable that those with less power are less aligned with the political ambitions of the more powerful. That’s one way to deconstruct ‘cultural alignment’. After all, the implication of alignment is that the ideal cultural norms and aspirations are set by those higher up, and alignment is something the lower downs are supposed to do. So the charts don’t show companies ‘rotting from the tail’, it just shows that there is a latency – or resistance – between the upper and lower parts of the pyramid.When we finally shift to networked cultural forms, we’ll accept that people are always out of alignment, and just hope that those working together can agree to move generally in the same direction. Besides, groupthink is a trap, not a benefit."
