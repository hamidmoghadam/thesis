He also complained that ‚Äúour generation is so entitled‚Äù - because all of his stinking rich friends just got cushy jobs at their parents‚Äô companies. He seriously had no fucking idea that this was a thing exclusive to the rich. So yeah, I definitely think this is 100% true.

Or like, anything about child development or where misbehavior stems from.¬† So, as someone who went through childhood development classes in college, works with kids for a living, and knows multiple people who specialized in childhood education, here are some pointers when you are working with kids: 1. Model emotional response for kids. Children are learning how to recognize and respond to their own emotions. All the way up through high school, children‚Äôs brains are still developing, and the emotions they are learning to process become more complex. So with really young kids, the easiest way to help them with this is to model emotional self awareness and self care.¬† ‚ÄúOh wow, mommy is feeling angry because the cat made a mess. I‚Äôm going to clean this mess and then go sit in my room in the quiet for a short break so I feel better.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou know, I am feeling very sad about not going to the park because it is raining. I bet some hot chocolate and a book would make me feel better.‚Äù ‚ÄùHuh, I‚Äôm feeling kind of cranky and hungry, but daddy won‚Äôt be home for dinner for another hour. I bet I‚Äôll feel better if I eat a little piece apple while we wait.‚Äù¬† 2. Understand what causes child frustration and work to preempt it.¬† -Transitions (from one activity to another, getting in the car, etc) can be stressful, especially if the activity or location they are leaving is fun. Give kids a warning when this is going to happen. With young kids, give them about 5-15 minutes of warning (‚Äù10 minutes until we are going to leave the park and go home. Do your last thing.‚Äù), with older kids, just give them a time frame. (We are can play at McDonalds for 30 minutes, but then we have to go grocery shopping, ok?)¬†Not being able to communicate what they want to is frustrating. Babies can learn simplified baby sign language months before they are verbal. Kids may not know the words for what they are trying to say. Be patient and help them find the right words. On a similar note, don‚Äôt ignore kids. If you really can‚Äôt respond to their question right away because of something else, at least tell the¬†‚ÄúYes, I heard your question. I‚Äôll answer you as soon as I‚Äôm done talking on the phone.‚ÄùNot being able to make choices or having too much choice can be overwhelming. Give kids a limited, reasonable selection of choices.¬†‚ÄúDo you want apple slices or juicy pears on the side for lunch?‚Äù is much better than¬†‚ÄúWhat do you want with your sandwich?‚Äù or just giving them apple slices.¬†‚ÄúDo you want to give grandpa a hug or a high five?‚Äù is better than demanding they hug grandpa right away.¬†3. Understand that kids are people to. They will get hungry, tired, an annoyed just like adults do. Sometimes you have to be flexible and give them time to self care. Talk to them, explain things to them, let them be people and not just dolls. ¬†‚ÄúBecause I said so‚Äù is really unhelpful for a growing kid.¬†‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt buy Fruit Loops today because we are already getting Frosted Flakes. We only need one cereal at a time.‚Äù is going to do you a lot more favors.¬†‚ÄúDon‚Äôt pick up the glass snow globe. It belongs to grandma and can break easy. She would be sad if we broke it on accident.‚Äù is better than¬†‚Äúdon‚Äôt touch that.‚Äù¬†  And look, no parent is perfect. No baby sitter, no teacher, no care taker is going to be awesome all the time. And no kid is going to be perfect. They will cry and have tantrums, and not be able to tell you what they need, and be stubborn sometimes. Sometimes they need space, or quiet time. Sometimes they need attention and validation.¬†  But kids learn from every interaction they have, so adults need to make the effort to show all the love, and patience, and empathy, and thoughtfulness we want them to learn.¬† " False text

And you can say that polyamorous people have more than one, and aromantic soulmates are platonic in nature‚Äìerasing aplatonic aros in the process‚Äìbut that‚Äôs just a Band-Aid on the issue. The Soulmate Postulate is more insidious. It‚Äôs a mask for aphobia (you just haven‚Äôt met The One).

Especially lesbophobia (because they just haven‚Äôt met the Right Man). ‚ÄúBut surely that‚Äôs not the fault of the Soulmate Postulate, and everything will be fine once homophobia is eradicated.‚Äù Okay, but no. Because the Soulmate Postulate still creates damaging mindsets when going into relationships. Because you‚Äôre out there looking for the one (or, I guess, three or so if you‚Äôre polyamorous) person who can make you *really* happy. The person who *completes* you. You‚Äôre putting potential partners on a pedestal, and if they don‚Äôt meet these unrealistic expectations then it obviously wasn‚Äôt meant to be. I never even considered I was aro in high school because I thought I was just being logical; if the purpose of dating was to find The One with whom you would spend your entire life‚Ä¶ what was the purpose of investing emotionally in finding something that I would be highly unlikely to find in my small high school. It‚Äôs all fine and well if you want to go looking for the one person in the world who can *really* complete your life or whatever, but these messages are being broadcast to kids at very young ages.  High schoolers get together in movies, the credits roll, and we‚Äôre led to believe that all of the fourteen-year-olds that started dating will be together forever. Cinderella‚Äôs only known her prince for, like, three nights at most, but it‚Äôs okay because they‚Äôre destined for each other. Soulmate AUs are bandied about on this blue hellhole as though soulmates were just A Thing, and the AU bit is that you only see in color when you meet them or something. And this is presented as positive or something. Like‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt really expect to accomplish much with this. But can we at least start with not portraying the Soulmate Postulate as some universal constant that is the Height of Romance? ‚ÄòCause I‚Äôd really appreciate it and I‚Äôm sure there are other people who would, too.

During a speech to Muslims in Saudi Arabia, Trump referred to ‚ÄúIslamic extremism‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúIslamist extremism,‚Äù as had been written. While that may sound like a distinction without a difference, Reuters explains: The term ‚ÄúIslamist extremism‚Äù refers to Islamism as a political movement rather than Islam as a religion, a distinction that the Republican president had frequently criticized the administration of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, for making. Trump often referred to ‚ÄúIslamic extremism‚Äù and criticized President Obama for using the term ‚ÄúIslamist extremism.‚Äù But, because he is playing nicey-nicey with the Saudis, he tried to modulate his rhetoric, but he failed. His apparent exhaustion put him right back into campaign mode. That wasn‚Äôt the only symptom of his exhaustion. Following the speech, Trump was supposed to appear at the Tweeps Forum. Instead, he sent his daughter Ivanka. Trump is 70-years-old. His diet consists of chocolate cake, double scoops of ice cream on top of a cream pie, Kentucky Fried Chicken (and other fast food) and well-done steak with ketchup. As for exercise, well, he doesn‚Äôt. He thinks exercise kills people. You‚Äôd think he would be able to handle his nine-day trip. He claims he only needs three to four hours sleep a night.  It‚Äôs understandable that a man of his age and his fitness level would have trouble keeping up with the rigors of such an ambitious trip, but one can‚Äôt help but note the hypocrisy, especially after saying this about Hillary Clinton:‚ÄúTo be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina,‚Äù Trump said in the first presidential debate. ‚ÄúYou have to be able to negotiate our trade deals ‚Ä¶ with Japan, with Saudi Arabia.‚Äù  Source: Washington Examiner Trump is just one country in and he‚Äôs exhausted.  Three days into the trip.  Also ¬†is daughter should never be filling in. When a president is sick they don‚Äôt have their children do their job they have people whose job it is to step in do it. So ignoring for the moment that he shouldn‚Äôt even be exhausted and if he really is too fucking bad, his kid shouldn‚Äôt be doing the job of the president. " False link

For the new far-right movement, ‚Äúirony has a strategic function. It allows people to disclaim a real commitment to far-right ideas while still espousing them.‚Äù Marwick says that from the early 2000s, on message boards like 4chan, calculatedly offensive language and imagery have been used to ‚Äúprovoke strong reactions in outsiders‚Äù. Calling all users ‚Äúfags‚Äù, or creating memes using gross racial stereotypes, ‚Äúserves a gate-keeping function, in that it keeps people out of these spaces, many of which are very easy to access‚Äù. Violating the standards of political correctness and the rules of polite interactions ‚Äúalso functions as an act of rebellion‚Äù in spaces drenched in adolescent masculinity.

For them, it‚Äôs simply a means to fluster their grandparents.‚Äù What Yiannopoulos left out, according to Marwick, is that these spaces increasingly became attractive to sincere white supremacists. They offered them venues for recruitment, and new methods for popularising their ideas. ‚ÄúFascism is more or less a social taboo. It‚Äôs unacceptable in modern society. Humour or irony is one of the ways that they can put forward their affective positions without having to fall back on any affirmative ideological positions.‚Äù He adds: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre putting forward the anger, the sense of betrayal, the need for revenge, the resentment, the violence.

Doctor finds anecdotal evidence that people are passing kidney stones after riding on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad at Disney World 2. Doctor makes 3-D model of kidney, complete with stones and urine (his own), takes it on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad 60 times 3.¬†‚ÄúThe stones passed 63.89 percent of the time while the kidneys were in the back of the car. When they were in the front, the passage rate was only 16.67 percent. That‚Äôs based on only 60 rides on a single coaster, and Wartinger guards his excitement in the journal article: ‚ÄòPreliminary study findings support the anecdotal evidence that a ride on a moderate-intensity roller coaster could benefit some patients with small kidney stones.‚Äô‚Äù 4.¬†‚ÄúSome rides are going to be more advantageous for some patients than other rides. So I wouldn‚Äôt say that the only ride that helps you pass stones is Big Thunder Mountain. That‚Äôs grossly inaccurate.‚Äù 5.¬†‚ÄúHis advice for now: If you know you have a stone that‚Äôs smaller than five millimeters, riding a series of roller coasters could help you pass that stone before it gets to an obstructive size and either causes debilitating colic or requires a $10,000 procedure to try and break it up. And even once a stone is broken up using shock waves, tiny fragments and ‚Äúdust‚Äù remain that need to be passed. The coaster could help with that, too.‚Äù SCIENCE: IT WORKS  Update:¬† ‚ÄúIn all, we used 174 kidney stones of varying shapes, sizes and weights to see if each model worked on the same ride and on two other roller coasters,‚Äù Wartinger said. ‚ÄúBig Thunder Mountain was the only one that worked. We tried Space Mountain and Aerosmith‚Äôs Rock ‚Äòn‚Äô Roller Coaster and both failed.‚ÄùWartinger went on to explain that these other rides are too fast and too violent with a G-force that pins the stone into the kidney and doesn‚Äôt allow it to pass.‚ÄúThe ideal coaster is rough and quick with some twists and turns, but no upside down or inverted movements,‚Äù he said.

Some new data suggests that what you do after a training session may have an influence on how much your dog remembers and how well he subsequently performs.¬†  However any emotionally arousing situation occurring immediately after a  training session can cause the body to create and secrete such  chemicals. One positive way to do this is to engage in playful activity  with the dog.   A ‚ÄúPlay Group‚Äù of eight dogs experienced a 30 minute session of intense  playful activity consisting of a 10 minute walk, 10 minutes of off lead  play (which could include fetching a ball, chasing after Frisbees, or  playing tug-of-war depending on each dog‚Äôs preferred play style), and  then a final 10 minute walk. For comparison purposes a ‚ÄúRest Group‚Äù of  eight dogs simply spent the 30 minutes after training resting on a dog  bed while the researcher engaged their owner in a conversation to  prevent further attention or interaction with the dog.    The dogs who had received the play session after training relearned the  task 40% faster than the dogs who rested after the training sessions (an  average number of 26 training trials for the play group versus 43  trials for the rest group). Thus it appears that the playful activity  following the teaching sessions helped to consolidate or ‚Äústamp in‚Äù the  memories of what the dogs had learned.¬†  The take-home message from this new research seems to be that the simple  addition of a session of playful activity after a period of training  can significantly add to the effectiveness and performance of a dog who  is learning a new set of skills.
