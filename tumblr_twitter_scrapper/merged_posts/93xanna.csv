His entire song “The Last” really touches on this: a word said like habit, oh, I don’t give a shit, I don’t give a fuckthose words are all words I use to hide my weak selfthat time I want to erase, that’s right, the memories I want to erase of that day I had that concertI was afraid of people, so I hid in the bathroom and stared at myself and in “So Far Away”: I’m in so much pain and lonliness but people around me keeping telling me to regain my consciousnessI try to vent my anger but I only got myself so what’s the point of venting my angerI’m scared to open my eyes everyday and start breathing these lyrics from ‘At Dawn’ also illustrate this: I pretend I’m not lonely, I pretend I’m not sufferingI pretend I’m okay for no reason, meaninglessly I pretend to be strongdon’t come over the wall I’ve put up in front of myselfdon’t throw me off this island in this wide sea  he also talks about his struggles during his trainee days and i dont think he’s ever talked in depth about this period of his life. this mixtape gives us some insight about him moving to seoul, getting a part time job to afford the cost of living in the city, going to school dead tired after work, and still training with big hit to live out his dreams was I needy for success? No just needy for moneyit’d been a long time since I forgot the words ‘in style’I practiced at night and went to my part time job at dawnthen even if I dragged that tired body to school I just sleptI became 20 that way, the sight of the graduation room was suspicious and the fact that he admits he puts up a front: I hide the self that’s behind my defensive postureI hide myself completely like I’ve become a criminal, alwaysI can’t even take one step outside the dorm that’s like a prison  all of these are reasons im so moved. because it really highlights how idols only show one side of themselves to the camera, and fans can never really know them fully. we only know the version of bts’ min yoongi that he wants to show us through shows and broadcasts.  behind every idol rapper who succeedsthere’s a weak self standing, it’s a little dangerousI fall sometimes again into depression and compulsionhell no, anyway I don’t even know if that’s the real me but through his music? through his mixtape, he’s trying to show us another side of him, and i’m so thankful that he’s opened up to his worldwide audience. this takes courage. talking openly about your hardships and your weaknesses to people who look up to you, that takes some damn courage. so thank you, yoongi, for opening up to your fans.  " False text
