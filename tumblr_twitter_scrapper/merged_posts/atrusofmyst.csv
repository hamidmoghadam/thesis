We asked her to write about the experience. In the medieval period in Western Europe, books were copied by hand onto specially prepared animal skins. The animals used for this purpose in the British Isles were sheep and cows, and in order to turn their pelts into pages these animals would be killed, their blood would be drained, they would be skinned, and then these skins would be soaked and stretched, scraped and dried, and polished and trimmed to make them into usable pages. Jesus College MS 37, a copy of Iohannus Diaconus’ Vita Sancti Gregorii, is a manuscript with some very unusual pages. A few of its folios preserve faint traces of their animal past in the form of stained blood vessels. Such stained vessels are very rare - transparent vein structures can sometimes be seen on a manuscript page like contour lines on a map, but to see the vessels still outlined in blood is much more unusual, and is possibly the result of the animals being bled too slowly after they had been killed. Making parchment was a skilled job and sometimes imperfect pages were used in medieval books simply because the skins, however flawed, were too precious to waste. As I was reading Jesus College 37 I was very excited to see such an unusual manuscript phenomenon “in the flesh.” - Sarah Gilbert, Bodleian reader.   " False text

atrusofmyst 160997745929 "2017-05-23 21:39:07 GMT" https://atrusofmyst.tumblr.com/post/160997745929/making-players-vulnerable "sandgame: atrusofmyst:  sandgame:  One of my big narrative problems with Uru was that it made the players invulnerable, which kills a lot of opportunities for tension. Whether it’s being just a little bit worried about whether that 60-foot drop to the Journey Door in Gahreesen is a good idea or not actively chasing around the bahro linking into the city literally four months after they killed a teenage girl, being vulnerable has the opportunity to keep players on their toes a bit. Besides, it’s not like this invulnerability is a feature of the Myst games – you could still die, you just had to do something that was pretty fundamentally stupid, and those opportunities only largely presented themselves right at the end of the game. Since Uru and SAND are persistent-world MMOs, it’s not really possible to impose that sort of permanent failure state on the player, but I think there’s a way to build a system that requires players to pay more attention to the environment, and which provides the opportunity for heightened narrative tension, even if the negative outcomes are only temporary. Uru’s panic-link system will still be in place to prevent players from doing anything that would obviously kill them (like jumping into lava), but what about things that fall short of that criterion? What about smaller (but still serious) falls? What about linking into an arctic blizzard in nothing but your underwear? To that end, I’ve designed a system that lets the game impose consequences on players for foolish or reckless behavior. It’s sort of an amalgam of the Consequences mechanic from Unwritten (and other FATE RPGs) and pieces of the debuff/condition system in other MMOs like Guild Wars 2. Players have two “impact” bars (for lack of a better term), Conditions and Consequences, which work to indicate how much harm a player has incurred, and provide good visual feedback for their current condition. The system itself is fairly straightforward, but it requires a fair amount of explanation, so follow me after the break for the nitty gritty. Keep reading  I am partially in favour of giving damage/consequences to players, but after several years of Uru and TSW I’m really against reintroducing fall damage. There are already panic links if you fall where you shouldn’t.   I wrestled with this for a long time, honestly. For years, I had intended to follow Uru and stay away from player vulnerability entirely, but the more I thought about the way that players behaved in light of their invincibility, and the more I started to develop the idea of the environments themselves being an active part of the gameplay, the more sense it made to introduce some kind of consequences system, and the less sense it made for falling to be excluded from it. (I’ll have more about environments as gameplay in an upcoming post.) If I can get hurt by bitter cold, or standing in a burning fire, or going into the Descent’s magma chamber without an oxygen mask, or having a rock fall on my head, or hugging a rebel bahro, then why can’t I get hurt by falling down? I guess you could avoid that particular question entirely by designing every level without any precipitous drops, or by adding invisible walls everywhere, but that violates my goal of making the environments more interesting to explore, not less. Putting aside the question of internal consistency, though, relying exclusively on panic linking and invisible walls will also inevitably lead to frustrating inconsistencies in their application. In Uru, there is no consistent distance that you can fall without panic linking, and there are no consistent rules for which ledges you can walk off of and which ones you can’t.   If I can’t jump into the Gahreesen jungle without panic linking, why should I expect to be able to drop 80 feet onto solid rock to reach its journey door, and how am I expected to know that those two actions will have different outcomes? The rest of the game works against itself here by making that sort of jump seem inadvisable, and thus more likely for there to be some other (actually nonexistent) way to get there. Further, why can I not jump into the cavern lake without panic linking, but swimming in Ahnonay is fine? If I can jump over to Relto’s clock tower island, why can’t I jump across a broken section of walkway in Er’cana? Why are there invisible walls along the bridge in Eder Kemo where I wouldn’t need to panic link if I fell off, but not along the pathway in Kadish’s vault where I do? It’s all weirdly arbitrary, and that inconsistency in the game world’s underlying rules ultimately results in the very thing that panic linking was intended to reduce: player uncertainty. My intention is not to make falling damage into a punishing thing that you constantly have to struggle against to survive, or to use it as an excuse for more sadistic level design.   Rather, my goal is simply to round out the dangers from environmental hazards and provide a clear, consistent mechanism for judging the risk of a fall in advance.    The system’s damage curve will continue the long video game tradition of making the player’s character much more resilient than they would be in the real world, and the recovery process is mostly automatic.  Intentionally-designed falls will be easily survivable, and with proper planning, you can completely recover from even moderate harm by having first aid kits on your person when you go exploring. At a design level, accidental falls from high ledges can be mitigated with invisible “bumpers” (rather than walls) that stop players from just careening off of them, while still permitting intentional jumps and climb-downs. I also really want to avoid Uru’s habit of using panic links because you’ve gone “out of bounds” – while true map-outs will still trigger them, one of my goals is that if you can get there, you can go there. No more locking out whole sections of Ages behind arbitrary kill fields. If you want to explore, knock yourself out (assuming the fall doesn’t ;)).  I agree about the arbitrariness of panic links and invisible walls, but on the other hand there need to be helpful game mechanics to make up for the game limitations. Now I know this is all at the blue skies and planning stage so far, but unless you deliver the impossibly perfect game engine, our character will likely not have functioning hands - they’ll only be able to pick up what is scripted, climb with their hands where it’s scripted, tie a rope or move rocks where it’s scripted etc. So I think the optimal game experience is in the middle. Make it clear where a fall will be temporarily or long-term debilitating, while also allowing risk-free minor falls so you don’t have to work around the fact that the player would most likely learn to bring a ladder and rope along after a day or two of exploration.I like the idea of having to adapt clothing for the weather, but only if the cosmetic inventory is readily accessible without having to go through a hub or home Age, and we can save outfits. There’s preparing for the puzzle and the adventure, and there’s losing ten minute of game time linking to and fro to take a coat off." False text

Wow its almost like they were just talking about using it on themselves for individual reasons and you butted in to be an ass and be condescending because you think you’re superior for not using queer, then you called their identity a slur right to them. But that can’t possibly be what you were trying to do, right?  Anyone is allowed to use it for themselves, I never said no one should do that if that’s what they want. Queer is a slur though. I just want people to be aware of that, I have no idea if OP is aware of that or not but some people using that word aren’t. I’m tired of people including me and other people who don’t want to be included in that word, and before anyone asks, I never meant that OP did that, because I literally have no idea if they do.  Queer is a slur as much as any other LGBT+ word, I just want you to be aware of that.  “Gay” is used as an insult. It is used to be demeaning. Its used to discriminate. And yet its used as the all mighty umbrella - gay rights, gay marriage, gay community - when discussing the entire community.  Gay gets used as a slur. Queer gets used as a slur. But I don’t walk up to gay people and say “your identity is a slur, you know that right” or get pissed when they say “the gay community” when they mean the whole community.  Personal identity and preference in terms, even harmful words that get used as slurs, are not questioned; except for the word Queer.  Queer gets shut down. Queer people get others in their faces saying “your identity is a slur!” Queer people don’t have the freedom to identify in a community, but are forced under other terms against their will due to hypocrisy and double standards.  So if you’re not going to come onto gay people’s posts for the same behavior, maybe critically analyze why exactly you feel the need to be so condescending to Queer people, specifically on posts that ONLY have to do with personal identity. Why you feel the need to insist to Queer people that their identities are slurs, to directly slap away the power of reclaiming a word from them by demanding it remain in the hands of the Straights as a perpetual slur.  I think an important difference between gay and queer is however, that queer started out as a slur used against members of the community and continues to be used as a slur in many places. Whereas gay began as a word the community chose itself to describe itself and was then later used by homophobes and heterosexuals in general in a negative way, meaning however, that gay doesn’t hold the same negative connotations as queer for many people simply because it was our word that they took, and not a word that they forced on us to make us “strange” or “other” like queer means.  That’s…. Not true. People think so because the history before gay was reclaimed is way older (older than any love community member’s lifetimes, probably,) but gay had the exact same origins.  It was meant to denote sexually perverse people, most frequently sex workers and those who hired them. Anyone who participated in anything but married, vanilla, straight sex might have been referred to as “gay,” including any suspected LGBT person.  The word (already being one frequently used on the community,) was reclaimed as a community identifier when the community wanted to disconnect from the clinical and diagnostic implications of “homosexual.”  There is record of queer being reclaimed and used as a personal identifier literally before the popularization of gay. Both words are reclaimed slurs with negative histories, and BOTH are used as slurs against the community still to this day.  The more recent history of the mid to late 20th century more prevalently favored queer as a slur, as is represented in our media. However its clearly undeniable that the switch back to gay as the popular community slur (along with the ever present f slur,) happened in the 2000s. Which is trying to be denied and rewritten by the anti queer crowd, who completely ignore the words popularity with community members who actually lived through when it was a popular slur.  Yes to all of this. When it comes to words for “not straight” there are hardly any choices that didn’t originate as ways to stigmatize or pathologize us. We are all using reclaimed slurs to describe ourselves.  Also, queer is reclaimed in a particularly empowering way. It doesn’t just mean “same-sex attraction” but encompasses a whole spectrum of attractions and gender orientations. It’s a word that says to asexuals, pansexuals, bisexuals, trans folks, genderfluid and genderqueer and genderless folks and people who are still figuring themselves out, “hey, you’ve got a home here. We don’t need to categorize you to love you.”  This is important because there are a lot of divisions within the LGBTQ+ world, and in particular cis gay men and cis lesbians often overlook or exclude trans, bi and asexual people. Queer is the only word that not only demands equal acceptance for everyone, but leaves the door open for words and descriptors that haven’t even been invented yet.  Somebody else pointed this out earlier to me, and of course I’ve lost the post, but it’s really suspicious that of all the reclaimed slurs, the one that gets the most pushback is the one that is most radically accepting of all identities    “hey, you’ve got a home here. We don’t need to categorize you to love you.” Lmao yeah! the pushback against this idea is overt and disgusting and I don’t trust anybody who perpetuates it.  Queer is an ideology and an identity, historically and now. It is an umbrella for that ideology and an umbrella for those identities, historically and now. They can’t be conflated (with LGBT) and it’s super fucking disingenuous to pretend one is just the tarnished besmirched dirty slur version of the other. They’re different. In my particular work for example, Queer bioethics is different from LGBT bioethics and conflating the two will muddle any discussion you try to have about them because they lead to literally opposite conclusions in some cases.   Yeah I freaking love pancakes  Wait wrong post  By far the best addition to this post  This is one of those things where I feel like an old.  Like, *the* slogan I associate with pride is, “We’re here, we’re queer – get used to it!”   There was a TV show   called “Queer Eye for the Straight Guy” that was total mainstream pap.   (Not that the show wasn’t riddles problematic elements from the concept out, but ‘queer’ in the title was clearly meant as a positive.)I just have a hard time processing queer as anything but reclaimed.     They actually shot “Queer As Folk” in my city!  TERFs and radical gender/sexuality bianarists are flooding social media and blogging sites with propaganda smearing the word queer in the hopes of silencing all of us who don’t identify with their hate politics. I fought hard to reclaim the word queer in the late 80s and early 90s, and it’s the one word that doesn’t worship exclusion. Which is why these people are trying to convince you not to use it. fuck that noise. there is literally no word i could use to identify my sexuality that hasn’t been thrown at me in hatred, fear, and violence. No way am I giving up the one of those that allows me to talk about all of my community without trying to put people in boxes they don’t fit in.  I will never not reblog this post. Queer, queer, queer here.   “Queer” has been claimed by queer people as a self-descriptor since at least 1910. It’s an insult to those historical people (and all the generations of queer historical people who have identified as queer since then) to pretend that the people using it as a slur owned it more than the queer people who used it as a self-descriptor. Source: George Chauncey, “Gay New York,” page 101  They don’t want us to use queer because they don’t want to be lumped in with anyone who’s not cis gay or cis lesbian. So fine. You don’t like the word queer? You don’t want to be in the “queer” community? Get the fuck out, then. Y'all don’t welcome us in your community anyway, so we’ll just have our own. And it’ll be queer as fuck.  I fucking love the word queer ❤  Or, to put it another way, using a great old slogan of the community: I’m not gay as in happy, I’m queer as in fuck you.  Yes yes yes yes yes! These younglings today don’t know their queer history but feel so free to comment on it. Trying so desperately to assimilate into straight culture by turning your nose up at queer, and all the people who take refuge under its umbrella. Queer accepted me when nobody else would, not even the LGBT groups.  Queer is full of the types of people who don’t make good poster children for the middle class assimilationist cis gay couple just looking to get married and have some kids. Queer forces us to realize the fight didn’t end with gay marriage, and cis gays are gonna have to step out of the spotlight sometimes, and realize cis gays have privilege, and fight for someone with less. Trans people, nonbinary people, people in nontraditional relationship structures, aromantics, asexuals, sex workers. Heck more and more bisexual people these days are switching over to queer because the amount of biphobia in the so-called lgBt community is so alienating, and also because so many of us feel the term bisexual reinforces a false gender dichotomy and we’re too tired of jokes about kitchenware to use pansexual. Part of what I love about the term queer is that it does make people uncomfortable. It makes them aware of their privilege, exposes certain biases, even within the LGBT community. What’s so wrong with a movement that strives to fight for everybody, huh? Huh?  Proudly bi, proudly queer, and being part of this movement when I was young was an honor.

The thing is that Bill Nye shouldn’t have any credibility outside his field of engineering. He’s not a biologist, he’s not an astronomer, he’s just received a Bachelors in engineering. He has received honorary Doctorates, but some people receive hundreds of these and they really amount to micro-recognitions on a campus-by-campus basis.  If you want to actually learn about the frontier of this stuff, hit the library. A scholarly database through a university is even better.  But the mere sound of this one television personality honorary doctor with a BA in engineering taught me about biology should be plenty enough for folks to realize the problems here. But they won’t because he’s a childhood element and he says stuff that they want to here and that is more powerful than the desire to actually be as informed as possible.  Do you understand that he’s probably spent his entire career furthering his education and that a degree doesn’t really keep someone from being qualified to speak? Especially as a professional communicator, he probably has hundreds of people that he consults for stuff that he might not be an expert in? And that he’s motivated to educate himself on everything he says BECAUSE he’s a media representative for scientists and if he says something wrong he has literally millions of scientists who will correct or critique him?  Like did you know that pretty much everything he talks about is covered in the intro courses of whatever he is talking about? And that anytime he needs to go more in depth he usually leaves that to the actual experts? And that his job is to being an introductory concept to the masses to make them more scientifically literate and educated? His job is to get people interested in whatever topic he’s talking about so that they can actually go and do their own research and ask actual experts?  THIS. As a science teacher whose job often involves trying to explain complicated concepts like climate change, human evolution, and dinosaur phylogeny to kids as young as 6, I can attest with some authority that the ability to take a complex scientific concept and distill it down so that it’s a) accessible to young audiences/laypeople, b) still accurate, and c) engaging as hell – that is a SKILL. And one that does not necessarily come as part of a PhD.  if you dont understand why i listen to the friendly man who specialises in accessible mass teaching, then i fully expect you to finance for me the 15 years of university youre demanding i do instead.  Also it is a little bit hilarious that OP focuses so much biology, which suggest they are referring to the newest bit of Bill Nye being affirmative about sex/gender not being the binary that is taught in high school sex ed - which is actually the scientific reality of biology, if you’re looking at the hundreds if not thousands of intersex variations in humans (hormonal, chromosomal, physical, etc)… like an actual biologist doesn’t have a leg to stand on arguing “sex is binary.” But the minute a tv personality says science is against your bigoted worldview, out come the “he only has a BA, this man knows nothing, stop liking him.” LOL  Science writers often do not have advanced degrees when they are writing for publications. Teachers often don’t have advanced degrees when they break down concepts for kids. Have you ever read a scientific journal? Dry as hell and out of most people’s spheres of knowledge. You are talking about everyone doing the equivalent of advanced coursework on every issue. I’m too busy being an expert in my field to be an expert in everyone else’s fields. That’s why I rely on smart people to educate me. There is something wrong with my car. I am going to take it to a car expert at a shop. There are things wrong with the world. I am going to get educated at my level from people who know what the hell they are talking about, even if one is a science advocate and tv personality with scientists in his wheelhouse.  This commentary is beautiful. 10/10 Being able to understand something very complex by reading academic papers about it is one skill set. Helping a bunch of other people with diverse learning styles and abilities understand something very complex? TOTALLY different skill set. Generating interest in a topic because you’re passionate about it? Again, another skill set. " False text

There’s the psychoanalytical dimension (Jung: “""Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes""), and the spiritual dimension (Tibetan Buddhism: “enlightenment is awakening to the illusory, empty, and dreamlike nature of experience”), which are both the domains of Cooper’s “dreamwalking.” But there’s also the sociological/cultural dimension, articulated by the language of black American activists (”stay woke”). The American Dream, made possible by white supremacy and settler colonialism, and exemplified by the idealized, white middle class existence of Twin Peaks, is equally a part of this Lynchian dreamworld. Albert is generally cast as the odd scientific-rational duck at the Philadelphia office for not being “wired in” to Cooper/Gordon/Chet’s dream reality/modi operandi, but that’s not due to any lack of perceptiveness on Albert’s part. It’s that his ability to penetrate the Dream is on a different track than Cooper’s. Albert is highly perceptive and responsive to specific dreamscapes, namely, these American Dream-scapes that would mask the horrific reality of abuse, sex trafficking, drug trafficking, unchecked and environmentally destructive industry, colonialism, and racism that support this Dream-scape that killed Laura Palmer. And just as Albert is often out-of-sync with Cooper’s dream reality, Cooper is very, very out of sync with Albert’s dream reality, as evidenced by his disastrous faith in the purity and “goodness” of a town that is very clearly rotten to the core.

He was then educated in Córdoba, the heart of Islamic  Spain, and subsequently traveled extensively through North Africa, Asia  Minor, and Europe—including trips through Christian Spain, France, and  England.

The problem is that this kind of writing is predicated on the assumption that only European people and cultures have a history worth mentioning, and that anything noteworthy happening elsewhere is some kind of reversal of a natural order in which Europe is both first and central to any comparison.  Notice that this is touched on in the first paragraph of the article, without actually naming what the assumptions consist of:  Archaeologists in Cambodia  have found multiple, previously undocumented medieval cities not far  from the ancient temple city of Angkor Wat, the Guardian can reveal, in  groundbreaking discoveries that promise to upend key assumptions about  south-east Asia’s history. The Australian archaeologist Dr Damian Evans, whose findings will be published in the Journal of Archaeological Science  on Monday, will announce that cutting-edge airborne laser scanning  technology has revealed multiple cities between 900 and 1,400 years old  beneath the tropical forest floor, some of which rival the size of  Cambodia’s capital, Phnom Penh.  And because these assumptions have raged unchecked for centuries, you have what was apparently the largest empire in the 12th century lying undiscovered in Cambodia for hundreds of years because “no one” expected it to be there.  It might seem like a petty gripe, but consider the sheer size and scope of it: Try and imagine that no one knew Ancient Rome existed until like, a year ago.  I found this particular sentence from another article about this “discovery” interesting: In 2012, scientists confirmed the alleged existence of another temple city near Angkor Wat.  Alleged by whom? My guess is probably the people who live in the area and knew it was there all along, but it doesn’t “count” until it’s been accounted for by Australian, French, American, and British academics, who are the only ones I could find quoted on this excavation in various articles.
