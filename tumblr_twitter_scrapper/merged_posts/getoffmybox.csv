Speaking as someone who works in the concrete forming industry: the easiest way to severely fuck up any large concrete pour is to delay it at the wrong moment. If someone is trying to build a huge fuckoff concrete thing - say, for instance, a giant wall - they‚Äôre going to need an obscene quantity of concrete, and that‚Äôs all going to have to be transported there from the nearest mixing plant. This means they‚Äôll have multiple trucks coming by to decant concrete in consecutive pours while the workers place it and vibrate it to ensure it all intermixes and sets properly, forming a monolithic mass. If one pour is allowed to set before the next one is added, you get a big, ugly, possibly structurally unsound gap between the two called a ‚Äúcold joint.‚Äù A bad enough cold joint can completely fuck your whole project because the next engineer or inspector who sets foot on that site is going to take one look at that motherfucker and immediately embark on a quest for blood vengeance. You will literally have to cut that whole section of wall out, slap some dowels in the nearest structurally sound bits, and re-form and pour the offending segment from scratch, which represents a fortune in cost overruns and will make everyone involved very upset. This is an especially bad problem in hot climates, because the concrete curing process is exothermic - that stuff sets much faster when it‚Äôs really hot out, and its 28-day compressive strength tends to be poorer as well. So if, hypothetically speaking, you wanted to completely shit up a wannabe dictator‚Äôs enormous unfeasible poured concrete vanity project, you could literally just randomly hassle and delay every concrete truck on its way there. Dude‚Äôs gonna end up with a giant worthless pile of shitty crumbling concrete and exposed reinforcing steel, and an army of pissed-off contractors to boot.  reblogging for purely educational purposes nothing more " False text

However, that‚Äôs just a few workers‚Äô perception of the industry, right? I mean, I have researched a bit online and found an entire data-base of journal articles that study the (mainly negative) affects of porn, watched a PBS doc that is particularly damning and had (up until I read this thread) made the conclusion: porn is just bad. But I don‚Äôt think sex workers are to be stigmatized, though (obviously).  Women are chewed up and spit out the porn industry. It‚Äôs rough. We are aware of this and I was also made aware b/c of the thread, that women do want to do this work. Also, what counts EVEN MORE is there is a DEMAND for this work (which, we never speak of, either).  Is there a way for the porn industry to be overhauled? I want sex workers who do porn (and all sex workers) to be safe, paid, and respected. I don‚Äôt think this is asking anymore than what ANY OTHER BUSINESS does for its employees.  Is this possible? I don‚Äôt participate in anything the porn industry is, I believe it is too exploitative and dehumanizing to women. I also don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs my place to prevent women from being sex workers if they are choosing to do so (as many of the women on that FB thread emphasized) if that‚Äôs what they do. There‚Äôs a demand. Maybe that‚Äôs MORE of the problem? Plus, child sex trafficking is a HUGE problem in the US‚Ä¶how much of this is DUE TO the porn industry?  What are others‚Äô thoughts on this?

The goal of Walk Against Rape is to empower survivors, their friends, families and supporters, to break that silence by walking together on the streets against rape, and declare that we will not tolerate sexual violence. If you could spare even just a few dollars to help me real my goal, I‚Äôd sincerely appreciate it. And so would the numerous individuals who benefit from the services SFWAR so graciously provides.

First, is ‚ÄúThe Handmaid‚Äôs Tale‚Äù a ‚Äúfeminist‚Äù novel? If you mean an ideological tract in which all women are angels and/or so victimized they are incapable of moral choice, no. If you mean a novel in which women are human beings - with all the variety of character and behavior that implies - and are also interesting and important, and what happens to them is crucial to the theme, structure and plot of the book, then yes. In that sense, many books are ‚Äúfeminist.‚Äù Why interesting and important? Because women are interesting and important in real life. They are not an afterthought of nature, they are not secondary players in human destiny, and every society has always known that. Without women capable of giving birth, human populations would die out. That is why the mass rape and murder of women, girls and children has long been a feature of genocidal wars, and of other campaigns meant to subdue and exploit a population. Kill their babies and replace their babies with yours, as cats do; make women have babies they can‚Äôt afford to raise, or babies you will then remove from them for your own purposes, steal babies - it‚Äôs been a widespread, age-old motif. The control of women and babies has been a feature of every repressive regime on the planet. Napoleon and his ‚Äúcannon fodder,‚Äù slavery and its ever-renewed human merchandise ‚Äî they both fit in here. Of those promoting enforced childbirth, it should be asked: Cui bono? Who profits by it? Sometimes this sector, sometimes that. Never no one.‚Äù Read the full essay by Margaret Atwood¬†here   The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale by Margaret Atwood    {always reblog}" False link

After completing it, Mary went to the hospital, where she was informed that she was in labor. She gave birth to a daughter, whose picture appears in the post. (She‚Äôs wearing a ‚ÄúLittle Miss Lyft‚Äù onesie.) The post concludes with a call for similar stories: ‚ÄúDo you have an exciting Lyft story you‚Äôd love to share? Tweet us your story at @lyft_CHI!‚ÄùMary‚Äôs story looks different to different people. Within the ghoulishly cheerful Lyft public-relations machinery, Mary is an exemplar of hard work and dedication‚Äîthe latter being, perhaps, hard to come by in a company that refuses to classify its drivers as employees. Mary‚Äôs entrepreneurial spirit‚Äîtaking ride requests while she was in labor!‚Äîis an ‚Äúexciting‚Äù example of how seamless and flexible app-based employment can be. Look at that hustle! You can make a quick buck with Lyft anytime, even when your cervix is dilating.Lyft does not provide its drivers paid maternity leave or health insurance. (It offers to connect drivers with an insurance broker, and helpfully notes that ‚Äúthe Affordable Care Act offers many choices to make sure you‚Äôre covered.‚Äù) A third-party platform called SherpaShare, which some drivers use to track their earnings, found, in 2015, that Lyft drivers in Chicago net about eleven dollars per trip. Perhaps, as Lyft suggests, Mary kept accepting riders while experiencing contractions because ‚Äúshe was still a week away from her due date,‚Äù or ‚Äúshe didn‚Äôt believe she was going into labor yet.‚Äù Or maybe Mary kept accepting riders because the gig economy has further normalized the circumstances in which earning an extra eleven dollars can feel more important than seeking out the urgent medical care that these quasi-employers do not sponsor.¬†In the other version of Mary‚Äôs story, she‚Äôs an unprotected worker in precarious circumstances. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt pretend to know Mary‚Äôs economic situation,‚Äù wrote Bryan Menegus at Gizmodo, when the story first appeared. ‚ÄúMaybe she‚Äôs an heiress who happens to love the freedom of chauffeuring strangers from place to place on her own schedule. But that Lyft, for some reason, thought that this would reflect kindly on them is perhaps the most horrifying part.‚Äù(Continue Reading) Yeah, no. Lyft. No. You don‚Äôt come off looking good in this situation.At all." False link
