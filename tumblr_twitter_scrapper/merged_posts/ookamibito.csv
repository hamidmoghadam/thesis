This guy literally inherited millions of dollars of property, but considered himself a self-made man because he also worked a job that was practically a hobby, completely unnecessary for him. He also complained that “our generation is so entitled” - because all of his stinking rich friends just got cushy jobs at their parents’ companies. He seriously had no fucking idea that this was a thing exclusive to the rich. So yeah, I definitely think this is 100% true. Explains the bizarre counterclaims, too, where some millenial acts like all Boomers are wealthy power brokers and no poor Boomers could possibly exist - again, it’s the filthy rich complaining about their own parents. The reason all their millenials vs boomers bullshit is so fucking out of touch with reality is that it’s all rooted in the capitalist class bickering about each other from their own incredibly insular, clueless perspective.

Okay no, you can’t just drop a knowledge bomb like that and not EXPLAIN! Or at least link! Gimme a search term?! Anything! ok i’ll write up the lightning-bolt of bizarre mental synthesis later but here: the pacific standard article and the pdf of the study in question find the term “folkbiological reasoning” and peruse this paragraph in the psmag article: “Studies show that Western urban children grow up so closed off in man-made environments that their brains never form a deep or complex connection to the natural world. While studying children from the U.S., researchers have suggested a developmental timeline for what is called “folkbiological reasoning.” These studies posit that it is not until children are around 7 years old that they stop projecting human qualities onto animals and begin to understand that humans are one animal among many. Compared to Yucatec Maya communities in Mexico, however, Western urban children appear to be developmentally delayed in this regard. Children who grow up constantly interacting with the natural world are much less likely to anthropomorphize other living things into late childhood.” now consider, and i say this in the least pejorative way possible, that furry culture seems to arise at least partially from a desire/instinct to anthropomorphize and identify with non-human animals, often in broad, non-species-specific categories (cat, dog, etc.).  i need to lie down  As an outsider to furry culture the whole thing is really interesting.  I approach animals from a certain point of view (veterinary medicine) and I think I understand them, what they are and what they do pretty well. I assumed somebody who goes around introducing themselves as a cat, for example, actually knows something about cats.  Not in this case.  So one evening my brother brought a few of his friends around to my home with fursonas consisting of a dog, cat and kangaroo.  I was bottle raising a litter of seven adorable kittens at the time (a handful and a half, let me tell you) and I thought this was brilliant. Three animal lovers, in my home, which don’t have any pets of their own. Perfect future kitten owners, right? I mean, at a certain stage in kitten season you start trying to pimp out those cute little fuzzballs to anybody.  Mr Cat Fursona had no idea what to do with a real live cat or kitten. He’d never interacted with one, he’d only seen pictures and videos. He was so thoroughly awkward, and possibly a little bit afraid, completely unsure about how to hold them, what to do if they wiggled and even if they were happy. He marveled at the way their ears twitch when they swallow but freaked out about their toileting habits. And to my surprise he wasn’t actually interested in these real cats for more than three minutes.  They had minimal interest in this litter of kittens, they were not interested in real animals. They were not familiar with real animals.  I don’t think they’re ascribing human characteristics to an animal. This group seemed to be taking perceived animal qualities (eg dog=loyalty, cat=aloof) and applying it to themselves. Even if the real animals don’t actually have those qualities at all, they were interested in the qualities that society had assigned those animals and then applying that to themselves. Is was society’s concept of a cat that was of interest to him, not the real thing.  So you can be a cat, it seems, without knowing a single thing about cats. And perhaps if he had grown up with cats then he wouldn’t have chosen one for his fursona.   Fascinating! I grew up in the woods, in farm country, very close to nature and animals. I wonder if that’s why I’m not a furry? *shrug*  id like to thank god, jesus, and those bullshit lake camps my parents sent me to when I was ten  here’s the post I was referring to.  This post is a bit irritating to me. Whether on purpose or not, this is a bit insulting and pretty blatantly untrue. I’m literally a year away from my BA in Biology and Animal Science, and I know several other furries that are studying veterinary and wildlife medicine, or are into taxidermy, or at the very least, love to go camping. Not to mention, it would probably be more of an anomaly if I knew a furry that didn’t have a pet than one that did. Tumblr has this weird thing where they like to speculate on the furry subculture but never dare to actually contact a single one. Like, if you want to know why a furry is a furry so bad, just ask. It’s not an enigma.  Some reasons people are furries, just off the top of my head, include:  dyscalculia and difficulty recognizing faces, but fursonas are colorful and unique and a lot easier to recognize;  intense bullying and unstable homes and furry was a support network;  was just a bookish kid that loved redwall/other fantasies;  mental/physical disability and furry was, again, a support network;  or a VERY big and VERY OFTEN overlooked factor: LGBT looking for other LGBT. Literally almost 75 percent of furries are some flavor of LGBT. The furry subculture, like any subculture, cannot be pinned down to one definitive reason why it exists, but it follows a pattern of attracting people that are in any way marginalized: LGBT, mental or physical disorders (i know of several Deaf, autistic/asperger’s, and crippled furries, and I personally have anxiety), or just generally meek, shy, nerdy, artsy, or ‘weird’ kids.  I loved dragons for as long as I can remember. I was also intensely bullied, and the idea of covetous, protective dragons keeping me safe from people pulling my hair or kicking my desk was just reinforced from that. Then I found that ‘furry’ thing and I found my partner and we both had the same mental escapes and bullying problems when we were in grade school. Now we’ve known each other for almost a decade. Whoops. People with no experience to the subculture tend to be really, really repulsed by it and I still don’t know why. I guess it’s because it looks intensely childish and naive and cringey, and that can be true with some furries, especially. I’m not denying that. But the weird outright hostility and patronization is something I can’t tolerate, especially when such a large percentage of furries are marginalized in some way or another. Like, a lack of exposure to the outdoors? Come on, dude.  Reblogging for the last bit. " False text

We have entered a phase of regression,and one of the easiest ways to see it is in our infrastructure: our roads and bridges look more like those in Thailand or Venezuela than the Netherlands or Japan. But it goes far deeper than that, which is why Temin uses a famous economic model created to understand developing nations to describe how far inequality has progressed in the United States. The model is the work of West Indian economist W. Arthur Lewis, the only person of African descent to win a Nobel Prize in economics.  In the Lewis model of a dual economy, much of the low-wage sector has little influence over public policy. Check.  The high-income sector will keep wages down in the other sector to provide cheap labor for its businesses. Check.  Social control is used to keep the low-wage sector from challenging the policies favored by the high-income sector. Mass incarceration - check.  The primary goal of the richest members of the high-income sector is to lower taxes. Check.  Social and economic mobility is low. Check. Temin says that today in the U.S., the ticket out is education, which is difficult for two reasons: you have to spend money over a long period of time, and the FTE sector is making those expenditures more and more costly by defunding public schools and making policies that increase student debt burdens.   Even with a diploma, you will likely find that high-paying jobs come from networks of peers and relatives. Social capital, as well as economic capital, is critical, but because of America’s long history of racism and the obstacles it has created for accumulating both kinds of capital, black graduates often can only find jobs in education, social work, and government instead of higher-paying professional jobs like technology or finance— something most white people are not really aware of. Women are also held back by a long history of sexism and the burdens — made increasingly heavy — of making greater contributions to the unpaid care economy and lack of access to crucial healthcare. How did we get this way? What happened to America’s middle class, which rose triumphantly in the post-World War II years, buoyed by the GI bill, the victories of labor unions, and programs that gave the great mass of workers and their families health and pension benefits that provided security? Around 1970, the productivity of workers began to get divided from their wages. Corporate attorney and later Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell galvanized the business community to lobby vigorously for its interests. Johnson’s War on Poverty was replaced by Nixon’s War on Drugs, which sectioned off many members of the low-wage sector, disproportionately black, into prisons. Politicians increasingly influenced by the FTE sector turned from public-spirited universalism to free-market individualism. As money-driven politics accelerated (a phenomenon explained by the Investment Theory of Politics, as Temin explains), leaders of the FTE sector became increasingly emboldened to ignore the needs of members of the low-wage sector, or even to actively work against them.  Temin notes that “the desire to preserve the inferior status of blacks has motivated policies against all members of the low-wage sector.” What can we do? We’ve been digging ourselves into a hole for over forty years, but Temin says that we know how to stop digging.  If we spent more on domestic rather than military activities, then the middle class would not vanish as quickly.  The effects of technological change and globalization could be altered by political actions.  We could restore and expand education, shifting resources from policies like mass incarceration to improving the human and social capital of all Americans.  We could upgrade infrastructure, forgive mortgage and educational debt in the low-wage sector,  reject the notion that private entities should replace democratic government in directing society, and  focus on embracing an integrated American population.  We could tax not only the income of the rich, but also their capital.   We have a structure that predetermines winners and losers. We are not getting the benefits of all the people who could contribute to the growth of the economy, to advances in medicine or science which could improve the quality of life for everyone — including some of the rich people.” Along with Thomas Piketty, whose Capital in the Twenty-First Century examines historical and modern inequality, Temin’s book has provided a giant red flag, illustrating a trajectory that will continue to accelerate as long as the 20 percent in the FTE sector are permitted to operate a country within America’s borders solely for themselves at the expense of the majority.  Without a robust middle class, America is not only reverting to developing-country status, it is increasingly ripe for serious social turmoil that has not been seen in generations.

The U.S. media, however, never provide this context and instead they present North Korean military propaganda as being unhinged and aggressive. They never compare this, of course, to U.S. military flyovers at sporting events or the ceremonial induction of new soldiers at halftime, or even to our National Anthem with its celebration of bombings and rockets and warfare. If North Korea is “crazy” for its militarism, then the United States is downright certifiable.  U.S. propaganda can dismiss North Korea’s legitimate concerns so easily because of the underlying racist assumption that these are a bizarre and simple-minded people that believe in things like unicorns. This feeds off of and into orientalist logic that sees East Asians as a nearly subhuman “other” that can’t be reasoned with and so must be handled with force. It worked when we needed to justify violence against immigrant laborers in the 19th century and it works to justify our imperialist expansion today." False link

Western propaganda draws from a deep well of racist “yellow peril” prejudice to stoke irrational fears against this tiny, poor, isolated country, and it amplifies this paranoia with long-standing stereotypes of East Asian “oddity” to dehumanize North Koreans and justify U.S. aggression against them.  The U.S. media, however, never provide this context and instead they present North Korean military propaganda as being unhinged and aggressive. They never compare this, of course, to U.S. military flyovers at sporting events or the ceremonial induction of new soldiers at halftime, or even to our National Anthem with its celebration of bombings and rockets and warfare. If North Korea is “crazy” for its militarism, then the United States is downright certifiable.  U.S. propaganda can dismiss North Korea’s legitimate concerns so easily because of the underlying racist assumption that these are a bizarre and simple-minded people that believe in things like unicorns. This feeds off of and into orientalist logic that sees East Asians as a nearly subhuman “other” that can’t be reasoned with and so must be handled with force. It worked when we needed to justify violence against immigrant laborers in the 19th century and it works to justify our imperialist expansion today." False link

Long story short: the world-famous university of iowa creative writing program was established as a CIA front whose sole purpose was to create a literary movement that was supportive of capitalism. it was part of a greater feat of social engineering called Operation Mockingbird, wherein the CIA would either invent programs like Iowa creative writing, take over existing ones like Washington Post or CBS news, or create literary journals and magazines devoted to state capitalist propaganda.  A good quote from the long article to sort of summarize the ideology engineered by these MFAs: One can easily trace the genealogy from the critical writings of Trilling and Ransom at the beginning of the Cold War to creative-writing handbooks and methods then and since. The discipline of creative writing was effectively born in the 1950s. Imperial prosperity gave rise to it, postwar anxieties shaped it. “Science,” Ransom argued in The World’s Body, “gratifies a rational or practical impulse and exhibits the minimum of perception. Art gratifies a perceptual impulse and exhibits the minimum of reason.” In The Liberal Imagination, Trilling celebrated Hemingway and Faulkner for being “intensely at work upon the recalcitrant stuff of life.” Life was recalcitrant because it resisted our best efforts to reduce it to intellectual abstractions, to ideas, to ideologies.  Basically it was a Walt Whitman-esque, Ameri-typical shift towards the individual story about FEELING and the real experience over the intellectual, the political, the reflective, or the critical, contextualized through liberal supposedly anti-fascist/anti-bureaucratic reactions to WWII and the USSR.  Funded by the CIA, Rockefeller Foundation, etc.; not only took over popular rhetoric about how to write American fiction, but also specifically targeted foreign nationals to come write for the program and propagate this “imaginative, creative” America.  Hallmark styles sanctioned by (though not created by) this approach include modernism, lite literary fiction, and magical realism (though, I’d argue, not exactly the Márquezian variety, definitely the more watered down modern versions).  An example the author was taught is a pyramid diagram with “Meaning, Sense, Clarity” at the bottom and thus the most principal; then “Senses,” then “Character,” then the ‘fancy stuff’: metaphor, symbolism, allegory, i.e. the theoretical and critical.  " False link

I’ve been working on these premises about these different social demons, these innately human monsters that are woven into the fabric of how we think and how we interact, and each one of my movies is going to be about a different one of these social demons.” Peele’s examination of race and alienation in “Get Out” is an impressive, confident directorial debut.

According to local news reports, centers in New York, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Texas and Alabama were targeted.  “It appears to be the same serial caller” as in the prior incidents, Goldenberg told JTA. Goldenberg said that some of the JCCs were evacuated and others were not. “The JCCs are very well-equipped to handle this,” he said. Goldenberg did not confirm where any of the threats occurred, saying they took place across the country and that his office “is monitoring the situation.” Goldenberg said the fact that the threats were made on Presidents Day, when more people might be in the buildings during the daytime, does not appear to be a factor in the threats. Last week, President Donald Trump was asked during a news conference about the prior JCC bomb threats and what the government’s response would be to “an uptick in anti-Semitism.” Although the reporter did not suggest Trump was anti-Semitic, the president answered by denying he is an anti-Semite and called the question “insulting.” The Harry & Rose Samson Family Jewish Community Center in Whitefish Bay, Milwaukee was evacuated Monday morning after receiving  threatening phone calls, the Journal Sentinel reported. Two Jewish Community Centers in Buffalo, New York were also evacuated Monday morning following bomb threats, the Buffalo News reported. The St. Paul Jewish Community Center in Minnesota was evacuated Monday morning after a bomb threat, the Star Tribune reported citing local police. the Evelyn Rubenstein Jewish Community Center in Houston, Texas was also evacuated following a bomb threat received by phone, a local NBC affiliate reported.

As Speaker John Boehner has said, the poor have a notion that “I really don’t have to work. I don’t really want to do this. I think I’d rather just sit around.” In  reality, a large and growing share of the nation’s poor work full time  – sometimes sixty or more hours a week – yet still don’t earn enough  to lift themselves and their families out of poverty.   It’s also commonly believed, especially among Republicans, that the rich deserve their wealth because they work harder than others.  In reality, a large and growing portion of the super-rich have never broken a sweat. Their wealth has been handed to them.  The  rise of these two groups – the working poor and non-working rich – is  relatively new. Both are challenging the core American assumptions that  people are paid what they’re worth, and work is justly rewarded. Why are these two groups growing? The ranks of the working poor are growing because wages at the bottom have dropped,  adjusted for inflation. With increasing numbers of Americans taking  low-paying jobs in retail sales, restaurants, hotels, hospitals,  childcare, elder care, and other personal services, the pay of the  bottom fifth is falling closer to the minimum wage. At the same time, the real value of the federal minimum wage is lower today than it was a quarter century ago.  In addition, most recipients of public assistance must now work in order to qualify.  Bill  Clinton’s welfare reform of 1996 pushed the poor off welfare and into  work. Meanwhile, the Earned Income Tax Credit, a wage subsidy, has  emerged as the nation’s largest anti-poverty program. Here, too, having a  job is a prerequisite.  The new work requirements haven’t reduced  the number or percentage of Americans in poverty. They’ve just moved  poor people from being unemployed and impoverished to being employed and  impoverished. A very clever scheme by Republicans. While poverty declined in the early years of  welfare reform when the economy boomed and jobs were plentiful, it began  growing in 2000. By 2012 it exceeded its level in 1996, when welfare ended. At  the same time, the ranks of the non-working rich have been swelling.  America’s legendary “self-made” men and women are fast being replaced by  wealthy heirs.  Six of today’s ten wealthiest Americans are heirs  to prominent fortunes. The Walmart heirs alone have more wealth than  the bottom 40 percent of Americans combined. Americans  who became enormously wealthy over the last three decades are now  busily transferring that wealth to their children and grand children. The nation is on the cusp of the largest inter-generational transfer of wealth in history. A study  from the Boston College Center on Wealth and Philanthropy projects a  total of $59 trillion passed down to heirs between 2007 and 2061. As  the French economist Thomas Piketty reminds us, this is the kind of  dynastic wealth that’s kept Europe’s aristocracy going for centuries.  It’s about to become the major source of income for a new American  aristocracy. This is what the Koch/Walton Republicans have schemed for; the Gilded Age. The tax code encourages all this by favoring unearned income over earned income.  The  top tax rate paid by America’s wealthy on their capital gains – the  major source of income for the non-working rich – has dropped from 33  percent in the late 1980s to 20 percent today, putting it substantially  below the top tax rate on ordinary income (36.9 percent). If the owners of capital assets whose worth increases over their lifetime hold them until death, their heirs pay zero capital gains taxes on them. Such “unrealized” gains now account for more than half the value of assets held by estates worth more than $100 million. At  the same time, the estate tax has been slashed. Before George W. Bush  was president, it applied to assets in excess of $2 million per couple  at a rate of 55 percent. Now it kicks in at $10,680,000 per couple, at a  40 percent rate. Last year only 1.4 out of every 1,000 estates owed any estate tax, and the effective rate they paid was only 17 percent. Republicans  now in control of Congress want to go even further. Last Friday the  Senate voted 54-46 in favor of a non-binding resolution to repeal the  estate tax altogether. Earlier in the week, the House Ways and Means  Committee also voted for a repeal. The House is expected to vote in  coming weeks. Yet the specter of an entire generation doing  nothing for their money other than speed-dialing their wealth management  advisers is not particularly attractive. It puts more and more  responsibility for investing a substantial portion of the nation’s  assets into the hands of people who have never worked. It also endangers our democracy, as dynastic wealth inevitably and invariably accumulates political influence and power. Consider  the rise of both the working poor and the non-working rich, and the  meritocratic ideal on which America’s growing inequality is often  justified doesn’t hold up. That widening inequality – combined  with the increasing numbers of people who work full time but are still  impoverished and of others who have never worked and are fabulously  wealthy – is undermining the moral foundations of American capitalism.  Just pointing out real quick that the moral foundation of American capitalism is enslaving human beings.  The actual info here is on point though. Organize! " False link

What Foster Wallace saw in a Federer Moment, I see in a video of neo-Nazi Richard Spencer getting punched in the face. You may have seen it, it’s a meme now, set to backing tracks of Bruce Springsteen, New Order, even a song from Hamilton. The punch, landed by a masked protester on Inauguration Day, lends itself perfectly to a beat. Spencer, who states that America belongs to white men, was in the midst of telling an Australian TV crew in D.C. that he was not a neo-Nazi, while pointing to his neo-Nazi Pepe the Frog lapel pin. A black-clad figure then jumps into frame, deus ex machina, with a perfectly placed right hook to Spencer’s face. The Alt-Right poster boy stumbles away, and his anonymous attacker bounds out of sight in an instant. I don’t know who threw the punch, but I know by his unofficial uniform that this was a member of our black bloc that day. And anyone enjoying the Nazi-bashing clip (and many are) should know that they’re watching anti-fascist bloc tactics par excellence—pure kinetic beauty. If you want to thank Spencer’s puncher, thank the black bloc. […]   “The black bloc I joined met at Logan Circle, some two miles north of the inauguration parade route. We peered through bandanas to find friends. We gathered in bloc formation behind wood-enforced banners, we filled the street and began to march. The bloc takes care to stay together, move together and blend together. Within minutes, bottle rockets were shooting skyward and bricks were flying through bank windows. You don’t know who does what in a bloc, you don’t look to find out. If bodies run out of formation to take a rock to a Starbucks window, they melt back to the bloc in as many seconds. Bodies reconciled, kinetic beauty. If that sounds to you like a precondition for mob violence, you’re right. But this is only a problem if you think there are no righteous mobs, or that windows feel pain, or that counter-violence (like punching Richard Spencer) is never valid.”  “To talk with any romance for the black bloc risks falling into the worst tropes of bombastic revolutionary writing. We don’t don black masks and become instant revolutionary subjects. We don’t necessarily achieve more with property damage than a larger, more subdued rally achieves. In every case, the standard of achievement depends on the aims of the action, and all of us are far from creating the rupture we want to see in the world. One broken window, or a hundred, is not victory. But nor is over half a million people rallying on the National Mall. Both gain potency only if they are perceived as a threat by those in and around power. And neither action will appear threatening unless followed up again and again with unrelenting force, in a multitude of directions. You don’t have to choose between pink hat and black mask; each of us can wear both. You don’t have to fight neo-Nazis in the street, but you should support those who do.”" False link
