How a neural network basically works is it looks at¬†a set of data - in this case, a long list of Sherwin-Williams paint color names and RGB (red, green, blue) numbers that represent the color - and it tries to form its own rules about how to generate more data like it.¬† Last time I reported results that were, well‚Ä¶ mixed. The neural network produced colors, all right, but it hadn‚Äôt gotten the hang of producing appealing names to go with them - instead producing names like Rose Hork, Stanky Bean, and Turdly. It also had trouble matching names to colors, and would often produce an ‚ÄúIce Gray‚Äù that was a mustard yellow, for example, or a ‚ÄúFerry Purple‚Äù that was decidedly brown. ¬† These were not great names. There are lots of things that affect how well the algorithm does, however. One simple change turns out to be the¬†‚Äútemperature‚Äù (think: creativity) variable, which adjusts whether the neural network always picks the most likely next character as it‚Äôs generating text, or whether it will go with something farther down the list. I had the temperature originally set pretty high, but it turns out that when I turn it down ever so slightly, the algorithm does a lot better. Not only do the names better match the colors, but it begins to reproduce color gradients that must have been in the original dataset all along. Colors tend to be grouped together in these gradients, so it shifts gradually from greens to browns to blues to yellows, etc. and does eventually cover the rainbow, not just beige. Apparently it was trying to give me better results, but I kept screwing it up. Raw output from RGB neural net, now less-annoyed by my temperature setting People also sent in suggestions on how to improve the algorithm. One of the most-frequent was to try a different way of representing color - it turns out that RGB (with a single color represented by the amount of Red, Green, and Blue in it) isn‚Äôt very well matched to the way human eyes perceive color. These are some results from a different color representation, known as HSV. In HSV representation, a single color is represented by three numbers like in RGB, but this time they stand for Hue, Saturation, and Value. You can think of the Hue number as representing the color, Saturation as representing how intense (vs gray) the color is, and Value as representing the brightness. Other than the way of representing the color, everything else about the dataset and the neural network are the same. (char-rnn, 512 neurons and 2 layers, dropout 0.8, 50 epochs) Raw output from HSV neural net: And here are some results from a third color representation, known as LAB. In this color space, the first number stands for lightness, the second number stands for the amount of green vs red, and the third number stands for the the amount of blue vs yellow. Raw output from LAB neural net: It turns out that the color representation doesn‚Äôt make a very big difference in how good the results are (at least as far as I can tell with my very simple experiment). RGB seems to be surprisingly the best able to reproduce the gradients from the original dataset - maybe it‚Äôs more resistant to disruption when the temperature setting introduces randomness. And the color names are pretty bad, no matter how the colors themselves are represented. However, a blog reader compiled¬†this dataset, which has paint colors from other companies such as Behr and Benjamin Moore, as well as a bunch of user-submitted colors from a big XKCD survey. He also changed all the names to lowercase, so the neural network wouldn‚Äôt have to learn two versions of each letter. And the results were‚Ä¶ surprisingly good. Pretty much every name was a plausible match to its color (even if it wasn‚Äôt a plausible color you‚Äôd find in the paint store). The answer seems to be, as it often is for neural networks: more data. Raw output using The Big RGB Dataset: I leave you with the Hall of Fame: RGB: HSV: LAB: Big RGB dataset:  tag urself i‚Äôm sandbork" False text

Come with me! James Comey was (until today) the Director of the FBI. A Republican appointed by Barack Obama in 2013. He made a lot of enemies in the Democratic Party when, 11 days before the 2016 election, he re-opened investigation into Hillary‚Äôs emails. Turned out nothing interesting was in those new emails, and also that this probably did result in Hillary losing the election. Kinda uncool. Also turns out, he did not announce that the FBI was looking into links between Trump‚Äôs campaign and the Russian Government. It is clear (though some still argue) that Russia actively worked to influence the outcome of the US Presidential election. They did this by hacking and releasing information on Hillary Clinton, and by creating and promoting incendiary and false news stories online. The Obama Administration knew about this and got real mad at Russia, basically kicking all of their diplomats out of the country and creating new sanctions. There are two main concerns that the FBI (and other agencies, including congress) have been looking into. 1. Whether the Trump campaign was in communication with the Russians before or after the election to say that the Obama sanctions wouldn‚Äôt last. (This would be bad. Basically actively working against the existing government of the United States, which is illegal.) 2. Whether the Trump campaign actively worked with the Russians to time the release of negative information on Hillary Clinton. (This would be even worse. Both could be considered treason.) A number of people in Trump‚Äôs campaign and also his current team had conversations with Russian diplomats and lied about it. This includes Mike Flynn, who definitely violated the law and who was fired for lying to VP Pence about it. It also includes Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who agreed that he would not be involved in the Russia investigations because he lied under oath about it. The FBI has had an on-going investigation into this stuff the whole time, and James Comey has been leading that investigation. Quick note, a Grand Jury is a citizen panel that decides whether there‚Äôs enough evidence to try a case. These are usually secret, in order to protect the people who might not be even brought to trial, much less found guilty. But sometimes they need to gather information, like documents or testimony. And they do this with court summonses called subpoenas. Well, yesterday, CNN reported that a Federal Grand Jury investigating Mike Flynn and the Trump Campaigns ties to Russia exists. That Grand Jury has issued subpoenas for more information, indicating to experts a high level of seriousness to the investigation. It‚Äôs pretty clear that Trump campaign knows about this, and as it‚Äôs a Federal case, it was likely overseen by the FBI director, James Comey. Suddenly, just before that story came out, the Trump team decided that Comey‚Äôs treatment of Hillary‚Äôs emails was bad, and fired him. The recommendation to fire Comey came from AG Sessions, who, again, recused himself from the Russia investigation after lying under oath. To be clear, both Sessions and Trump have previously praised Comey at length for his treatment of that investigation. The response from Dems and also many Reps has been shock. It is very concerning for a President to fire someone who is investigating him. This seems to have happened very quickly. Comey found out he was fired the same time as everyone else, the letter Trump wrote to him was delivered to DC, but Comey was in Los Angeles at the time. Of course, the Deputy Director of the FBI is now in charge, but Trump has the job of appointing a new director, and has not made any sign that he has a list of candidates. This seems the sort of thing that most congressional lawmakers, who have a mandate to check the power of the President, should be very worried about. Many are calling for a Special Prosecutor, who would be free to work without congressional approval, to be appointed. Others want broad, unanimous support for Comey‚Äôs replacement, which would ensure someone who is not under Trump‚Äôs thumb. The power to grant these things lies with congress. A congress that is controlled by the President‚Äôs party, but not by the President. And that is where we are. It is pretty convoluted, thank you for taking the time to read. The controversial points in this are: 1 Whether the Russian government hacked Hillary‚Äôs emails (many Republicans say there is no proof while every intelligence agency in the US said that it was orchestrated by the Russian government. 2. Whether Jeff Sessions lied under oath or if he just misspoke or forgot that he had met with Russian officials. In any case, he agreed to remove himself from the congressional investigation. 3. Whether the Trump Campaign investigation was the cause of Comey‚Äôs firing. The stated reason is that Comey ‚Äúlost credibility‚Äù and damaged the reputation of the FBI by mis-handling the Clinton email investigation. That‚Äôs as good as I can do, it feels like it‚Äôs a good deal more comprehensive and concise than most of what I‚Äôve been reading. If it helped you, please show it around. " False text

It‚Äôs a sharp, persistent throb from the back of his head through to behind his eyes.Second, Yuri is lying on top of him, apparently asleep.He notices more things eventually. He notices that he‚Äôs in a hospital and hooked up to a softly chirping heart monitor. He notices that the fluorescent lights over his head are entirely too bright and not at all helping the pain in his head.Then he notices that he can‚Äôt quite remember how he got here, which is somehow more alarming than the alternative.He lifts one hand, heart rate monitor still clipped onto his index finger, and rubs his eye. It sends a sharp ‚Äì well, sharper¬†‚Äì lance of pain through his head, and he groans and drops his hand again.On his chest, Yuri stirs. Then he jolts.‚ÄúBeka!‚ÄùGod,¬†and he thought the lighting was bad.‚ÄúNot so loud,‚Äù he mutters.Yuri scrambles to an upright position, which hurts, but only in the usual please-get-your-elbow-out-of-my-solar-plexus kind of way, so all it earns is a grunt of discomfort.‚ÄúAre you okay? Can you see? Can you‚Ä¶‚Äù‚ÄúQuieter,‚Äù he interjects.Yuri drops his voice to near whisper, crawls off the bed.‚ÄúBeka,‚Äù he says, practically a whisper,¬†‚Äúcan you move?‚Äù‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather not,‚Äù he answers.‚ÄúBeka, this is important. You hit your head really bad. The doctor says you also took some torsion to the neck. Can you move?‚ÄùHe feels a soft jolt of alarm through the fog of pain.

Surely only an Aristocratic Intellectual, like the Earl of Oxford, could be responsible!‚Äú¬† Honestly fuck off. Shakespeare was one of us. His plays were written for the masses. He was an ordinary man who captured the voice of the people and the depths of their emotions. We credit Shakespeare with making up words and phrases, but who‚Äôs to say he wasn‚Äôt writing down what he heard on the streets?¬†""But something as complex as Hamlet could never have been written by Shakespeare! It must have been the work of a nobleman!‚Äù Well guess what, not only did he write it, but he wrote it because that‚Äôs what his audience liked. The hordes of ordinary people consumed his deeply philosophical play about a young man musing over life and death and sin and they LOVED it.¬†  Shakespeare was a crowd-pleaser and an entertainer, and reason his work is so beautiful and poetic and philosophical (as well as bloody and sexual!) is because he was responding to popular demand. Most people attending the theatre were illiterate; they consumed literature by listening, and this is one of the reasons why playwrights utilised iambic pentameter and rhyming schemes. Their dialogue is poetry, and it‚Äôs beautiful to listen to. The first time Romeo and Juliet meet, their shared dialogue creates a sonnet. Imagine a commoner sitting in the crowd listening to that, and it hits him like an arrow, wow, listen to the way these characters speak,¬†this is love at first sight.¬† Shakespeare was an ordinary man, and the beauty and complexity of his works were fuelled largely by the appetite of ordinary people. Although plays could be written and performed for the aristocracy, it was the hordes at the theatres that one had to keep happy. This¬†modern obsession with putting him on a pedestal and trying to make him high culture or inaccessible to ordinary people is just gross. This upstart crow will always be one of us, and his work will always be for us.  Just to add on a bit, I was an English major, and I remember once in college, my linguist professor was discussing Shakespeare, and how he created new words. She said that linguists have studied the languages of the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries, and they‚Äôve basically come to the conclusion that Shakespeare didn‚Äôt invent these new words, at all. They theorize that he actually picked up these words from young women who would use them, as slang speech. Slang speech in these centuries can be found in letters young women wrote to each other, with the slang coming from them shortening words, in order to write faster. Of course, women‚Äôs ways of talking have constantly been looked down upon throughout society, but here‚Äôs an article from Smithsonian, discussing the fact that young women throughout history have shaped language, and continue to do so. They say that what holds men back (men trail by about a generation) is the fact that they make fun of the way in which women talk. http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/teenage-girls-have-been-revolutionizing-language-16th-century-180956216/  Classism sneaks up on you, it really does. It took me years to really start unlearning it.I have one very clear memory, I was in elementary school or middle school, I believe, and we were assigned to read a short prose piece about poverty. I remember really liking it. It had one passage that was very evocative and really made me love it and think about its message:  Poverty is an acid that drips on pride until all pride is worn away. Poverty is a chisel that chips on honor until honor is worn away. Some of you say that you would do something in my situation, and maybe you would, for the first week or the first month, but for year after year after year?  Poverty is an acid. I am still impressed by that phrasing. (Incidentally, I looked it up and the whole text of this piece is here if you want to read it.)Anyway, when we‚Äôd all read through it, the teacher began the usual rigmarole of asking questions about it. Basic stuff, since we were still pretty young. Name some metaphors she used, some similes.Then, who do you think this author is? I raised my hand.‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a poor woman,‚Äù I said.I remember so vividly¬†that my teacher chuckled. In that condescending, isn‚Äôt that cute¬†sort of way.¬†‚ÄúWell, she clearly got an excellent education, didn‚Äôt she? She writes so well,‚Äù she said to me.¬†‚ÄúSo she can‚Äôt be that poor.‚ÄùThe rest of the class nodded; this made perfect sense to them. It didn‚Äôt at first to me, but if you keep repeating a lie long enough it feels like truth.It wasn‚Äôt until years later that I realized how truly fucked up it was, and how easy it was for my teacher to say it, and for everyone to readily accept it.What precludes a poor person from being a talented writer? Why is an education so necessary for talent, and how do you explain the greatest artists in history who didn‚Äôt have one? And why is it so easy to assume these things?Years later, I looked it up. Jo Goodwin-Parker was¬†poor, for a very long time. Fuck you, Ms. Ellison. It took me years to crawl out of that classist bullshit you started by chuckling condescendingly at my correct and prudent observation." False text

Can you? I am capable of the act, yes. Then you should. May I? The answer to that is also yes. My mother told me that violence was never the answer. My mother told me I was handsome; you can‚Äôt always listen to your mother. What happened to letting the other guy throw the first punch? Nazis don‚Äôt throw the first punch. Nazis burn the first Reichstag. Aren‚Äôt the Left supposed to be the tolerant ones? Supposed to be the smart ones, too, but they keep falling for that ‚ÄúI  thought you were supposed to be the tolerant ones‚Äù horseshit. What about dialogue? Dialogue is for reasonable people acting in good faith. Dialogue is  between two acceptable positions. ‚ÄúTaxes need to be raised‚Äù vs. ‚Äútaxes  need to be lowered‚Äù is grounds for dialogue. ‚ÄúTaxes need to be raised‚Äù  vs. ‚ÄúJews should be thrown in ovens‚Äù is grounds for a beating. But isn‚Äôt this sinking to their level? That depends. After you punch the Nazi, do you espouse the tenets of National Socialism? No. Then you‚Äôre better than a Nazi. But doesn‚Äôt this just give the other side ammunition? The other side in this argument are lying fucks who can twist any  piece of information into a swastika-shaped balloon animal if you engage  them in good faith; lacking a piece of information, they‚Äôll just make  shit up. Might as well punch a Nazi. What about peace, love, and understanding? Great goals, and once we get rid of the Nazis we can get to work on  them. All three are completely impossible when Nazis are about. When should you punch a Nazi? Whenever you get a chance. Preferably when they‚Äôre not looking. What if they‚Äôre smaller than you? Hit them with your fist. What if they‚Äôre bigger? Hit them with a bat. Isn‚Äôt this a slippery slope? After we defeated the Nazis in World War II, did we keep shooting people or did the troops come home and start having babies? The second thing. There you go. The slippery slope argument is nine times out of ten  bullshit. Human beings are good with slippery slopes: we build stairs. What if you think you‚Äôre punching a Nazi, but you just hit a white guy with a shitty haircut? Run. What should you do if you hit a Nazi? You should run then, too. Don‚Äôt get me wrong: punching Nazis is still illegal. We‚Äôre discussing morality. But I don‚Äôt want to punch anyone. Then get off your duff, mister, and give aid and support to the boys on the front lines. We‚Äôre all in this together. Again. " False link

He also criticized the media for covering the transition to Trump as normal, even as Obama and Trump had a civil meeting on Thursday and Schumer, the incoming Democratic leader, spoke with Trump on Wednesday. ‚ÄúWe as a nation must find a way to move forward without consigning those who Trump has threatened to the shadows. Their fear is entirely rational, because Donald Trump has talked openly about doing terrible things to them,‚Äú Reid said. ‚ÄúEvery news piece that breathlessly obsesses over inauguration preparations compounds their fear by normalizing a man who has threatened to tear families apart, who has bragged about sexually assaulting women and who has directed crowds of thousands to intimidate reporters and assault African-Americans.

By my estimation, I have about five days left to live, so I must write this quickly.Alone in his cell as the world breaks around him, Silas of House Olen scratches out a desperate biography. He has walked with queens, run from a shattering city, watched a great shadow swallow the sun. He has met a god and fallen in love with him ‚Äî and now he is going to die.I never pictured myself ever writing an autobiography, though that may be due in large part to the fact that I never really considered I might have a life worthy of one. But here at the end of all things, alone in my prison cell, while the very world crumbles around the city, I understand the urgency of giving this dreadful sundering a narrative and context.Silas is a Godspeaker, a single mortal chosen among thousands to be the mouth and the hands and the will of a god ‚Äî in his case, the Night Father, Umbrion. It‚Äôs a tremendous position for awkward, anxious, stuttering Silas, but no sooner had he taken up the mantle had his patron god killed the queen and broke the city in twain.Now he is an unwilling footsoldier in a war between the gods, as great demons rise up from the sea, and as all of Andelan fights to survive.    ONLY A FEW HOURS LEFT ON THIS GEDDIT NOW!!  HAPPY BIRTHDAY TESSA!!!!!!!!  Thank you!!! :D I‚Äôm 27 in case anyone‚Äôs wondering" False link
