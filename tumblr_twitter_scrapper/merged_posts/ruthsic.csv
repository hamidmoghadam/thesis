Ahhhh yeah I definitely read that phrasing wrong. We absolutely always record with all the actors in the same room (except for a few, tiny instances). I would never think about recording a different way, which is why I think I interpreted this question differently - actors can play with their performances a lot more when they’re with their scene partner!

DRINK WATER - I almost forgot but it’s extremely important.  Clear or white discharge is normal. If the colors change, go see a doctor.  *I think I’m gonna add to this daily.  The soap part is extremely hard for people.  Women think that because the soap has a nice smell it will make them smell like that. Nah we have our own smell and the man made smell of Country Apple will taint that.  I know  ✨The Gospel  The key to vaginal excellence  a small note about discharge because sometimes white discharge could be a sign of a yeast infection. just make sure you’re mindful of what’s normal for you and your vag  I do not care if this messes up my blog. This is important. For that case (on white discharge), it depends on the amount. My doctor told me this.  If it’s white or clear, you’re good. If it’s white, clumpy (cottage cheese like), has a bad smell & increased in usual amount, then it might be a problem. Make an appointment and get checked.  Now ladies, yeast is already present in your vagina, so it’s kind of unrealistic to get rid of all yeast. Too much yeast is not good. The goal is to reduce the over growth of yeast & get your vagina back to a healthy balance.  Treatments consists of, anti fungal agents in forms of tablets. I know. Some people can’t really swallow tablets or have a trouble swallowing tablets. I feel you baby, I have the same problem. You can also use vaginal creams. Over the counter treatments are available, however, if you are pregnant, please, make sure any medications are approved by your doctor. You should get medications approved regardless, but if you’re pregnant, MAKE SURE you check back with your doctor.  Also, yeast infections are not commonly transmitted during sex and partners are not usually treated, unless they show signs. As in, itching or irritation in their genital area. Treatment for male partners consists of fungicidal cream on the penis.  Sometimes you might be a little unbalanced & that’s okay, just make sure you get to your Doctor & get on making yourself healthy again.  Some prevention and treatment guidelines for vaginal infections: Have new partners wear condoms during sexual intercourse.  Stay healthy; eat well, get enough sleep, drink enough fluids.  Keep vaginal area clean and dry.  ALWAYS wipe from front to back after urination or bowel movement. You should know why. You don’t want no bacteria going all in your vagina.  Avoid using deodorant pads or tampons.  Don’t use petroleum jelly or other oils for lubricants.  Don’t douche.  Use medication as long as directed.  Avoid sexual intercourse until treatment is completed and you are symptom free.  Don’t scratch infected or inflamed areas; it can cause further irritation.  If using medication inside the vagina, use it during the menstrual period.  During an infection, use pads rather than tampons if menstruation occurs.  Avoid vulvo/vaginal irritants, including perfumed or deodorant soaps/body washes.  If symptoms persist after completing the treatment, an exam is indicated. Call for an appointment, and please use nothing in the vagina for 48 hours prior to your exam.  Get/stay healthy ladies. I love you. Also, my doctor told me to stop shaving earlier this month when I went to go see her. Pubic hair grows there for a reason. It’s not meant for you to shave off. It’s their to protect you. Yes, you can trim it. But don’t shave it all, or constantly shave. Giving yourself a fresh shave here and there is fine. But keep in mind that hair grows their for a reason. This is for women & men. If someone complains about your hairs, punch them in the neck. (Not literally) But, understand that they’re childish & they don’t deserve the cookie or magic stick anyways. God bless & Happy Holidays.  raw cranberry juice (tastes like beet juice but can be diluted with water and unbleached sugar to help the taste) and probiotics like the ones that are in yogurt are also good for urinary and sexual health. 😊   Keep it right ladies 🙌🏾  Ladies 💁🏽💁🏽  For the ladies that follow me. Take care of yourselves  For people with vaginas.  Also it seems like, the older you get the more sensitive it becomes to soap etc.  I had to stop using soap and panty liners all together to try to avoid yeast infections. I’ve found thick cotton panties, like Hanes or fruit of the loom boy shorts work best. The absorb the most.  The 5 five for 25 panties aren’t going to do shit for you if you are heavy discharge person most of the time.  I cosign on the cotton boy shorts if you have a lot of discharge! They’re cuter than granny panties. Also cotton thongs from VS are a blessing. If you use soap, only use Dove, and only a little bit on your vulva NOWHERE ELSE. Drink lots of water. Fun fact: unhealthy semen can fuck up your pH balance, as well as unprotected sex in general.   reblogging as a fan of healthy vaginas.   I, too, support healthy vaginas, take care of yourself ladies  Who puttin regular soap on they cootie cat. Are yall not burning? " False text

HE IS A HORRIBLE PERSON. and my prof was like well yeah i hate him but i don’t HATE hate him. and we argued about it. so he took a poll of who hated taylor.

The survey, conducted by Ipsos, gathered responses from the girls and young women aged 15-19 in all states and territories.In the survey report, entitled Don’t send me that pic, participants reported that online sexual abuse and harassment were becoming a normal part of their everyday interactions. And while the behavior seemed so common, more than 80% said it was unacceptable for boyfriends to request naked images.” “Some see sex only in terms of performance, where what counts most is the boy enjoying it. I asked a 15-year-old about her first sexual experience. She replied: “I think my body looked OK. He seemed to enjoy it.” Many girls seem cut off from their own sense of pleasure or intimacy. The main marker of a “good” sexual encounter is only if he enjoyed it. Girls and young women are under a lot of pressure to give boys and men what they want, to become a real life embodiment of what the boys have watched in porn, adopting exaggerated roles and behaviors and providing their bodies as mere sex aids. Growing up in today’s porn culture, girls quickly learn that they are service stations for male gratification and pleasure.When asked, “How do you know a guy likes you?,” an 8th grade girl replied: “He still wants to talk to you after you [give him oral sex].” A male high school student said to a girl: “If you [give me oral sex] I’ll give you a kiss.” Girls are expected to provide sex acts for tokens of affection, and are coached through it by porn-taught boys. A 15-year-old girl said she didn’t enjoy sex at all, but that getting it out of the way quickly was the only way her boyfriend would stop pressuring her and watch a movie. 7th grade girls are increasingly seeking help on what to do about requests for naked images. Receiving texts like “send me a picture of your tits” is an almost daily occurrence for many young girls. The girl asks: “How do I say no without hurting his feelings?””   WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK? You know what is sad? I am not surprised. We are raised to think of the guy’s feelings before thinking of our own boundaries and personhood. UGH UGH.

The delegates were appalled by the lack of gender equality in America. They found the U.S. to be lagging far behind international human rights standards in a number of areas, including its 23 percent gender pay gap, maternity leave, affordable child care and the treatment of female migrants in detention centers. The most telling moment of the trip, the women told reporters on Friday, was when they visited an abortion clinic in Alabama and experienced the hostile political climate around women’s reproductive rights.  “We were harassed. There were two vigilante men waiting to insult us,” said Frances Raday, the delegate from the U.K. The men repeatedly shouted, “You’re murdering children!” at them as soon as they neared the clinic, even though Raday said they are clearly past childbearing age.  “It’s a kind of terrorism,” added Eleonora Zielinska, the delegate from Poland. “To us, it was shocking.” In most European countries, she explained, abortions are performed at general doctors’ offices and hospitals that offer all kinds of other health services, so there aren’t protesters waiting to heckle the women who enter. The women discovered during their visit that women in the United States have “missing rights” compared to the rest of the world. For instance, the U.S. is one of three countries in the world that does not guarantee women paid maternity leave. The U.N. suggests that countries guarantee at least 14 weeks of paid parental leave. Some countries go further – Iceland requires five months paid leave for each parent, and an additional two months to be shared between them.  “The lack of accommodation in the workplace to women’s pregnancy, birth and post-natal needs is shocking,” Raday said. “Unthinkable in any society, and certainly one of the richest societies in the world.”  Another main area of concern for the delegation is violence against women – particularly gun violence. Women are 11 times more likely to be killed by a gun in the United States than in other high-income countries, and most of those murdersare perpetrated by an intimate partner. While the Obama administration has talked a lot about combatting violence against women, its efforts have been frustrated by Congress’ inability to pass new federal gun restrictions.   While the delegates were shocked by many things they saw in the U.S., perhaps the biggest surprise of their trip, they said, was learning that women in the country don’t seem to know what they’re missing. “So many people really believe that U.S. women are way better off with respect to rights than any woman in the world,” Raday said. “They would say, ‘Prove it! What do you mean other people have paid maternity leave?’”  The US is so far behind in women’s rights, people don’t even believe that other countries allow Paid. Maternity. Leave. Good lord.  But “feminism isn’t needed in the first world!” " False link

At the time, women who studied martial arts were almost unheard of. However, her talents caught the attention of the Great Grandmaster Fu Wing Way, one of the most decorated martial artists in China and founder of Fu Style Tai Chi. He ended up taking her in as his private student. In 1984, Mark won a gold medal at the first International Tournament of T’ai chi ch’uan in Wuhan City. In 1995, she was named Black Belt magazine’s Kung-Fu artist of the year. Before Mark immigrated to the U.S., she was already famous all over China not just because she was a talented female martial artist, but because she was also better than most men in her craft. “Everything is harder for a woman,” Mark told NextShark with some help in translating from her daughter Chris Yen.  “If a man has to work at 100% to excel, a woman must work at 150%! Not just in martial arts but in any field in order to be taken seriously.” Mark with Donnie Yen and his sister, Chris Yen.After teaching at her master’s school for 10 years, she emigrated to Boston, Massachusetts in 1975 where she became one of the first people to introduce Wushu to the West. “There were only a few Chinese kung-fu schools in Chinatown and mostly karate schools around the suburbs,” Mark said. “My school was the first Chinese ‘Wushu’ school and at the time, Wushu was not known yet in the West.” As a successful martial arts master who’s had students open up schools themselves, Sifu Mark broke down what makes a good teacher. She notes that while there are many styles of Tai Chi, all tai chi can be judged by six characteristics and six requirements: “The characteristics are that the movement should be circular, relaxed, calm, continuous, and done with intent and energy. The requirements are that the spine is naturally straight, the shoulders and elbows are sunk, the chest is empty, the movement originates in the waist, the pelvis is at a natural angle, and yin and yang are clear.” Watch an interview with Bow-sim Mark here.

John Bercow, who was a Conservative MP before he becoming the politically neutral presiding officer, said said he would personally block any attempt to allow Trump to address both houses of parliament in the medieval Westminster Hall, an honour given to Barack Obama in 2011. In a rare break with convention, Bercow declared in no uncertain terms his opposition to the state visit. “We value our relationship with the United States,” Bercow said in response to a point of order from Labour MP Stephen Doughty. “If a state visit takes place, that is way beyond beyond and above the pay grade of the speaker. “However, as far as this place [the House of Commons] is concerned, I feel very strongly that our opposition to racism and to sexism and our support for equality before the law and an independent judiciary are hugely important considerations in the House of Commons.

Baby SJW me did good. I just recently rediscovered this and I’m so proud of small me.  Representation matters, y’all.  I’m not really a YA reader but representation in the sense you’re referring to is unimportant. I don’t read because I want to find a great book that includes other groups, I read because I want well written stories and characters regardless of the group they fall into. Your idea forces authors to include things they might have not wanted in their book and I think that is bad. Authors should have complete freedom. The absence of these elements does not rule out the ability to relate to a character. As a manga reader, some of my favourite characters aren’t even human. Relating by race, gender, etc is kinda shallow. Character complexity is so much better. BTW I’m african  And to the left, we have the prime example that you can be ignorant AND marginalized. Write it down, ppl. Take pics if you like.  Bulmakur: I was just like you once. I used to think that it was kind of shallow to only relate to a character if you looked like them. After all, if you share common interests, or something besides appearances, you should be able to relate to them at least a little bit, right? And I used to only read for the same reasons you do: a well-written story with a good plot and complex characters. Bonus if it takes place in another world and has excellent worldbuilding. But now that I’ve been following bookavid for a while, and reading all of her posts, I don’t think that way anymore. To start with, diversity and representation involves so much more than appearances and gender. It involves culture, and experiences, and different points of view. To limit diversity and representation to appearance and gender alone is missing the point. And no, authors should not have “complete freedom.” That lets authors who write problematic works off the hook way too easily. A work that is racist, or ableist, or any of the other ists should be called out as such and the author needs to be told that writing that way is not okay. Freedom is good, yes. I’m all for free speech, and writing is a form of that. But “complete freedom” means there’s no accountability, which isn’t good. As an author, if I write something that a marginalized person is hurt by, I want them to tell me so I can fix it. It’s not forcing me to have something in my story that I didn’t want. And even if it was, I don’t matter in that situation. If I hurt someone, that’s what matters, and I need to do something about it. I never want my stories to hurt anyone. I don’t want to be a problematic author. You say “regardless of the group they fall into,” but if there’s no diversity, doesn’t that get boring after a while? I mean, if you do that for long enough, it’s almost the same set of characters again, and again, and again. Why would you want to read that? That’s so boring to me. You also say “the absence of these elements does not rule out the ability to relate to a character.” But people like it when characters look like them. I remember the months before Moana came out and all I’d seen were the previews. Along with those I saw so many stories of Pacific Islander little girls who were so excited to have a Disney Princess that looked like them. Darker skin, dark, curly hair, not so skinny, and more, I’m sure. I can’t see Moana without also hearing echoes in my head of those little girls. “She looks like me!!!” with so much excitement you’d think it was the best thing in the world. So yeah. Appearances matter. Diversity matters. Representation matters. While I’m here, I’d just like to say a huge Thank You to bookavid for totally changing the way I view diversity. As a white, able-bodied young woman, I really appreciate what you’ve been doing, because it’s called attention to things I’ve been doing wrong and how I can maybe change them. I decided to focus a lot more on diversity in my own stories thanks to you. So, thank you so much, for all that you do. (Sorry for hijacking this post. If anything that I’ve said above in wrong or hurtful in any way please please let me know and I’ll fix it.)  ^^ this tumblr user is why i blog" False link
