But seriously - this is something that apparently happens to people who are low-key (or not so low-key) disassociating semi-constantly, and is really really not good for you. So if you’re one of those people, like me! then there are other forms of mindfulness that may be more appropriate for you - specifically touch/sensation based, rather than the guided-thinking, breath- and sensory-focusing exercises that make up traditional mindfulness programs/exercises. Talk to your local health care professional if at all possible.  But basically, if you know you have issues with disassociation, and somebody recommends a mindfulness program to you, BRING UP THE FACT THAT YOU DISASSOCIATE. Because normal mindfulness can be super bad for you. There ARE apparently mindfulness programs that can be helpful, but they have to be catered to the disassociation. So. Please bear that in mind, everybody.  To add: mindfulness practices are also contraindicated for people who experience psychosis, paranoia, or hallucinations, and there’s debate over how safe they are for people who live with OCD.  We post a lot of stuff about mindfulness and related practices, so this is a really important disclaimer! The world pushes a lot of self care practices, whether they be yoga, meditation/mindfulness, or exercise. But remember that this sort of thing is not one-size-fits-all. Make the choices that make sense for you, and definitely don’t put yourself in a dangerous place just because a blog says so 😜" False text

Cane-users, please add any tips you have! 1. Get a cane that fits! Canes come in different sizes and some are adjustable. I use an adjustable metal cane which I purchased on the advice of my physiotherapist. He made sure it was adjusted to my size- right at where my wrist dangles 2. Get a cane you’ll use! If you want to get specific about the colour, material, or feel, go with your first choice because a cane purchase is a long lasting item in frequent use. It won’t help you if you won’t use it.  3. If you’re using your cane for joint damage, remember the rule good goes to heaven, bad goes to hell. Not only a judgy religious concept! It simply means that when you climb stairs you step up with your better leg and down with your worse leg. 4. Pick a cane style that’s right for you. There are forearm crutch type cane, foam wrapped handles, canes with four prongs at the bottom, different weights, etc. Talk to your doctor/physio/occupational therapist about what kind of cane is most useful for your situation. If you have trouble with your wrists, for example, a forearm cane or two might be better.  5. Use a wrist strap! I’m not good at bending or balancing or getting up, so dropping my cane is an issue for me. I bought a cane with a bracelet wrist strap so if I need to let go I don’t have to balance it precariously on something, I can use my hands without worrying about dropping it @spooniestrong @spoonie-living @cripples-r-us-swag @cripplechronicles @flimsywrists, anything to add?  Great stuff, especially the point that it won’t help you if you won’t use it.Our additions:6. Consider how “medical” you want your cane to look. A cane is a great way to signal that you need extra time, space, or help: if your disability isn’t visible, you can use your mobility device to communicate that. A metal cane with foam handle might be a clearer signal than, say, a fancy wooden cane or walking stick that could be mistaken for a fashion statement. 7. Make sure you’re having fun with it. Pick a pattern you like, add a charm to the wrist loop, find some cute stickers… make it yours! You can find some fun mod ideas under our DIY tag and Mobility Aid tag. If your cane looks well-loved and well-used, you may get the bonus effect of not getting those obnoxious “Oh no, what happened?” responses from random folks you encounter.8. If you don’t use your cane all the time and could leave it somewhere by accident, you may want to put a little “If Found” sticker on it.Readers, feel free to reblog with more!" False text

The eternal struggle! I’ve certainly been there. I love cooking, but all that standing and walking was really getting me down. So, I got a couple of great pieces from Ikea, and now cooking is way easier. Here’s what I do: 1) Keep a high chair in the kitchen. I live with 3 other people, so I needed one that could be folded and tucked away as needed. For me, the most important features were a backrest and a footrest, so I settled on the FRANKLIN Bar stool ($45) from Ikea. Check it out in action: [Image description: A kitchen countertop, with a stove, a high chair, and a cart full of food and dishes.] It puts me at just the right height for the counter, and I can position it so I can reach the stove and the counter with no problems. I’ve also found that it slides pretty nicely on the floor without any scuffs, so I’ll sometimes push myself around using the counters. PRO TIP: I always keep a water bottle with me when cooking–that’s some hard work I’m doing, and I gotta stay hydrated! Plus, it’s great to have a little water on hand; I’ll drip a little into the pan to get a feel for how hot my oil is, or add a little when I need it for my recipe. [Image: A kitchen counter and sink, with a high chair and a cart loaded with dirty dishes.] I can also use it for washing the dishes! Again, everything is in easy reach, so I’m good to go. This chair has been worth the price ten times over by now. You might be wondering about that cart–and, in fact, that’s the next part of my disabled cooking setup!  This is the RÅSKOG utility cart ($29.99) from Ikea: an item that I had been drooling over for years, which just dropped in price from a whopping $80 (thank the Swedish gods!). I bought it for myself without a use in mind, but once I got the chair I realized what a great addition this would make.  You see, it’s got wheels (albeit kind of dinky ones), and multiple levels, so you can hit the fridge, pantry, and cabinets to load up on all the things you need for your cooking adventure. Here was my setup for some yummy fried rice: [Image: A closeup of the loaded cart, with a variety of foods and dishes piled on its three shelves.] All the foods and tools I need in one convenient spot! I transfer them over to the counter and stovetop as needed, and then throw them back on the cart when I’m done. For example, foods that need to go back to the fridge get the top shelf, and dishes that need washing get the bottom. Then, when I’m all done, I just wheel it over to the fridge and the sink to clean up! The crowning glory to this setup, though, is the small bins you see hanging from the edge of the cart. These are containers from Ikea’s BYGEL series ($0.99 ea.). The black one is for regular trash, green is for composting, and red is for recycling! I don’t always use these, but when I do they are super handy and keep me from having to walk around to various trash/recycle/compost bins. The only drawback is that these containers have small holes at the bottom, so drippy compost is a little complicated. This could easily be solved with small composting bags, though, or a number of other little fixes. There are probably some hanging containers more suited to this, too. This whole setup has been treating me really well, and can be adjusted for how I’m feeling and how complicated my recipe is. Lately, I’ve been more mobile and have just been using the chair, but I have everything I need if I’m tired or want to take on something big. I hope this inspires you to take control of your kitchen and get cookin’! :)  I went to IKEA to try and find a high chair like this, I tried the Franklin, but got so exhausted I couldn’t work out exactly what I wanted and ended up leaving it because I was in too much pain to think. Any tips on the best height for perching over a sink? How do you stop your knees knocking into the cabinets?  Eek, sorry to hear you had such an unpleasant IKEA visit :’( For all its cheap furniture and yummy meatballs, it sure is a special kind of a spoonie hell.Honestly, the best height has a lot to do with how high your kitchen counters are and how tall your torso is. I think mine is the taller of the two, and for perching over the sink I would expect that higher would be better.The knees thing is definitely a challenge, and a bit inescapable if you want to be sitting in the kitchen. To reduce the impact, I tend to sit at an angle to the counter, with my dominant side closer in. But if you’re better at bending forward than turning your torso, you might find it easier to give yourself some extra knee room between the chair and the counter. Your mileage may vary on that one.Hope that’s useful!—Editor Diane" False text

I think one the bad parts of being neurotypical is that you don’t get so many of the amazing parts of being, for example, autistic. Neurotypical people can fidget, for instance, but they can’t ever know how good it feels to have your body just flow into a stim, to feel your thoughts start lining up or your body get comfortable when you stim the way you need to. Autistic people (and some others!) have this amazing experience where our bodies find motions that express and comfort and regulate in ways that neurotypical people can never fully understand. And neurotypical people can enjoy sensory experiences, but to be autistic is to have a unique relationship with sensory input. So much of our sensory experiences are amplified compared to those of NTs , and while that can and does cause overload etc. sometimes… when the input is good? It’s glorious. Good fabrics and good sounds and good smells and good tastes and textures - we get to feel them all more intensely.  And echolalia! Echolalia is so good and so enjoyable and neurotypical people, I think, get only the barest shadow of what it’s like.  NTs can have hobbies and passions and callings, but they can’t ever, ever know the pure and consuming joy that is a special interest. There are good and bad parts to being autistic. Neurotypicals, you’re going to have to accept that, and along with it the concept that autistic people have good experiences that you, by virtue of being neurotypical, simply cannot have.  You don’t see yourself as an object of pity because you lack those experiences, do you? You aren’t going to pour millions into research to have brains like ours, are you? I mean, even if you could do it, you wouldn’t be you anymore. And the way your brain works is just fine for you, you don’t mind not having good autistic experiences because you have your own!  Well - same. I don’t want to be neurotypical. Being autistic is an integral part of my personality, and I wouldn’t give up my good autistic experiences for a shot at your neurotypical ones in a million years. What I want is to be accepted for who I am as an autistic person, for people to respect and accommodate my needs the way the world respects and accommodates your needs as a neurotypical person.   Also special interests! There’s nothing quite like having a thing that you love and cherish and know so much about and I know I wouldn’t be the same without all of my SIs.   Autistic & other neurodivergent folks, here’s a reminder that you are great, and that neurotypicals have goods and bads too, regardless of what they might want to believe 😉" False text

The above should be helpful to those looking for a feeling of agency, but please don’t let it circle back around and guilt you when you do something you aren’t proud of—messing up is a part of having agency and responsibility.

I’m talking like…boiling pasta can prove to be too difficult for me most times. The best case scenario is something I literally can just pick up and start eating but would ideally have *some* kind of health benefit. What food can I eat that would provide me with the maximum needed nutrients with the absolute bare minimum effort (which doesn’t require me to go out to eat every time i want something)?  At the moment, I’m able to afford a decently wide price range, but I’m open also to suggestions on the cheaper side since I haven’t always been this lucky and am not sure if I will continue to be.  EDIT: I should mention I don’t really have many dietary restrictions. I would ideally like to start keeping​ kosher, but to be perfectly honest, I’m not super strict about that right now and if it means getting myself to eat, I can deal with non-kosher options. Thanks!   @spoonie-living ive seen a number of posts on this blog about this subject, so you might try looking through it heres what i do though if high protein, high fat foods are a priority: full fat greek yogurt can be eaten with no effort and its easy to sweeten (ime it only comes plain – flavored yogurts are all low fat). i also love skyr but that’s more expensive and rare so i buy it as a treat ice cream, in small amounts, is highly nutrious for the same reasons yogurt is granola, especially the kind that promotes itself as energy food, is high in protein. bags of nuts and seeds too. you can buy these in bulk online and save in long run if you can poney up the money now (you know what else you can buy in bulk? fruit snacks)  “hunters” sausage is like a less carcinogenic slim jim. if your store has a deli counter you can check with them if they have any. if they have an in house bakery pay attention to which days they bake – the place near me does a 6/dozen deal on bagels on Sunday because by then theyre ready to bake fresh ones. the bagels will last another week if you store them properly dried fruit is good, not as cheap as nuts though. bananas keep for awhile if you buy them green. im allergic to raw carrot myself but baby carrots are pretty cheap and good eating, full of carotene n all that peanut butter. straight from the jar. you can buy that in bulk too, it lasts forever that’s about all I can think of atm 🤔 good luck  Great advice! You can find lots of general ideas in our Food tag, but we’ve added a bunch of ideas and meal plans below the cut, to cover your specific needs. 💁Readers, anything you’d like to add?Here are a few meals you can gather with a quick lap around the kitchen and eat in pieces—but of course, all of these items can be eaten separately.Fancypants Cheese & Charcuterie Plate (cold)Pre-cut salami, other cured meat, or jerkyString cheese or cheese snacks like Tillamoos CrackersFruitDark chocolate (because you deserve it!)Simple Rice Bowl (hot or cold)Pre-cooked rice pack (ostensibly requires microwaving, but you can probably eat without heating)Seaweed snacksPre-peeled boiled egg (you can buy packages of these)Bonito (dried fish) flakes or furikake, a Japanese mixed seasoning (ymmv if you’re using cold rice, since these sort of melt into the heat)Nacho Plate/Burrito (hot or cold)Tortilla chips or tortillasCanned refried beans or bean dip (regular beans require draining)Shredded cheese or nacho cheeseSalsaAnd here are some random thoughts:Lots of canned goods contain fully-cooked food. If you’re cool with cold soup or Chef Boyardee, lean into it! Veggies, beans, meats, and fruit can be eaten from the can, too, if you’re careful not to spill the liquid.Any granola, nut, fruit, and/or protein bars are great. We particularly recommend LÄRABARs and RxBars. Those yogurt cups with granola and fruit/toppings in the lid.Trader Joe’s forever. If you can, hit up Trader Joe’s for all kind of pre-packaged goodness. There are pre-washed fruits and veggies and all kinds of weird little snackies.Pre-made PB&J or Lunchables (they ought to be in the same place in the store).Baby food. That’s right, we went there. Not all of this stuff will be anywhere near palatable, but you’d be surprised what you’ll find in this section. The ones in little sippy bag things seem to be better overall, and contain both fruits and veggies.Mixed juice/smoothie beverages like Odwalla, especially the green & protein ones.Phew.

I’m reblogging it but I would be that person wondering “Do I need this enough” until I died.  I have legitimately done this. Please, take care of yourselves.  Furthermore, guys, we have dispatch. Dispatch makes sure that we’re all where we need to be, so you’re not taking an ambulance away from someone who “needs it more.”  Let dispatch worry if an ambulance needs to be somewhere else.

There’s both a lot of help… and not a lot of help… for people who are looking to get set up with a service animal. So here are some of the things that I’ve learned since starting this venture. 1. Do not pay some website to ‘certify’ your dog. The reason why is that there is no federal certification for service dogs. The companies you’re paying literally just make little id tags. They don’t mean your dog is really a service dog, and they definitely won’t help you in court. 2. Training. Training. Training. Did I remember training? Training a dog yourself can be a rewarding experience, but to be frank, it may not actually be something you can accomplish on your own. And that’s okay. There are dog trainers out there who will do ALL of the training for you. 3. Get your doctor behind you 100%. This goes for when you have to swap doctors too. I learned that the first question I have to ask is ‘are you okay with service animals in my medical treatment’. You’ll be surprised how many doctor’s offices have NO CLUE about service animals, at all. Try to find one that understands what goes into it, they’ll be able to help you with making sure your dog helps your needs, as well as provide you with paperwork that can come up later. 4. CHECK YOUR INSURANCE. Oh my god I wish I had known about this before. Zeus cost a fortune, and often times we had to choose between regular bills, and paying for Zeus’ training and care. Some insurances, Health cards, etc. cover service animals and their gear. This is where your doctor having your back is important, as the insurance company will usually require proof that you are disabled before they pay anything out. 5. There will be fake service dogs out there. And they will screw up your dog. Don’t be afraid to remove yourself and your dog from the presence of a disruptive dog. 6. People will not always understand. It’s okay. Don’t be afraid when they don’t understand. Just make sure you got your own shit together. That’s what’s important.  Getting a little more service dog info out there for our readers! This list is all about ways to get through the system as easily as possible, without getting duped into spending more money or effort.See also: Am I Disabled Enough For My Service Dog?, from @professional-pup​" False text

The way we talk and this about our bodies and our illnesses can really impact how we feel about ourselves—and although the slights against ourselves might feel small, they can snowball into some pretty bad feels.Kate the (Almost) Great gets the ball rolling with this really useful suggestion:…identify what you are mad at – because you are 100% allowed to feel mad  about your chronic illness. Be mad at the disease itself, psoriatic  arthritis in my case. But don’t blame your body as a whole. Now, consider the differences between these statements:“My body is hurting me” vs. “I’m in pain.”“My body is attacking me” vs. “My illness is attacking me.”The same goes for self-deprecating humor. Something like “I sure made some bad decisions today” can really eat into your confidence when used frequently. Try instead, “My illness got in the way of what I wanted today.”It helps a lot to be in league with your body and your self rather than working against them; all the better to kick that illness’ butt! 💪" True link
