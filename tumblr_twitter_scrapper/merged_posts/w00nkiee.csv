They aim to have a comeback this coming summer, but there are no concrete schedules as of yet”.  With this, BOYFRIEND will be having a comeback in Korea after 2 years since their 4th mini album ‘Boyfriend in Wonderland’ back in 2015. Since then, BOYFRIEND have been gaining popularity both in Korea and overseas through individual activities of musicals, web drama etc and their Japanese promotions and tours.  On the other hand, BOYFRIEND is celebrating their 6th Anniversary on the coming 26th. Having the comeback news relayed to the fans prior to the upcoming special day increases the fans’ anticipation for it.  According to a report from Sports Chosun and Channel A, BOYFRIEND is said to have the comeback in July.    trans: youngmineekkeo/@beatrooot | source: tenasia ; sportschosun ; channel aplease take out with FULL credits.
