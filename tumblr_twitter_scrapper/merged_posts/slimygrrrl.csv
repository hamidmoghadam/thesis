But precisely because everyone’s staring gape-mouthed in his direction, other world leaders are able to get away with almost anything. Don’t believe me? Look one country north, at Justin Trudeau. Look all you want, in fact – he sure is cute, the planet’s only sovereign leader who appears to have recently quit a boy band. And he’s mastered so beautifully the politics of inclusion: compassionate to immigrants, insistent on including women at every level of government. Give him great credit where it’s deserved: in lots of ways he’s the anti-Trump, and it’s no wonder Canadians swooned when he took over. But when it comes to the defining issue of our day, climate change, he’s a brother to the old orange guy in Washington.  Not rhetorically: Trudeau says all the right things, over and over. He’s got no Scott Pruitts in his cabinet: everyone who works for him says the right things. Indeed, they specialize in getting others to say them too – it was Canadian diplomats, and the country’s environment minister, Catherine McKenna, who pushed at the Paris climate talks for a tougher-than-expected goal: holding the planet’s rise in temperature to 1.5C (2.7F).  But those words are meaningless if you keep digging up more carbon and selling it to people to burn, and that’s exactly what Trudeau is doing. He’s hard at work pushing for new pipelines through Canada and the US to carry yet more oil out of Alberta’s tar sands, which is one of the greatest climate disasters on the planet.  Last month, speaking at a Houston petroleum industry gathering, he got a standing ovation from the oilmen for saying: “No country would find 173bn barrels of oil in the ground and just leave them there.” Yes, 173bn barrels is indeed the estimate for recoverable oil in the tar sands. So let’s do some math. If Canada digs up that oil and sells it to people to burn, it will produce, according to the math whizzes at Oil Change International, 30% of the carbon necessary to take us past the 1.5C target that Canada helped set in Paris.  That is to say, Canada, which represents one half of 1% of the planet’s population, is claiming the right to sell the oil that will use up a third of the earth’s remaining carbon budget. Trump is a creep and a danger and unpleasant to look at, but at least he’s not a stunning hypocrite.  Continue Reading. " False link

On Wednesday, the massive adult entertainment destination took the  somewhat surprising step of launching the “Pornhub Sexual Health  Center.”  They’re hoping the free sub-site  will become a go-to resource for some of their 70 million daily users  on all manner of topics, including STIs, sexual safety and how to manage  relationships. They’ve chosen Dr. Laurie Betito, a renowned sex therapist, to direct  the site and they’ll also be working with a number of doctors,  therapists and other experts to offer advice and answer questions.  Corey  Price, Pornhub’s Vice President, told Mashable, “Our goal is  to provide our visitors with a site that has credible and insightful  information, rather than have them scouring the internet.” While it’s a database they’ll build up over time, a first look  reveals they’ve started with the fundamentals — with answers to things  like “Babies. Where do they come from?” and “Are there really three  holes?”  These might seems almost laughably basic to adult consumers of  hardcore porn, but there are a lot of young people for whom these are  very real questions.  Price told Mashable they weren’t aiming the content  specifically at beginners.  He said they simply want to appeal to “those  who are looking for trustworthy sex tips and health advice provided by  experts.”  But it seems like they realize this could prove to be an  especially valuable resource for their younger audience, who most likely  isn’t getting comprehensive (much less sex-positive) sex ed in schools. There are, of course, plenty of online sexual health and education  resources, but for many kids, landing on sites like Pornhub is already  their way into learning about sex.  Porn can obviously teach you plenty  about the basics and mechanics of intercourse, but there’s a whole range  of other things — biology, health, consent, relating to intimate  partners, just to name a few — that you won’t pick up from watching  videos like “Big tits round asses” or “Sloppy throat games.”  So if they can slide their curious audience over to the PSHC while  they’re already on the site, it could function as pretty useful one-stop  shop for filling in the blanks left by spotty sex ed classes and the  birds and bees talks given by often bewildered parents.   Neat!  Holy shit their section on trans people was actually really good and not what I expected from something hosted by a porn site! If they had a containing various sexualities and whatnot as well, they’ll definitely have a good resource on their hands! " False link
