I spent much of the past week speaking with officials and cabinet ministers in Europe. All they wanted to talk about was Trump.  Here, in summary, are the most frequent remarks I heard from them, and from others in my travels, in rough order of frequency: 1. Trump is unstable, and we’re not going to count on anything he says or commits to.  2. Trump doesn’t support NATO or European integration.  3. Trump is actively encouraging racist nationalists in our country.  4. Trump is allied with Putin to bring Europe down.  5. There’s no doubt Trump worked with Putin to win the U.S. presidential election. 6. If Trump’s polls drop too low, he’ll start a war in order to get Americans to rally around him. (Opinions varied on whether Trump’s war would be with North Korea, Iran, terrorists in Nigeria, or an escalation in Syria, Iraq, or Afghanistan.) 7. How did you Americans come to elect this ego-maniac? (Others called him an infant, moron, ignoramus, fool.) 8. He’s another Berlusconi (or Franco, Mussolini, Salazar, Hitler). 9. We remember fascism. We never thought it would happen in America.  10. The world depends on American leadership. We’re very worried. My overall impression: Anti-Trump sentiment is even stronger in Europe than it is in the U.S. If Trump expects his European trip to give him a reprieve from his troubles at home, he’s mistaken.  😰" False text

But I’ve been thinking about this a bit again. Logan dealt with the realities of being a mutant, a human being, and aging in a uniquely difficult, incredible way. But I also actually sympathized with the antagonist’s argument—to an extent—for probably the first time ever for these films. For better and for worse, it’s also violent in a way no other Marvel film can even think about touching (parents and folks with weak stomachs: there are many, many good reasons that it’s R). But at the end of the day, I actually appreciate it. It is legit difficult to watch the violence unfold, mostly Wolverine’s, which I feel is a metaphor for the difficulty of being him and being forced into these situations. The film tackles the reality of these characters in an incredibly personal way, and let’s face it—Wolverine has freaking metal claws; he isn’t back scratching or tickling anyone to death. Anyway. Incredible film. The academy probably won’t give it the credit it deserves, but whatever. If you haven’t seen it yet, and you’re interested in a fantastic drama about people in extraordinary situations, who also happen to be mutants and super (anti-)heroes facing incredibly difficult personal problems and relationships, see Logan. It’s just amazing." True text

One thing I’ve grown to appreciate about the Vainglory match announcers I’ve heard is how damn good they are. Really, bear with me. Vainglory is a competitive MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) for iOS and Android, with three players on each team. There are around 20 heroes to pick in the game, all with unique abilities that have their own names, interactions, and weaknesses. Abilities can apply greater damage, slow the enemy, heal teammates, create damaging barriers, conceal oneself or teammates, and on and on. Vainglory also has an in-match shop from which every player buys attack, defense, and support items throughout the match (not in-app purchases; you earn in-match gold as you achieve objectives or kill enemies). There are probably 40-50 items, each with their unique names, abilities, and interactions. The Vainglory match announcers I’ve heard juggle the depth and breadth of all this stuff amazingly well. They’re familiar with which items are more advantageous for certain characters. When abilities and attacks are triggered, they deftly call everything out, including whether something affected an enemy, was blocked, or got enhanced by a teammate, and they do it all in the middle of crazy split-nanosecond team fights. Even if you aren’t into or familiar with one of these games, it might be worth checking out one of these matches to witness this first hand. I have a thing for MOBAs right now, so Vainglory and League of Legends are good places to start." True text

Thanks to generations of brave women and men who formed secret societies, challenged unjust laws, and started Planned Parenthood health centers in their own towns, we’ve come a long way since. Millions of people, regardless of income or insurance coverage, now have access to birth control, cancer screenings, and STI testing and treatment. Each year, Planned Parenthood proudly provides health information to nearly 70 million people online and 1 million people in classrooms and communities across the country. Today, America is at a 30-year low in unintended pregnancy and a historic low in teen pregnancy. But all of that progress is a reminder of how much women and men in America now stand to lose. Extreme politicians at every level of government are doing everything they can to block millions of people from coming to Planned Parenthood, deny access to affordable health care, and roll back women’s rights over their own bodies. We are facing a national health disaster, especially in our most vulnerable communities. That’s why we’re calling on the tech industry to join Tumblr in standing with Planned Parenthood and standing up for access to health care. A 100-year-old health care provider and the platform powering 335 million blogs may seem like an unlikely pair. But over the last few years, Tumblr and Planned Parenthood have teamed up to provide information and organize communities in support of reproductive rights. We’re proud of all we’ve accomplished together and with overwhelming support from the Tumblr community. Technology has become instrumental in the fight for fairness and equality across a range of issues. It has the power to influence public debate, mobilize communities, and — most importantly — offer creative solutions to help people receive better care, no matter where they live or who they are. Finally, the tech industry owes its success to the brilliant people it employs and the communities it serves — and we cannot take their health for granted. It won’t be easy, but doing nothing isn’t an option when lives are at stake. We need to work together to break down barriers to care and information for the millions of people desperate to take ownership of their sexual and reproductive health, and tackle disparities in health care access and outcomes. Now is the time to be vocal, visible, and active in your support of Planned Parenthood — starting with the #TechStandsWithPP hashtag to share stories about how Planned Parenthood has touched your life, or the life of anyone you know. Call on your co-workers and peers to do the same. In health care, education, and nearly every industry, we’re doing things that would have been unthinkable a century ago. Think of all we can achieve together in the decades to come if we combine the creativity, innovation, and energy of the tech community with Planned Parenthood’s commitment to helping people everywhere — no matter what. — David Karp + Cecile Richards " False text

I hope I’m wrong, I hope this is just a silly conspiracy theory. 1 - Automation and AI The profound changes coming to every aspect of our society, especially jobs, because of robot automation and AI. But it isn’t just about mass production, self-driving cars, and McDonalds checkout counters. Google and China are said to have AIs that can write pretty good press releases and news articles. Some experimental AIs are already outperforming doctors at diagnosing illnesses and injuries. Google has two AIs that just started collaborating on creating their own algorithm, and its engineers don’t know what it does. This stuff is going to affect everything. Everything. 2 - Trump and the GOP’s warmongering On the campaign trail, he casually threatened to nuke countries. In office, he’s picked utterly senseless fights with some of our oldest and closest allies. It’s become apparent that nearly his entire cabinet, and likely Trump himself, either have ties to one of our largest adversaries or are blackmailed by it. Many GOP politicians have deep business and personal relationships with companies that power the war machine. At the absolute least, it certainly seems like none of them are speaking up or pushing back. If automation and AI are about to fundamentally change or wipe out so many aspects of our society that require human beings, what is one grotesque, terrifying solution to that “problem?” What solution would allow these billionaire, authoritarian, kleptocratic usurpers to avoid things like universal basic income or taking on the actual challenge of what to do with humanity in a post-robot and -AI world?

Let me tell you a story. I’m half English, but live in Spain. I get to see my English family, at best, once a year. Sometimes not even that. I love my English grandparents, but we don’t have many things in common. We can get a nice 20 minute talk going about what we’ve been doing lately, and then I usually fall silent whilst my mum talks about cooking with my grandma and my dad goes on to talk about science with my granddad. It’s so disappointing, because I barely see them, and I can only rely on their interest in what I’m doing with my life to start a conversation. A few months ago we flew to England and stayed with them a few days. Whilst having supper, naturally (as always) the conversation started with how I was doing, and what I was planning to do with my future now that I had graduated. I told them I was thinking about moving back to Japan to start working there. Somehow, one way or another, we started talking about life in Japan, and my parents chipped in by commenting on their experience in Tokyo as tourists. “There’s so many people!” And then someone asked, “what’s the population of Japan?” And I said, “Let me google that.” So I pulled out my smartphone. 127.3 million. Can you believe it? That’s a lot! That’s twice as much as the UK, isn’t it? What is the population of the UK? Granddad says 60 million, but grandma says 62. Google says 64.1 million. What about Spain? 50 million, perhaps? 55? Mum says 48, dad says 40. Nope, it’s 46.77 million as of 2014, says google. We all guessed at the population of the US, of Canda, of France, of Germany; we cheered when one of us had almost hit the mark, and gasped at unexpected numbers. We looked up the dates of historical events, we read random wikipedia facts, we searched Stonehenge on google maps and read about the theories behind it, we googled ‘disc symbols ancient’ to try and figure out what this paperweight my granddad had in his office was supposed to be because he couldn’t remember its name and immediately found out it was a replica of the Phaistos Disc. “‘Disc symbols ancient’! How did google know what we were looking for just from that? That’s amazing!” We went on for hours, and it was so. much. fun. For three whole hours, three. whole. fucking. hours, every topic we talked about was somehow linked to googling facts or images on my smartphone, and do you know what my granddad said to me as we started cleaning everything up? He said this thing I had was amazing, and he wanted one too. Technology is not a conversation stopper. It’s a conversation starter, and if you don’t know how to be responsible, if you don’t know how to make use of this amazing thing we have to keep a conversations going, then the problem isn’t smartphones, or facebook, or twitter. It’s you.  That punctuating, reverberating sound you hear is a mic hitting the floor." False text
