It means we wouldn’t do as much work”? you guys remember when PETA advocated killing all pit bulls for the crime of being pit bulls? you guys remember when PETA handed out these comics to children when there were no adults looking?  you guys remember when they made a porn site and then filled it with videos of animal abuse, and (also in that link) claimed cats should be vegetarian? you guys remember when PETA lied about sheep shearing, got caught, and defended the lie as true even after they admitted the sheep in their picture wasn’t even real? you guys remember when they tried to excuse their horrifying ways by claiming that the person who exposed them was manipulating the facts by taking them and putting them in the wrong context? Because I remember. I remember everything.  And I’m gonna make sure everyone else remembers too.   Why would they kill pit bulls they’re sweeties  Because PETA does not care about animals. they do not care that these dogs live and breathe and feel and want love like every other dog. they do not care about the history of human/dog bonding and co-evolution, they do not care that dogs and human beings have relied on each other for millennia, they do not care that its cruel and morally repugnant to put down an animal just because you can, they do not care about animals.  PETA cares about money and publicity, its a corporation run by a psychopath who is afraid of pitts as it states in the link: she was apparently bit by one, and now she hates them.  PETA doesn’t give a rats ass about animals. They just want to kill and make money off of idiots who fall of their spiel.  Some celebs support them  ah c’mon, dear-tumb1r, I think you’re being a bit harsh. I mean, okay, PETA’s done some questionable things, but it’s not like they’ve also -spread false information about milk causing autism based on outdated bullshit information -used holocaust imagery to compare the meat industry to concentration camps (no pictures) -used a young man’s brutal death as a way to say “yeah that’s awful but it happens to animals every day and nobody cares about that” (tw: no pictures but the way the guy died is described and it is really horrible) -dressed up in KKK robes and protested outside of the Westminister Dog Show to protest breeding/pure bred dogs (tw: racism) -offered to pay the water bill for literally the poorest neighborhood in Detroit if and only if they all went vegan for a month (tw: self-righteous shitheads) -and they definitely didn’t have two of their workers accept perfectly healthy animals from an animal hospital, with the implication that they would give them good homes, clarify that these animals were all healthy and well-tempered, and then euthanized them all in the back of a kill-van before dumping their dead bodies behind a grocery store (tw: PICTURES OF DEAD ANIMALS, animal death) -and they totally didn’t get off pretty much scot-free for it because PETA has loads of money and lawyers to defend themselves, which coincidentally might be why the Cerate family hasn’t seen justice for their kidnapped and murdered dog, Maya. (tw: animal death) Nah. PETA’s not that bad. (/the heaviest of all my fucking sarcasm, I am salty as a fucking winter road, lord do I fucking hate PETA)  Did you think i was fucking joking, PETA?

No. No we don’t know about it.  Americans aren’t told this shit.  The only thing we’re taught about any Middle Eastern country in school is that 1) the region exists 2) it’s where The War is happening and 3) Muslim people live there. That’s it. Maybe if you’re lucky you’ll get into the Hammurabi Code and some early Babylonian stuff but American schools seem to think that if it happened outside Europe and before the colonial period, or makes America look bad and isn’t about A Very Watered Down Version of What Slavery Was, it’s not important. Info on this is almost notoriously hard to find. It’s not in any texts on American and Russian involvement in the Middle East during the Cold War that I can find. You have to specifically look for a book about the Shah’s return to power, and even then you’d be hard pressed to find a book like that at your local bookstore. Once you get into some higher level college courses you might know about it, but the people who can afford those are more likely to already be indoctrinated into a certain Way of Thinking (read: they’re racist as shit) by the time they get there. And it’s almost like you have to know about it beforehand if you want to find information on it. The only reason I knew about it is because there’s a thirty second summary of the event in Persepolis. Those thirty seconds flipped my entire worldview.  “All the Shah’s Men” by Stephen Kinzer is a good, accessible text for people who want to know more about this.  !!!  I had to explain literally this to one of my co-workers, who is so fuckin racist against Middle Eastern people it’s insane.  She’s 60. She never heard of this.  As I was explaining this and how, during the Regan years, we funded Osama Bin Laden to fight against Russia, leading to the destruction of much of the infrastructure in the region, one of the plant workers came in to get his badge fixed.  He works in the quality control lab. He served 15 years active duty in the Army. Super smart guy, has a masters in chemistry and another masters in biology, raises saltwater fish in his spare time for sale, has the saltwater aquarium setup of the gods.  Raises rare corals too, some of which he donates to be used in re-seeding reefs around the world, but that’s a side tangent.  And he listened for a minute, then nodded and said “Yeah. I was there during that. I helped train people to fight. They wanted us to help them build schools and hospitals, after, but we were only interested in them as cannon fodder. Left the whole area in ruins. I wasn’t surprised when they hated us for it later. Told people then it would happen. We let them know then that they were only valuable to America as expendable bodies. Why wouldn’t they resent us for that?” And she just looked floored.  “So…” She started, after a few minutes. “What do you think of Trump?” “I hate him. He’s a coward and he’s going to get good people killed.” He didn’t even blink. “ She looked back and forth between us for a second, and then asked how I knew all this.  “I research things.” I said. “Google is great.” He nodded enthusiastically.  And she just sat there for a second and then said, really quietly, “I didn’t know.”  She lived through it.  American schools don’t teach you any of this sort of thing.  " False text

HE IS A HORRIBLE PERSON. and my prof was like well yeah i hate him but i don’t HATE hate him. and we argued about it. so he took a poll of who hated taylor.

Women get into fewer accidents, get fewer DUIs, and receive fewer speeding tickets than men. “women never shut up” Several scientific studies have shown that not only do men talk more than women, they also think that women have been talking for much longer than they actually have. Men interrupt and talk over women, dominate conversations, and still think women talk too much. “women are shallow” Lol next “my wife is my ball and chain lmao” Multiple studies have shown that marriage between men and women:Increases male lifespan, decreases female lifespanDecreases male depression rates, increases female depression ratesDecreases male stress levels, increases female stress levelsIncreases male health and happiness, decreases female health and happinessIncreases a man’s chance of getting a raise or promotion, decreases a woman’s chances of getting a raise or promotion “women are too emotional” Men love to say this about women after hurting them, in order to shift the blame and dismiss their feelings in one go. In reality, women are taught to hold our tongues and control ourselves quite literally from birth. We’re taught to put men’s needs and wants ahead of our own emotions regardless of the personal cost. Men are taught to do more or less whatever the fuck they want to women. Men take their emotions out on women while women are expected to shove theirs down.

Canned peas and green beans Albacore tuna, red salmon, and fish fillets Bagels, pita bread, English muffins White rice and wild rice Taco shells Almond, rice, goat, and soy milk. Brown eggs and any eggs produced by cage-free or free range chickens, which basically helps corporate chicken farms Several kinds of infant food Anything in bulk Anything organic or natural  here’s the list, for anyone who’s skeptical like i am. it’s on a real-ass government-ass website. i am, tbh, disgusted.  Thanks for the link. That is horrifying and disgusting.  The list is actually worse- no peanuts, SEASONINGS, SOUPS, any canned beans, WHITE RICE, anything organic or natural, and anything like lactose free/kosher milk, or anything that might be necessary to a religious group or someone with conditions such as celiac or lactose intolerance basically have to fill out forms which singles them out based on health/religious reasons.  This is really, really gross.   Is it just me or did they basically rule out basically all the cheapest and easiest to prepare food? Because that is bullshit.   WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK  I have food stamps in a different state and this list is essentially my grocery just when I go to the store. These are easy to prepare, quick, filling meals and most of them have a long shelf life and can be stored for emergencies or of you use up your food stamps before the end of the month. This is absolutely a blatant act of violence against poor families and I hope it continues to gain more national outrage.  Wait. What? How? Why? Huh?  They… They can’t buy potatoes?! Which has more potassium than a banana?! Or nuts?! Which are the best blend of magnesium, calcium, protein, and healthy fats that nature ever made?! I don’t… I don’t understand. There is no way this is concerned with poor people’s nutrition at all.  So what are they allowed to buy on food stamps?  Boiled air?  Interesting fact number one: Wisconsin is a state with a large number of Hmong immigrants, or people of Hmong descent.  I believe that only Minnesota has a larger Hmong population. Interesting fact number two: the first words that come up when I google for “Hmong cuisine” are these: “The Hmong staple food is white rice …”  How the fuck…can you deny the poor…rice and beans. Rice and beans are essential fucking staples for poor people. They can be bought in bulk. They are high in nutrition. They last a long fucking time.  Oh, but wait…THEY DON’T ALLOW POOR PEOPLE TO BUY IN BULK. What is their logic to this? Because all I see here is, “punishing poor people for being poor.” There is NO FUCKING REASON for this. Most of these items cannot remotely be considered ‘luxury.’ To ever deny the poor to buy CANNED or BULKED GOODS is just…mind-blowingly terrible. When I have money, I buy things in bulk for when I don’t…I just…what?!  How the hell do you make it illegal for poor people to buy food? This is so wrong and disgusting.  Given the number of extremely cheap items on the list it looks like a way to discourage people from even using food stamps and either scraping together money for food somehow, or relying on private charities. Is there any single fund or movement to supply food banks in Wisconsin with food specifically from that list in large amounts?    THIS IS BLATANT CLASS WARFARE AND EVERY DECENT HUMAN BEING SHOULD BE DISGUSTED BY IT.

A 17 year old girl in Korea was kicking ass in Overwatch (made it the eighth in the world) and two pro gamers accused her of hacking. So what did she do? Fucking proved them wrong. She demonstrated her skill on a live stream of a popular Korean streamer to show there was no cheating involved.  SHE WAS JUST THAT GOOD It’s sad that she felt she had to wear a mask to hide her identity during the stream because she was afraid she would be targeted for online bullying. She even gets emotional at the end of the stream because this accusation had weighed so heavily on her. The two “pro gamers” even threatened to quit playing if she was proved to be legit, but Blizzard stood behind her and let those two idiots walk away. I may not play Overwatch, but I know if there was a girl who did this in League, CS:GO, or any other online game she would be accused of the same thing. Now I don’t usually post original content, but this is HUGE for online gaming. No one even batted an eye when Rekkles (Fnatic Marksman in LOL) started in the Pro League of Legends scene at 17,but this girl was targeted as a hacker. For Blizzard to stand behind her is an amazing development in the online gaming community and I hope everyone supports her whether they play Overwatch or not.  Good Job Blizzard. And thank you Gegury for being such a strong person and proving those assholes wrong.  The so-called “Pros” indeed quit. And nothing of value was lost. Also love the comments saying “but but but it wasn’t sexism, this happens to dudes!” Nah, man, I’m 90% sure part of what spurred them was the fact that she’s a teenage girl who beat the crap out of them.

The alt-weekly Cleveland Scene’s report revolves around the concept of the “no-bill,” which is the name for a grand jury’s formal decision—arrived at by voting—not to bring charges in a given case. (The opposite of a “no-bill” is a “true bill,” i.e. a decision to indict.) When Cuyahoga County prosecutor Timothy McGinty announced on Dec. 28 that officers Timothy Loehmann and Frank Garmback would not be charged in Rice’s death, he said only that the grand jury “declined to indict” the officers, leading many observers to assume that a no-bill had been voted on. But the Cleveland Scene’s reporters could find no documentation of such a decision, and a spokesman for the Cuyahoga prosecutor’s office responded to the publication’s queries by saying that there had been no vote.  Two area law professors told the Scene they had never heard of a grand jury behaving in such a way. What’s more, reporters were unable to find any official documentation in the Cleveland court system of the grand jury having concluded its business: We were then directed to the Cuyahoga County grand jury office. Wednesday morning, a clerk there told Scene that the “mysterious document” may or may not exist and that, even if it does, it could only be provided to us via court order by Administrative and Presiding Judge John J. Russo … Russo, who spoke to Scene by phone, professed to be as confused as we were. “When you say ‘document,’ I’m not sure what you mean. I don’t know what that is. It’s either a true bill or a no bill,” he said.But actually, no. His staff determined Wednesday that a “no-bill” had never been filed. What any of this means for Rice’s case is unclear. A lawyer representing the Rice family said the lack of a no-bill could constitute another indication that McGinty—who formally recommended against indicting Loehmann and Garmback and presented expert reports to the grand jury that backed up his recommendation—had not taken the idea of prosecution seriously. A federal investigation into Rice’s death is reportedly ongoing; Rice’s family has also filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the officers involved.  Oh hell no  …  so everyone still lies. They are just going to lie. Lie lie lie.  Here’s a link to the Cleveland Scene article. It has an update with an image of the ~document that the Prosecutor’s Office eventually produced. It has the same “declined to issue criminal charges” language, and doesn’t say how this decision was reached. Also, apparently the Grand Jury has to ask for the opportunity to do true bill-no bill vote if they disagree with assessment of the County Prosecutor’s Office on whether there’s sufficient evidence to charge the officer.

They like what he does for people, they like his writing that offers relatable, realistic, flawed, and independent characters both male and female in a sea of terrible YA Fiction that will sexualize girls and tries to teach them that men are the most important things to them - fucking looking at you Twilight.
