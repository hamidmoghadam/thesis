For some reason this is entirely too cute to me so… this happened. Enjoy.(I should be writing for my June project but here I am once again affected by a damn selfie. Why won’t they let me be?)Fic under the cutor[AO3 LINK]They way Dan’s hands are skimming over him relentlessly, Phil knows something is different, he just can’t place what. Maybe it is just being home, finally. Except that he can’t count on familiarity to explain the change in behaviour, because they’ve barely had the chance to get used to the new bed anyway.But there is something insistent still, in the way Dan straddles him and is peering intently. His eyes are wide and unblinking, tracking all over Phil as if he is brand new. “What is it?” He says between kisses, using his extensive experience of Dan, if not yet the bed, to inform his suspicion that something is off.He almost doesn’t want to know. Because there is a hand gripping hard onto his hip and one in his hair and yes, it is familiar and it is just Dan, they are the same practised hands that have done the same time and time again and yet… it is new.Maybe asking will break the spell. But he’s already done it now. “I don’t know,” Dan murmurs into the space between kisses, “You’re different.” And he’s letting fingertips ghost down Phil’s neck, tracing soft meandering circles over Phil’s bare skin and suddenly Phil understands.“It’s the freckles,” he chuckles, “They’re what’s new.”Dan’s fingers halt only for a fraction of a second, but Phil still shudders wonderfully when they start back up again. “It’s not a fetish or something,” Dan assures him, dipping his head to press feathersoft kisses against them, feeling free to do so now it’s been revealed what his particular obsession is this evening. “Just a novelty.” “I understand,” Phil says, raising his own hand to cup Dan’s cheek and swipe a rough thumb over the cluster of speckles dusting his cheekbone. “They’ll fade,” Dan says, “soon.” “Better make the most of it then,” Phil hums, leaning forward to bring his mouth to trace the path his thumb has tracked. Dan lays him out, cataloguing all the places Phil is scattered with the light marks. He runs his fingers and lips over countless of them. Because he isn’t actually counting, he assures Phil, that would be absurd. But Phil swears he can hear the melodic sound of ascending numbers under his breath. They take their time, marking dot-to-dot lines between new patterns of skin to find shapes and symbols there were never there before. Visible only to them, touched and uncovered by only each other. Like archeologists unveiling hidden meaning in random designs. Dan picks up a pen at one point and immortalises his favourites, black lines a harsh contrast against what is still a pale array of stippled skin. They will last, at least until the shower washes it clean later. When he’s finished, if not yet fully satisfied, he lies back and lets Phil do the same to him.Phil is more precise, more exacting in the detail. With fewer to work with he starts first on Dan’s cheekbone. Finding a star and a smile and a swirl. He swears there’s a dog on Dan’s shoulder, but Dan can’t twist his body far enough to see the evidentiary biro mark, but he laughs into Phil’s mouth anyways and tells him he’s sure it’s there.It’s fun and they’re laughing, until they’re panting and gasping. It’s slow and exploratory, reminding them both of those fresh first few times together so long ago. Phil is gentle in the way he was back when he needed to be careful, and Dan is pushy and greedy, demanding and fearful of letting go in a way he’ll swear he never was. It culminates in a shuddering sigh and something familiar. Mind-numbingly good in the ways only someone who knows your body second only to their own can bring. It’s easy and practised as lovers are with each other after so much time, but it feels new, shiney, unexpected. They collapse and curl up together, slotting into well-known patches of skin littered with lesser known patterns of discovered shapes.Everything is different, and yet everything is the same.

Cus I’m not. I’ll just keep doing them  every time I’m tagged!! rules:1. always post the rules.2. answer the questions given by the person who tagged you.3. write 11 questions of your own.4. tag 11 people (or however many you want) [Once again under a cut because I ramble]1. What’s your favourite non-domesticated animal?Otters. Though I hear Ed Sheeran has a pet one so maybe they can be domesticated? I’ll keep hoping*2. Do you have any hobby or something you really really like to do?Writing fanfic is pretty much my hobby but I also knit and crochet and bake and am teaching myself piano again (I used to play when I was a kid)3. If you could travel to any place in the world, where would you travel and why? I’ve never been to Australia and I think I would like to go. But I’ve mostly a homebody tbh.4. Do you have a song that means a lot to you? Why?I have many that have meant a lot to me at various point in my life. At the moment I am relating hard to ‘When’ by dodie. But if anyone really wants to know what songs speak to me as a person I can share them. I have a playlist.5. What inspires you?Talking to other writers/creators/artists and people who are really passionate about what they do whatever it is. There is nothing more inspiring about someone talking passionately about something important to them.6. What makes you feel calm? There’s an specific sound, smell, view, touch or taste that helps you when you’re nervous?Rain. In a moving car. At night.Also spoken word/audio books - It doesn’t really matter what the book is but I find people reading long things really calming and I fall asleep to people talking most nights. (Also works with gaming videos as they’re just talking over the top of games. Not dnp though. Tried it. Woke up to Dan screaming WAY too often).7. What are your goals?I have a bucket list of things I want to accomplish by the time I’m 30 (next year) which I am slowly working through.8. Do you like plants or flowers? You have a favourite one?I like Dahlias and Orchids if I had to pick but I’m not a massive flower person tbh.9. What’s your favourite movie genre?Musicals - Old ones, new ones, shit ones good ones, if its got a musical number, I’ll watch it. (As a side note there is a difference between a musical movie and a movie with music. The musical numbers have to move the story forward. More points if the characters don’t know they’re singing. Which is why Glee doesn’t count. Still watched it though.)10. What is your biggest fear?Silence. I hate silent rooms because I have anxiety and silence makes my brain run on and on and on. I can’t concentrate on a task at hand in silence either. I have to have music/spoken voices/audio books in the background. For my daily updates on background listening please follow my Twitter lol. 11. If you had to describe yourself with a colour, which one would it be?Yellow. It’s not many people’s favourite, no one wants it around all the time but it’s pleasant in small doses. (It is my favourite colour though.)I’m not going to tag anyone as this is the fourth time I’ve done this and I’m sure my lovely followers don’t want me bugging them every other day. However, if you see this consider yourself tagged if you’d like to be. Seriously, you can say I tagged you. " True text
