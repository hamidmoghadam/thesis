They finished each others sentences, interjected constantly, echoed important points in reverence/understanding/agreement and relied on each other to complete the communication of a thought or a concept to someone outside their circle.   So like, instead of one of them explaining something, they would all add fragments to form a complete thought.____  The Vuvalini: What’s there to find at the Citadel? Max: Green. Toast: And water. There’s a ridiculous amount of clear water. And a lot of crops. The Dag: It’s got everything you need, as long as you’re not afraid of heights. Keeper of the Seeds: Where does the water come from? Toast: [regarding Immortan Joe] He pumps it up from deep within the earth. He calls it “Aqua Cola” and claims it all for himself. The Dag: And because he owns it, he owns all of us.  _____  Capable: We are not things!Cheedo: No!The Dag: Cheedo, we are not things!Capable: We are not things.Cheedo: I don’t want to hear that again!Capable: They were her words.Cheedo: And now she’s dead!The Dag: Wring your hands and tear your hair, but you’re not going back. You’re not going back to him.  ___Interestingly, the Vuvalini do this as well.    Everyone else in the movie (including furiosa!) speaks in short definitive statements or exclamations that cannot be piled upon or interrupted. So this was definitely done on purpose.    its very cool.  I wonder if this is just a thing in english/western culture or if other groups of women speak to each other like this?    also theirs a bunch of people in the notes fighting about “I HATE GETTING INTERRUPTED” This isn’t so much a classic “interruption”.  like when someone talks over you to change the subject or say something unrelated or better than what you’re saying and stealing the attention from you,etc. Its more like the person doing the interruption is expecting you not to really stop talking, or expects you to finish your thought, and is only interrupting to agree/ interject a footnote that is contributory, but not distracting. So it would look like.Woman 1 and 2 telling a story to woman 3: Woman 1 “We sat down and he brought out this really good green tea-Woman 2: –but it was the powder kind of green tea not the bag kind–Woman1: –yeah and he brought out these really cool whisks and let us do it ourselves–Woman 2: and Woman 1 frothed hers so much she had nothing left!Woman 3: omg did you like it? was it good?Woman 1 and 2 in unison: Yes! Woman 1: We should go again together sometime.Woman 2- yeah I think you’d really like it too!  See how Woman 1 is the alpha speaker (the person telling the story) and Woman 2 is the…. hype man? for lack of a better word. Every sentence that Woman 1 says is the story, and woman 2 is adding smaller clarification related details. And when she adds a dynamic detail  “had nothing left!” it is an excited interjection that continues the story, without taking ownership of the topic. Woman 3 will walk away from this conversation feeling that Woman 1 was the expert on this situation, but that Woman 2 had a particularly exciting time.  there was a study on this precisely that I read about, though I’ll need my pc to retrieve it. It was about how women tendentially see conversation as collaborative while men tendentially treat it as competitive, thus women usually interrupt to agree/interject to encourage, while men more often interrupt to talk over and/or demonstrate superior knowledge on a topic.  The study was probably Deborah Tannen, she found that women use more of what she called overlapping speech, such as “yup”, “right”, etc. and men are more likely to change the subject. In either the same study or a similar study she found that in the case where someone such as a friend talks about a problem or negative experience or feeling, women are more likely to respond with emotional support and understanding, whereas men are more likely to try to offer practical advice, and this can lead to misunderstandings.

People who kept their comforters into adulthood were less likely to smoke, drink or do drugs, tended to have better family relations and home lives etc, while those that saw their comforter removed or destroyed were more likely to be drawn to more serious “comforts” elsewhere. The more extreme the removal, the more extreme the result. Typically. We learn at our own pace to make and break connections and emotional ties, and the situation is forced upon us, we seek comfort. But whoa wait, you can’t possibly have comfort anymore, you’re five. You’re a big kid now.  So when parents are forcing you to “grow up” by tearing the only comfort in the world from you, they could actually be messing you up big time.  In psychology they’re called “transitional objects” and they help the neurobiological process of helping children learn to internalize the experience of being loved and cared for, which is an essential part of learning to regulate your emotions.  They are REALLY important.  I wonder what it means psychologically that I’ve started getting a few more for myself?  Well, there’s a process we call “re-parenting yourself” where you give yourself the love you missed out on in childhood, and thereby start to heal the pain you’ve carried since then.  And using childhood comfort objects can be part of that.

Her story is sadly reminiscent of Mary Spears’, who was killed in similar circumstances in 2014. Every few months stories like these make it into the news cycle, even though related harassment and assaults are happening every day in the US and elsewhere.  When stories do surface, people express surprise, sadness and outrage, all of which seem to dissipates in a heartbeat. If there is more prolonged criticism, it often falls along racist, ethnic, nationalist, classist lines, despite the far greater prevalence of attacks on women by men in their own peer groups Women can and do say no, sometimes successfully and in ways that are empowering. When we do, people applaud us, cheer us on, make videos that go viral. But, every single time we do so at great risk.   No, taking naked pictures doesn’t mean I consent to sharing them. No, I don’t want to perform oral sex on a stranger. No, I don’t want to be married to you anymore. No, what I wear doesn’t give you rights to sex. No, I don’t want to send you naked pictures. No, I don’t want to see your naked picture. No, I don’t want to see you anymore. No, I don’t want to get back together. No, drinking doesn’t mean I consent. No, I won’t go to the prom with you. No, you cannot share that picture. No, I don’t want you to touch me. No, I don’t want to live with you. No, I don’t want to have a drink. No, you’re abusing your power. No, I don’t want to talk to you. No, I want to keep this baby. No, I don’t want to date you. No, I want to go to school. No, I don’t want to smile. No, I disagree with you. No, I want an abortion. No, I don’t need a ride. No, I want a divorce. No, I don’t think so. No, I will not fight. No, I will not stop. No, I’m not going. No, I won’t. No, stop. Street harassment doesn’t happen in a vacuum. Women everywhere, whether consciously or not, have to be vigilant about a broad spectrum of violence: street harassment, sexual assault, stalking, and both stranger and intimate partner assault.  One in three American woman has experienced domestic violence. One in six is stalked.  An American woman’s chance of being sexually assaulted is one in five, one in three if she is Native American. Women. Can’t. Say. No. “Just tell him to you aren’t interested?” is a sorry and entitled display of really not caring what happens to the person you are talking to. The list above is long, but edited down. How many women have to die because they say “no” before this is taken seriously as a matter of public health and women’s rights? I’m saddened by Janese Talton-Jackson’s brutal killing. But I am enraged that attacks like this happen all the time and we continue to ignore the connective tissue. Last month, a man, angry that a woman had rebuffed him earlier in the night, knocked down the front door of her apartment and, when he found she wasn’t home, grabbed her three month old puppy and threw it out of a third floor window. Last week, a man was sentenced to two years in jail for attacking his spouse with a hammer. Another was arrested for attacking his girlfriend as she tried to attempt leaving him. And yet a third was arrested after killing his wife for wanting divorce. This week, police in Florida are trying to locate a man who has been serially harassing women real estate agents while they work. In some countries, the most violent attacks against girls and women involve acid throwing, in others, like ours, its more likely to involve setting a woman on fire, ashappened in Pomona, California on Christmas Day. If it had happened in, say, India, chances are you would have heard about it. That might sound like an outlier, until you begin to look and see similar cases in Maryland,  Florida, Ohio, Michigan, Missouri,Oregon.  Clearly all these women weren’t subservient enough and just as clearly, no mainstream media outlet is keeping track.  Damon Young writes about this from his perspective as a man and a father, here.   male entitlement leads to violence. this is scary and sad, and happens every day. " False text

There’s a very good reason free-runners dive and roll.  Hand-to-hand fights usually only last a matter of seconds, sometimes a few minutes. It’s exhausting work and unless you have a lot of training and history with hand-to-hand combat, you’re going to tire out really fast.  Arrows are very effective and you can’t just yank them out without doing a lot of damage. Most of the time the head of the arrow will break off inside the body if you try pulling it out, and arrows are built to pierce deep. An arrow wound demands medical attention.  Throwing your opponent across the room is really not all that smart. You’re giving them the chance to get up and run away. Unless you’re trying to put distance between you so you can shoot them or something, don’t throw them.  Everyone has something called a “flinch response” when they fight. This is pretty much the brain’s way of telling you “get the fuck out of here or we’re gonna die.” Experienced fighters have trained to suppress this. Think about how long your character has been fighting. A character in a fist fight for the first time is going to take a few hits before their survival instinct kicks in and they start hitting back. A character in a fist fight for the eighth time that week is going to respond a little differently.  ADRENALINE WORKS AGAINST YOU WHEN YOU FIGHT. THIS IS IMPORTANT. A lot of times people think that adrenaline will kick in and give you some badass fighting skills, but it’s actually the opposite. Adrenaline is what tires you out in a battle and it also affects the fighter’s efficacy - meaning it makes them shaky and inaccurate, and overall they lose about 60% of their fighting skill because their brain is focusing on not dying. Adrenaline keeps you alive, it doesn’t give you the skill to pull off a perfect roundhouse kick to the opponent’s face.  Swords WILL bend or break if you hit something hard enough. They also dull easily and take a lot of maintenance. In reality, someone who fights with a sword would have to have to repair or replace it constantly. Fights get messy. There’s blood and sweat everywhere, and that will make it hard to hold your weapon or get a good grip on someone.  A serious battle also smells horrible. There’s lots of sweat, but also the smell of urine and feces. After someone dies, their bowels and bladder empty. There might also be some questionable things on the ground which can be very psychologically traumatizing. Remember to think about all of the character’s senses when they’re in a fight. Everything WILL affect them in some way. If your sword is sharpened down to a fine edge, the rest of the blade can’t go through the cut you make. You’ll just end up putting a tiny, shallow scratch in the surface of whatever you strike, and you could probably break your sword.  ARCHERS ARE STRONG TOO. Have you ever drawn a bow? It takes a lot of strength, especially when you’re shooting a bow with a higher draw weight. Draw weight basically means “the amount of force you have to use to pull this sucker back enough to fire it.” To give you an idea of how that works, here’s a helpful link to tell you about finding bow sizes and draw weights for your characters.  (CLICK ME) If an archer has to use a bow they’re not used to, it will probably throw them off a little until they’ve done a few practice shots with it and figured out its draw weight and stability. People bleed. If they get punched in the face, they’ll probably get a bloody nose. If they get stabbed or cut somehow, they’ll bleed accordingly. And if they’ve been fighting for a while, they’ve got a LOT of blood rushing around to provide them with oxygen. They’re going to bleed a lot.  Here’s a link to a chart to show you how much blood a person can lose without dying. (CLICK ME)  If you want a more in-depth medical chart, try this one. (CLICK ME) Hopefully this helps someone out there. If you reblog, feel free to add more tips for writers or correct anything I’ve gotten wrong here.      How to apply Writing techniques for action scenes:  - Short sentences. Choppy. One action, then another. When there’s a lull in the fight, take a moment, using longer phrases to analyze the situation–then dive back in. Snap, snap, snap. - Same thing with words - short, simple, and strong in the thick of battle. Save the longer syllables for elsewhere.  - Characters do not dwell on things when they are in the heat of the moment. They will get punched in the face. Focus on actions, not thoughts. - Go back and cut out as many adverbs as possible. - No seriously, if there’s ever a time to use the strongest verbs in your vocabulary - Bellow, thrash, heave, shriek, snarl, splinter, bolt, hurtle, crumble, shatter, charge, raze - it’s now. - Don’t forget your other senses. People might not even be sure what they saw during a fight, but they always know how they felt. - Taste: Dry mouth, salt from sweat, copper tang from blood, etc- Smell: OP nailed it- Touch: Headache, sore muscles, tense muscles, exhaustion, blood pounding. Bruised knuckles/bowstring fingers. Injuries that ache and pulse, sting and flare white hot with pain. - Pain will stay with a character. Even if it’s minor. - Sound and sight might blur or sharpen depending on the character and their experience/exhaustion. Colors and quick movements will catch the eye. Loud sounds or noises from behind may serve as a fighter’s only alert before an attack. - If something unexpected happens, shifting the character’s whole attention to that thing will shift the Audience’s attention, too. - Aftermath. This is where the details resurface, the characters pick up things they cast aside during the fight, both literally and metaphorically. Fights are chaotic, fast paced, and self-centered. Characters know only their self, their goals, what’s in their way, and the quickest way around those threats. The aftermath is when people can regain their emotions, their relationships, their rationality/introspection, and anything else they couldn’t afford to think or feel while their lives were on the line.  Do everything you can to keep the fight here and now. Maximize the physical, minimize the theoretical. Keep things immediate - no theories or what ifs.  If writing a strategist, who needs to think ahead, try this: keep strategy to before-and-after fights. Lay out plans in calm periods, try to guess what enemies are thinking or what they will do. During combat, however, the character should think about his options, enemies, and terrain in immediate terms; that is, in shapes and direction.  (Large enemy rushing me; dive left, circle around / Scaffolding on fire, pool below me / two foes helping each other, separate them.) Lastly, after writing, read it aloud. Anyplace your tongue catches up on a fast moving scene, edit. Smooth action scenes rarely come on the first try.  " False text

And the American members get a free pass because they are friends with “foreigners” apparently Gimp is the name of a free art application run by volunteers. I’ve gotten a lot of use out of it and I have a lot of respect for projects like these that run on the support people can actually provide and not one set dollar amount. The name is offensive. The name was chosen because they thought it would be funnier that way and the last few days whoever runs their twitter, and other volunteers, have been completely out of line when multiple disabled people tweeted them to ask for a name change. “Gimp” is continually questioned about their name and at this point are far past pretending to be professional The justification they give for using the word gimp is that this is an acronym for their program so it’s completely coincidental Even though they’ve already admitted they did it as a joke and the actual acronym for GNU Image Manipulation Program is GNUIMP. GNU is an operating system which is its own acronym. Handpicking letters to create a brand name that is also a slur is not how acronyms work. Logically their name should have been IMP which seems like it would work just fine because it also is an actual word and thus easy to remember. And they’ve already admitted to using gimp because they found it funny In case you don’t know, gimp is a derogatory term for someone who is physically disabled or an otherwise “contemptible” person. And I know the argument of “no one actually calls disabled people that anymore” is coming and once again you would be incorrect in thinking that. As someone who has spent their entire life physically disabled I can tell you it’s quite common and usually used during a hate crime. The word is also still professionally used in the medical field despite our best efforts to end that. Whoever is running the Gimp twitter account has gone beyond being a troll, some of the highlights include: Take notice of how few notes everything has. No one cares and the company has been behaving like this for so long they have given up justifying anything and have just started mocking people Shout out to @Scereyaha, their responses were articulate and on point, all my replies were just backing them up which is fine because it shows that some of us still care, some of us haven’t just given up because we know there will be no accountability for things like this in our lifetime but if we want it for someone else’s lifetime we have to work now Please tweet @GIMP_Official and say something as simple as “refusing to change your name is unacceptable” or “stop talking over disabled people” Anything Those of you who proclaim to be allies of disabled people or those of you who have been asking what you should do to be an appropriate ally, this is what we need. We need your privilege in situations like this to prop up our voices. Please signal boost, especially able-bodied and neurologically typical people. Please actually do something as an ally, it’s just a simple tweet and I already hear the excuse of “I don’t have an account” but people make accounts to do nothing more than complement celebrities, it’s not hard and complaining about having to actually “do” something that is so effortless honestly makes you worse than these people at gimp. They may be fighting against us but at least they are fighting. Use your privilege, signal boost. " False text

This isn’t having a short attention span (or well maybe thats part of it), but probably something called “Optimal Arousal.”(This is psychology, not anatomy, please keep your mind out of the gutter Xp) Optimal Arousal goes like this: When effort is low, more stimulus is better. When effort is high, less stimulus is better.  I’ll elaborate. Whenever you do something easy (like maybe some homework as an example), unless something else is happening (like music or a show) you tend to get drawn away or doze off. In this homework scenario, the effort is low, so in order to keep at it and do well on working on it, you need a higher amount of stimulus, like a movie. If something is hard, like for instance a test, you probably will try to avoid noise, going so far as to hush others so you can concentrate. The effort is high so you want less stimulus. Keep this in mind. It can help you focus, and make life a lot easier. Dont feel bad for doing lots of different things while you are just chillin. Enjoy the knowledge!  ALSO: if you have ADHD or other ‘attention’ disorders, not only is your window of Optimal Arousal, smaller it also varies more from task to task and day to day! Some days, I have to have buckets of additional stimuli to get anything done- like having a movie playing and reading a book while cooking- and other days I can’t have ANY additional stimuli or remembering to breathe regularly is hard. So, know yourself, know what you need and go ahead and modify your surroundings as you need so that you’re comfortable. " False text

They’re all wonderful reviews, so I can’t feel too bad about that, but I’m kinda hoping we can get more up there before the trade paperback edition and the third book are listed, she said wistfully… (Goodreads has 73 reviews up, also predominantly good. I’ve love to see that hit 100) Why is this important? Well, obviously, for my own egoboo. Never underestimate the kick in the pants a good review can give a writer to get back to writing (“they liked it! They might want more!”). It’s like a very public fan letter (I like the private ones too, yes). But even more than that, and more directly useful than that, reviews (and ideally positive reviews) are the best, most effective marketing took anything ever gets. It’s not me you’re reviewing for, it’s the person browsing for their next book to buy. Lots of people saying “oh hey I liked this” is far more likely to push a sale, or at least get them to take a look at the book…. And the more we sell, the more I get to write, the better I can afford to do things like feed the cats and house myself, without becoming a burden on society and/or ending up living in my bestie’s basement… (mind you, it’s a very nice basement, and comes with hot and cold running dogs, but still.)

Not only because she’s his mother, but because that’s how Voldemort was defeated the first time around, and Voldemort cannot change or learn. 1980′s Voldemort was defeated because of a mother’s love, Lily’s sacrifice for Harry.  Lily was not considered important to Voldemort, only James and Harry were. Voldemort was even willing to spare her for Snape, if she didn’t put up a fight (which of course she did). To him, Lily was irrelevant, because she was a woman and Muggle-born. Voldemort underestimated her, and it cost him. So naturally he would do the same thing again in the 90′s, focusing on Harry and the prophecy, never considering the thing that defeated him before might do so again. He was wary of Lucius and Draco, but underestimated Narcissa and it lead directly to his defeat. And she KNEW he did, and used it to her advantage. This short-sightedness is even reflected in his most ardent supporter Bellatrix, who was also killed by a furious mother protecting her child.  A mother’s love started the series, and a mother’s love ended it. " False text

Child abuse in Japan While no link has been made between anime, manga and child abuse, Japan is facing a “serious” child abuse problem, according to a White Paper issued by the National Police Agency in March. The paper said the number of child abuse victims jumped 20% between 2011 and 2012, and the number of victims, arrests and cases are at their highest levels since they started compiling statistics in 1999. At the same time, the number of cleared child pornography crime cases rose to 1,596, the highest ever recorded, the paper said. Most – 85% – were Internet-related. The figures inspired the U.S. State Department to label Japan as an “international hub” for producing and trafficking child pornography. The U.S. report noted that no national law addresses the “unfettered availability of sexual explicit cartoons, comics and video games, some of which depicted scenes of violent sexual abuse and the rape of children. It added: ‘While the NPA continued to maintain that no link was established between these animated images and child victimization, other experts suggested children are harmed by a culture that appears to accept child sexual abuse.”  #gee who woulda thought that depicting children in sexual situations would lead to it occurring more in real life This needs to be fucking slam-dunked in the faces of every single abhorrent and disgusting pedophile and/or pedo-apologist that wants to cry and whine about how fictitious child pornography doesn’t contribute to nor perpetuate CSA just as real footage or photographs of children does; those disgusting clods who insist that fictitious depictions of children in sexual situations doesn’t somehow normalize the idea that sexualizing  children is okay, and that it doesn’t ~actually~ harm anyone… as if this form of child pornography exists in a vacuum. Lolicon and Shotacon are child pornography.  They hurt children in Japan, and most likely children in other various places world-wide where this type of child pornography spreads.  Why?  Because child pornography is child pornography, plain and simple, and every last bit of it is toxic and harmful… and this particular variety only makes it easier for pedophiles to victimize children due to its “appealing” style, so don’t you dare ever say that it’s somehow more acceptable for child pornography to exist and that it’s somehow not harmful - all because it’s DRAWN.

Emphasis is mine.  For the first time, I understood that I, too, have been and am being judged by the color of my skin.  For far too long, I have been judged by the color of my skin rather than by the content of my character—because the color of my skin has passed for the content of my character.  In innumerable settings and circumstances, in ways small and large, I have been assumed to be trustworthy and good simply because I am white.  I have been deemed a nice person, just by showing up in my skin.  and  The social ease one experiences as a white person can reinforce the idea that the world is generally a friendly place that rewards good people.  When people of color tell us over and over that they do not experience this same smoothness, we assume it has to do with them—for how can a world so soft on us be so hard on others?  We assume their struggle has to do with their poor character, not ours.  We assume the dissonance they experience has little to do with the color of their skin, just as our congruence has little to do with ours.  A comfortable beneficiary of this state of affairs, I have been unable or unwilling to see what was right before my pale face—how deeply my color has formed my character.  My free movement, my easy access, my ample opportunities, my open interactions have tricked me into confusing societal privilege for personal virtues.  The gig is up: it’s been the color of my skin all along.  The best part of the article is the section about white people’s propensity toward ‘tender sorrow’ in the face of racism, and how that bland reaction does absolutely nothing to bring justice to our world.  That we have pained ourselves to endure uncomfortable feelings, even for a moment, we take as a sign of character.  The problem is not tender feelings—it is that they are stillborn.  They never mature into adulthood, into focused study or action, into sustained introspection, into serious connection with communities of color.  We must disabuse ourselves of the notion that our feelings of “concern,” no matter how sincere, carry moral heft.    When whites do emerge from what James Baldwin so aptly calls “emotional kindergarten,” it is usually through substantive engagement with non-white others and the struggle for justice.  Exemplars of character who are white (say, a Dorothy Day or Daniel Berrigan) develop courage and virtue in and with communities of struggle and resistance.  Prioritizing relationships with persons on the margins, they engage long, committed journeys out of moral inertia, ease, and denial.  In other words, they develop courage and virtue despite, not because of, their whiteness.

We have entered a phase of regression,and one of the easiest ways to see it is in our infrastructure: our roads and bridges look more like those in Thailand or Venezuela than the Netherlands or Japan. But it goes far deeper than that, which is why Temin uses a famous economic model created to understand developing nations to describe how far inequality has progressed in the United States. The model is the work of West Indian economist W. Arthur Lewis, the only person of African descent to win a Nobel Prize in economics.  In the Lewis model of a dual economy, much of the low-wage sector has little influence over public policy. Check.  The high-income sector will keep wages down in the other sector to provide cheap labor for its businesses. Check.  Social control is used to keep the low-wage sector from challenging the policies favored by the high-income sector. Mass incarceration - check.  The primary goal of the richest members of the high-income sector is to lower taxes. Check.  Social and economic mobility is low. Check. Temin says that today in the U.S., the ticket out is education, which is difficult for two reasons: you have to spend money over a long period of time, and the FTE sector is making those expenditures more and more costly by defunding public schools and making policies that increase student debt burdens.   Even with a diploma, you will likely find that high-paying jobs come from networks of peers and relatives. Social capital, as well as economic capital, is critical, but because of America’s long history of racism and the obstacles it has created for accumulating both kinds of capital, black graduates often can only find jobs in education, social work, and government instead of higher-paying professional jobs like technology or finance— something most white people are not really aware of. Women are also held back by a long history of sexism and the burdens — made increasingly heavy — of making greater contributions to the unpaid care economy and lack of access to crucial healthcare. How did we get this way? What happened to America’s middle class, which rose triumphantly in the post-World War II years, buoyed by the GI bill, the victories of labor unions, and programs that gave the great mass of workers and their families health and pension benefits that provided security? Around 1970, the productivity of workers began to get divided from their wages. Corporate attorney and later Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell galvanized the business community to lobby vigorously for its interests. Johnson’s War on Poverty was replaced by Nixon’s War on Drugs, which sectioned off many members of the low-wage sector, disproportionately black, into prisons. Politicians increasingly influenced by the FTE sector turned from public-spirited universalism to free-market individualism. As money-driven politics accelerated (a phenomenon explained by the Investment Theory of Politics, as Temin explains), leaders of the FTE sector became increasingly emboldened to ignore the needs of members of the low-wage sector, or even to actively work against them.  Temin notes that “the desire to preserve the inferior status of blacks has motivated policies against all members of the low-wage sector.” What can we do? We’ve been digging ourselves into a hole for over forty years, but Temin says that we know how to stop digging.  If we spent more on domestic rather than military activities, then the middle class would not vanish as quickly.  The effects of technological change and globalization could be altered by political actions.  We could restore and expand education, shifting resources from policies like mass incarceration to improving the human and social capital of all Americans.  We could upgrade infrastructure, forgive mortgage and educational debt in the low-wage sector,  reject the notion that private entities should replace democratic government in directing society, and  focus on embracing an integrated American population.  We could tax not only the income of the rich, but also their capital.   We have a structure that predetermines winners and losers. We are not getting the benefits of all the people who could contribute to the growth of the economy, to advances in medicine or science which could improve the quality of life for everyone — including some of the rich people.” Along with Thomas Piketty, whose Capital in the Twenty-First Century examines historical and modern inequality, Temin’s book has provided a giant red flag, illustrating a trajectory that will continue to accelerate as long as the 20 percent in the FTE sector are permitted to operate a country within America’s borders solely for themselves at the expense of the majority.  Without a robust middle class, America is not only reverting to developing-country status, it is increasingly ripe for serious social turmoil that has not been seen in generations.

This carpet bombing, which included 32,000 tons of napalm, often deliberately targeted civilian as well as military targets, devastating the country far beyond what was necessary to fight the war. Whole cities were destroyed, with many thousands of innocent civilians killed and many more left homeless and hungry. For Americans, the journalist Blaine Harden has written, this bombing was “perhaps the most forgotten part of a forgotten war,” even though it was almost certainly “a major war crime.” Yet it shows that North Korea’s hatred of America “is not all manufactured,” he wrote. “It is rooted in a fact-based narrative, one that North Korea obsessively remembers and the United States blithely forgets.” " False link

On virtually every issue, he often seems to be driven by his ego more than an overall strategy.  Yale historian Timothy Snyder thinks he has a pretty good idea of what Trump is aiming for: regime change in the US. “The moment you say it couldn’t happen here, is the moment you are ignoring history.” Timothy Snyder In other words, Snyder believes Trump wants to fundamentally change the system of government in the US, moving the country toward authoritarianism.  The Housum Professor of History at Yale University explains his theory to Radio Open Source, Our problem is that we are exceptionalists. We all think we live beyond history because we assume our reality is unchangeable. We have someone in office who has never said anything about how he supports democracy — on the contrary, he said if it doesn’t go his way he wouldn’t respect its results.  We have a president who has never said anything about how he respects the rule of law — on the contrary, his entire career is challenging the law. In Snyder’s view, Americans shouldn’t be fooled into believing authoritarianism can’t take hold in the US. He believes we need to look out for various warning signs from Trump.  In a recent article for Time, Snyder writes, A basic weapon of regime changers, as fascists realized nearly a century ago, is to destroy the concept of truth. Democracy requires the rule of law, the rule of law depends upon trust and trust depends upon citizens’ acceptance of factuality.  The president and his aides actively seek to destroy Americans’ sense of reality. Not only does the White House spread ‘alternative facts,’ but Kellyanne Conway openly proclaims this as right and good. Post-factuality is pre-fascism. He continues, The prospect of children and grandchildren growing up under tyranny is terrifyingly real. History can remind us of the fragile fundaments of our own democracy, but what follows now is up to us.  Snyder — who also researched the formulation of Nazi Germany — thinks we should be concerned about the president’s tendency to express admiration for various authoritarians. The historian has a point, especially when looking at Trump’s behavior toward world leaders accused of numerous human rights abuses.Snyder believes the US has about a year to defend American democracy, which is roughly the same amount of time it took Hitler to bring about regime change in Germany: It took Hitler one year in 1933, that’s how long it took the Poles in the current world to get rid of their supreme court. Hungary took two years. While some might be tempted to dismiss Snyder as an alarmist and his theory about Trump as extreme, there’s plenty of evidence to support his arguments — and that’s not a good thing.  I absolutely believe this, and if that means in a year or two people laugh at me, I would take that as a good sign.Look at Venezuela. Look at Turkey. Look at Nazi Germany. Look at ANY point in history when authoritarian regimes took hold. Look at them, and FIGHT." False link

You can be female because you have an X and a Y chromosome but your Y is missing the SRY gene, and so you have a female body. You can be male because you have two X chromosomes, but one of your X’s HAS an SRY gene, and so you have a male body. You can be male because you have two X chromosomes- but also a Y. You can be female because you have only one X chromosome at all. And you can be male because you have two X chromosomes, but your heart and brain are male. And vice - effing - versa. Don’t use science to justify your bigotry. The world is way too weird for that shit.   Addressing this to the TERF that assaulted me. " False link

A handful of other European countries have also removed their forced sterilization laws in the past few years.“Today is a victory for trans people and human rights in Europe,” said Transgender Europe Executive Director Julia Ehrt in a press release. “This decision ends the dark chapter of state-induced sterilization in Europe.”OutRight Action International Executive Director Jessica Stern also applauded the ruling.“Today the world moved in the right direction for trans rights everywhere,” she said. “Forcing unnecessary medical interventions to access basic human rights like legal recognition of a person’s gender is barbaric.”The European Court of Human Rights ruling said forced medical examinations or mental health diagnoses for trans people do not violate the European Convention on Human Rights.“It is regrettable that cruel and unnecessary medical examinations are seen to be in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights,” said Transgender Europe Senior Policy Officer Richard Köhler. “We will continue to raise awareness about the human rights abuses in the medical field that trans people are still systematically subjected to.”This is a really big deal, and about damn time, too. " False link

Larry Hogan that changes the state’s legal definition of rape.The bill, which was proposed in response to a BuzzFeed News investigation, makes clear that an incident can be characterized as rape even if victims don’t use force to resist their assailants.“Sexual assault survivors will no longer be forced to choose between keeping safe or having access to justice,” said Lisae Jordan, executive director of the Maryland Coalition Against Sexual Assault. “‘No’ will mean ‘no’ and the law will back them up.”Last September, BuzzFeed News reported that one of the state’s largest law enforcement agencies, the Baltimore County Police Department, often labeled rape allegations as “unfounded” without doing basic detective work. One reason was Maryland’s rape law, which required not only a lack of consent on the part of the victim, but also “force or the threat of force” by the assailant.Police interpreted that law to mean victims needed to fight back: “Saying no is not enough to support a rape charge,“ a Baltimore County Police spokeswoman told BuzzFeed News."

The bull had a specific meaning when it was made, but it was foolish to think that that meanings would remain static over time. The times changed, the meaning of the bull changed. And frankly, if he wanted a symbol that represented peace and freedom, and -all- Americans, he really fucked up in his choice. Long before his sculpture, the bull has been associated with masculinity, violence and rape. Maybe he needed to think more carefully about what symbol he was using. But y'know. Male artist. What does he care what a bull might say in a gendered environment? What he’s having a hissy fit about now is not even so much someone changing the meaning of his art, but pointing out THE FLAW IT ALWAYS HAD in not being a very universal symbol. But I guess it’s easier to claim that someone else is changing the meaning of your work to make it sexist, rather than admitting you fucked up.  As a fellow artist, he’s a total fool for thinking he can control the reception of his work. Yes, it sucks for him that it now has a negative meaning, but let’s be honest: it had that before Fearless Girl was installed, and there IS a gross hypocrisy in a man who installed a statue without permission, without caring about how it would interact with the environment around it, now wanting another piece of art removed because he doesn’t like it and no one asked him first.  Secondly, it’s bogus to claim that it’s wrong or problematic for Fearless Girl derives it’s meaning and power only from the bull: it’s called site-specific, and the bull is site-specific too. It’s not a point against FG that it’s a piece that interacts with its environment and another piece of art in it - all art does, whether the artist intends it or not. No art exists in isolation, it all responds to other pieces. Would the bull be anything other than a bull anywhere else? But apparently that’s not a question we should consider for the bull, just for FG. And the fact that the author can’t think of any other context in which the girl would still be “fearless” really shows his bias. Stick her in front of the White House, Trump Tower or Mar-A-Lago and tell me she doesn’t still deserve the title “fearless”.  So all of those arguments against the FG fall down as soon as you remove the bogus premise that the meaning of a piece of art is static and frozen at the moment of its creation.  Thirdly: I really don’t care all that much that it’s sponsored. We criticise companies for not supporting the arts, and then criticise them when they do. Whilst in an ideal world I’d like them all to support the arts, and be free from bigotry and be 100% ethical and socially responsible, realistically I’m not going to demand that artists only take money from companies who are spotless: especially if the artist is going to use the money to address social issues in the world. The fact that a company commissioned the piece doesn’t make that company magically immune from the criticism the piece represents (and might actually make them particularly vulnerable to it).  Is the fact that it uses “SHE” rather than “she” interesting? Yes. Is it problematic? Perhaps. Frankly, most people -don’t- remember who sponsored the piece, or care or know what SHE is, and secondly, the capitalisation of the word doesn’t magically rule out the meaning of “her”. (And er, SHE is a gender diversity tracking index, why does the author think they picked that specific acronym???). Frankly, the fact that the author of the piece keeps trying to strip the meaning from the word ‘she’ by referring to it only as a logo is way more problematic, imo.  Also, praising an artist for being so subversive and guerrilla and not capitalist when he apparently had the money and means to invest in all the material to make the bull himself, and have it installed, and has happily let it be a symbol of Wall Street for years, despite its toxic masculinity, despite the massive corruption and the recent financial crisis that fucked over so many people, but especially those marginalised art people subversive art is supposed to represent… idk, i think he needs to find himself a new hero to idolise. But hey, male artist defending male artist. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ " False link
