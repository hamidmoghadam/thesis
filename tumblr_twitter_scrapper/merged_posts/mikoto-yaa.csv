The thing is I love to spend time on the internet and laugh at memes, occasionally cry over fictional characters and do art because it’s some sort of stress relief and also super fun to me. Of course I’m no professional. And it’s fine if people know that.The thing about taking commissions is that I’m super grateful to people who actually wanna buy a piece of art. From me. So I want to give them back the best thing possible and suddenly my expectation level rises and my inner perfectionist stresses me out. Usually I draw like  “well, whatever, if I mess up and it still looks good, I can live with it haha”. It’s different about commissions. Idk if it sounds ridiculous to some of you but that’s how I feel about it.I hope you can sort of understand that I have a certain level of anxiety regarding this matter. I’m way too serious about it even though I’m quite an easygoing and laid back individual. Yeah that’s quite it. But I want to gain experience and do it. Discover new lands haha. Jk, but i guess i made my point clear. If not, my inbox is free to spam. " True text

Day.   This is an effort to get everyone hyped up about KHR again - a wonderful anime that seriously needs more love.   On that day, we’ll just be adding some extra things - and really just invite everyone to show up and show their love for the amazing characters in it.  Send in something about KHR - whether it’s headcanons, fanfictions, or art that you want to share or talk about.   Tags being used will be “Reborn! Day,” “KHR Day” and “R!0311″ - though definitely go to the individual blogs and see which ones they’ll be using in particular to make sure you can find all the awesome stuff going on. (If you guys have any ideas for what you want to see me do, please send them in.) This is the official post - if you’re going to be participating as a contributer, reblog with the tags you’ll be using in the tag section. A list of the blogs definitely involved (I’ll be updating this as needed - stopping the night before March 11th):  @cheerful-khr-art @ciaossu-imagines @foreverfamilyforevervongola​ @for-the-love-of-khr​ @incorrectkhr @katekyohrscenarios @reborn-imagines @vongola-scenarios @vongola-tales  " False text
