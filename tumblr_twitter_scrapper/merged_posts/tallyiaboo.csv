This guy literally inherited millions of dollars of property, but considered himself a self-made man because he also worked a job that was practically a hobby, completely unnecessary for him. He also complained that “our generation is so entitled” - because all of his stinking rich friends just got cushy jobs at their parents’ companies. He seriously had no fucking idea that this was a thing exclusive to the rich. So yeah, I definitely think this is 100% true. Explains the bizarre counterclaims, too, where some millenial acts like all Boomers are wealthy power brokers and no poor Boomers could possibly exist - again, it’s the filthy rich complaining about their own parents. The reason all their millenials vs boomers bullshit is so fucking out of touch with reality is that it’s all rooted in the capitalist class bickering about each other from their own incredibly insular, clueless perspective.  oh man i work on a horse farm and my boss is convinced that millennial are all entitled brats who dont want to work for anything and just want free things. and at dinner one night he and his wife were going on about it and i was straight up like “well I’m a millennial and i dont think that we are actually like that” and they started listing examples of all these rich kids who ride with them and i kinda did a “hang on. the only millennials you are exposed to are extremely wealthy extremely spoiled children who literally dont have to work. most of the millennial I’m exposed to are very highly educated very aware of their status in the world and flat broke and unable to overcome it because of how difficult our economic situation makes it in the usa.” and i kinda lectured them about it and they had no idea that the rich kids they know arent actually the norm.  this is so, so interesting ? ? ?"

She suggested this with the kind of half-arsed, sad-eyed, apologetic shrug that white women perform when it is less of a scene to administer psychological warfare against a brown child than it is to challenge your fellow white woman. That was my entire childhood.  I remember well the acute shock and confusion of that day. I  had been so damn sure Becky and I were having a good time. I felt so  guilty, despite my mother’s insistence that Becky’s mother was a racist  bitch and that I had done nothing wrong.

The climate of the Arctic is known to oscillate wildly, but scientists say this warmth is so extreme that humans surely have their hands in it and may well be changing how it operates. Temperatures are far warmer than ever observed in modern records, and sea ice extent keeps setting record lows. 2016 was the warmest year on record in the Arctic, and 2017 has picked up right where it left off. “Arctic extreme (relative) warmth continues,” Ryan Maue, a meteorologist with WeatherBell Analytics, tweeted on Wednesday, referring to January’s temperatures. Veteran Arctic climate scientists are stunned. “[A]fter studying the Arctic and its climate for three and a half decades, I have concluded that what has happened over the last year goes beyond even the extreme,” wrote Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colo., in an essay for Earth magazine. At the North Pole, the mercury has rocketed to near the melting point twice since November, and another huge flux of warmth is projected by models next week. Their simulations predict some places in the high Arctic will rise over 50 degrees above normal.  Continue Reading. " False link

Many members of the white nationalist group have been outspoken Trump supporters, including the founder of the movement itself, Richard Spencer. Trump has also appointed Steve Bannon as his chief strategist — a man who has been heavily associated with the “alt-right.” The “alt-right” is known for its extremist and racist views, as well as being severely anti-Semitic. It seems like the association between the Trump campaign and neo-Nazis won’t be broken any time soon, as his chosen national security advisor, General Mike Flynn, recently met with Heinz-Christian Strache — the head of Austria’s far-right Freedom Party, which was established by former Nazis after World War II. The Freedom Party was originally created to be a safe haven for Nazis and Nazi sympathizers after World War II and the Holocaust. In the ‘80s, Jörg Haider became its leader, and the party took a turn toward right-wing populism with a strong anti-immigration stance. As the New York Times explains, today, the party is “anti-foreigner, anti-Islam and anti-globalization” making it an appealing party for Europe’s far-right — much like the white nationalist “alt-right” in the U.S. It should be obvious that this meeting between Trump’s National Security Advisor and the leader of a neo-Nazi movement is extremely alarming. This meeting calls back to the words of representatives from the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, who spoke out after the “alt-right” held a chilling conference in Washington D.C. praising Trump. They reminded us, through their statement, that the Holocaust didn’t begin with killing – it began with words.    Well we know which Magazine is getting shutdown on January 21st.

A 2008 report from the organisation estimated that nearly 50,000 women die from complications in such procedures annually.Minister Ploumen said that the Trump administration’s decision risked undermining recent advances in women’s health.“We must not let this happen,” she said.“We need to compensate for this financial blow as much as possible, with a broad-based fund, where governments, businesses and civil society organizations can donate to - so that women can remain in control of their own bodies.”Read the full piece here" False link

Allowing a certain subset of trans people to participate in violent oppression of others doesn’t show shit, except that his handlers can point to him and claim they can’t possibly be doing anything wrong. They have their own trans person, after all! Cop that beats black people finally a trans person  “White dude is a cop, that’s somehow progressive for Reasons”  friendly reminder that cops aren’t people, they’re organic conduits of power serving white supremacist, settler-colonial, cisheteropatriarchal capitalist interests.  I’m a little confused about how this is a bad thing? If anything it’s good.. it’s nice to see a system that is traditionally racist and exclusive be open to accepting someone who is trans. Sure the law enforcement system is extremely corrupt and has a lot of things that need to be thoroughly changed, but isn’t that why stories like this are a good thing? Idk I just feel like the whole “all cops are evil and they can do no right” narrative is a little redundant and doesn’t really actually accomplish anything? Instead of condemning the system for “issues” like this, maybe more trans, gay, black, and other groups should be encouraged to join the force so that it no longer will be a corrupt system ruled by white cis heterosexual males. I mean, the article makes a couple of really great points (i.e. the safe place program). I just feel like the above comments literally contribute nothing to the conversation and don’t do anything to further the cause.   I mean I’m not trying to drag or fight or anything I’m honestly open to opinions and like to learn what others have to say and why they feel the way that they do about subjects like this. Could you maybe elaborate on why you feel that this is crippling the system further instead of helping it?  listen: you can’t claim that you aren’t trying to start a fight when you write a wall of Basic Dumbass Cliches and end with, “i feel like the above comments literally contribute nothing to the conversation and don’ t do anything to further the cause.”first off, whose cause? not my cause, i don’t cause with anyone who bats for fascists.and who are you exactly to determine what is and isn’t the right contribution? you definitely aren’t qualified to make that call, since you admit to not knowing shit outside running your mouth while showing you don’t know shit by saying that pigs might be part of a corrupt system, but now non cishet white dudes can be part of the corrupt system. yay, thank you for your contribution.  Okuuuurrr that’s all good and great but HOW do we FIX the issue is what I’m getting at… I’m not sure if you realize that I’m on your side? Me saying that your comments don’t contribute to the conversation means exactly what I said. All you’re doing is dragging the system but not giving any ways to transform it. We’ve all heard that. But I guess thanks for just spitting out a bunch of random information with no actual point for me to somehow process as something that helps society as a whole?  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/01/05/study-more-black-cops-wont-stop-police-killing-of-black-citizens/?utm_term=.7cc6716c699b  Finally, transgender people, too, can have all the fun of being a disgusting pig, not just cis people! #progress  tropicbro’s comments lmao" False link

While many choose their own name or a funny message, PewDiePie jokingly asked the pair to display: “DEATH TO ALL JEWS”. He published the resulting clip, showing them dancing and laughing while holding the antisemitic message above their heads, on his YouTube channel. While some fans found the clip funny, others said the star had gone too far. Despite requesting the hateful message to be displayed, and publishing the resulting video, PewDiePie apologised to fans at the end of the video – but still gave the performers a five-star rating. He said: “I am sorry. I didn’t think they would actually do it. I feel partially responsible. I mean I’ve got to give them five stars for an outstanding experience because at least they did what I asked.” He added: “I don’t feel good. I don’t feel too proud of this, I’m not gonna lie. I’m not antisemitic, or whatever it’s called, okay so don’t get the wrong idea. It was a funny meme, and I didn’t think it would work, okay. I swear I love jews, I love ‘em. “I am so sorry. I don’t know what else to say.”  pewdiepie paid some guys actual money to hold up a sign that said “DEATH TO ALL JEWS”, published it, gave them a 5-star rating, and then tried to shrug off any responsibility by saying he didn’t think they would really do it. he even says he only feels “partially” responsible and he’s “not antisemitic” despite the fact that he 1) posted this video so close to a surge in antisemitic hate crimes following trump’s election and 2) posted this video at all. this isn’t funny, this isn’t satire, it’s gross and hateful shock humor at the expense of people who are already unsafe with the increasingly emboldened neo nazis–i mean, “alt right”. it’s not defensible. stop supporting him.

For several years, they lived without visas under the radar of the authorities until they were put on a status known as “provisional release” in 2001. It means they can stay in Japan as long as their asylum application is under review. Asylum seekers are building Japan’s roads and sewersBut it also means they can’t work, they don’t have health insurance and they need permission to travel outside the prefecture where they live. They are also subject to unannounced inspections by immigration officers at their home and they face detention at any time. There are currently some 4,700 people with this status living in Japan. Gursewak, who has never left Japan, has inherited his parents’ provisional release status and all the restrictions that go with it. That fate has exposed him and more than 500 other children who share his predicament to lives of perpetual uncertainty. They can go to government-run schools, where tuition is largely free, but university is out of reach for most because they and their parents aren’t allowed to work and so can’t afford the fees. These children, many of whom are asylum seekers, will soon face a stark choice between forced unemployment and working illegally. “Since I was born I’ve only ever interacted with Japanese people,” said Gursewak, who is now 17, speaks the language with native fluency and considers himself Japanese. “I don’t get why Japan won’t accept me.” While there were almost 14,000 asylum cases under review at the end of 2015, Japan accepted only 27 refugees last year. The year before that, the number was 11.  Friendly reminder that Japanese human rights violations are way under-reported. The country is a fortress, hardly any immigrants or refugees are allowed in, and the few that are are exploited for cheap labor. The criminal justice system is notoriously corrupt, including numerous accusations of prosecutors and police straight up framing clients. The death penalty in Japan is also extra inhumane because inmates on death row are not told the date of their execution and essentially live in fear that every day could be their last.  " False link

He was cleaning up the front area of our neighborhood and a speeding driver hit him. I love my dad. I was his shadow. I also live with him.  I’m a college student who of course doesn’t make enough to bury my father, with no insurance, and to keep our house. I’m raising funds for our home and the burial.  I’m struggling right now because I was out there after it happened. I saw him die. I’m struggling. So please forgive me as I try to be an adult about this. Please help me out. Please please boost. I can’t keep writing a new post about this. It was hard enough to make the page, answer phone calls, and visitors to my house. I’m struggling. I’m hurt. I’m at a lost. I’m angry. I’m hoping to at least eliminate my financial burdens at this moment. Thank you so much for your support and shares. Please hug your parents for me. " False link
