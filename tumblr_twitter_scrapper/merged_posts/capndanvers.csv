The courts say the 38,000 survivors have 15 years to decide individually if their stories should be preserved in an archive at the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation (NCTR) at the University of Manitoba or be destroyed.

He’s concerned the mainstream media isn’t telling the whole story. “We just want to see for our own eyes what’s going on,” said Tregget while waving away a cloud of blackflies. “Migrants should go through the border legally. Some people are waiting to become Canadian citizens legally. We want everybody to go through the same process.”  Continue Reading.  It seems this group is misinformed.

Brian Graff claims the NDP’s decision to reject him was undemocratic and violates the party’s rules. He believes the party doesn’t want to allow his candidacy because some of his views run counter to NDP orthodoxy. The party suggests they rejected Graff’s bid for other reasons, including a criminal charge laid against him in 1993. Now, Graff wants the Ontario Superior Court to order the NDP to accept his leadership application. Graff, a Toronto resident who describes himself as “semi-retired” but who formerly worked in “financial analysis of real estate,” ran unsuccessfully for Toronto city council in 2014. He first informed the NDP of his intention to seek the leadership in October, but his candidacy was rejected in late December. He claims he was never given a reason for the rejection, and filed a request for a judicial review of the decision in March. In April, he dropped the legal challenge when the NDP agreed to let him reapply and to be more transparent about the reasons for whatever decision it would make. But when he reapplied, the party rejected him again immediately, this time with an explanation. According to the NDP, the major issue is a criminal charge laid against Graff. Nearly 25 years ago, he was found guilty of watching and besetting, a form of criminal harassment. He was given a conditional discharge, which is less serious than a conviction, though still a finding of guilt.  “Given the party’s commitment to protecting human rights and personal security … accepting an applicant who has been found guilty of such a crime would seriously damage our reputation,” NDP national director Robert Fox wrote to Graff in a letter submitted to court. The letter also describes Graff as having a “propensity for litigation.” Graff, however, believes the real reason he’s been rejected is that his views don’t align with NDP values. In particular, Graff wants to cut immigration and tie it to the unemployment rate. Fox’s letter does claim that Graff’s beliefs “run counter to the party’s principles.” It also quotes from a 2007 letter from Graff published in Toronto alt-weekly NOW Magazine, in which he suggested letting the NDP “cease to exist.” In fact, Graff’s affidavit states he was active in the Liberal Party from the 1980s to 2016, before he joined the NDP.

Lisa and Jay O’Connor’s 16-year-old daughter, Kiera, was diagnosed with a rare form of Hodgkin’s lymphoma. “I’m going in for another biopsy to either confirm or deny relapse,” Kiera said. Her sister, 14-year-old Kylie, has clinical depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. “It’s like I’m drowning in my own thoughts, I never stop thinking, and it’s not good thoughts that I’m thinking,” Kylie said. But the O’Connor family is upset that the one daughter with cancer may live, while the other may not. “It’s very apparent who gets help… it’s the cancer [patients], not the mental illness [patients],” Jay said. For the last month, Kylie has been in Victoria General Hospital as she awaits long term care. “My parents have been bending over backwards my entire life to try and get me help,” Kylie said. Lisa said for years they have been hitting one dead end after another. But after Kylie’s condition recently worsened, they fought tooth and nail to get a referral to B.C. Children’s Hospital, where their other daughter received cancer treatment. Kylie took part in a three-hour interview the family described as gruelling. “I was crying for some of the [personal] questions, it was so hard for me to answer a bunch of these questions,” Kylie said. However, Kylie was denied a bed in the hospital. “They kept telling us they’re not a treatment centre,” Jay said. She was also denied a spot in the special care unit at Vancouver Island’s Ledger House, according to Lisa. She said it would be a one-year wait for Kylie to get into Maples Adolescent Treatment Centre in Burnaby. “As a mother, [I] want to take care of both of [my] kids equally. [I] love them the same, it’s a constant fight,” Lisa said. “I will probably shock most people with what I’m going to say but if I had a choice about what disease or ailment, if I had to chose for my child, I would pick cancer over mental illness.” Now the family may be forced to part ways as they consider out-of-province care for Kylie. “It’s a sad state of affairs,” Jay said. @allthecanadianpolitics I was wondering if you’d seen this (I can’t seem to find it in your archive, if I missed it I’m sorry) and what your thoughts were on it.

In the piece, Hal Niedzviecki stated that he doesn’t believe in cultural appropriation and encouraged writers to “imagine other peoples, other cultures, other identities” as a solution to the undeniable fact that Canadian literature is overwhelmingly dominated by “people who are white and middle-class.” It’s akin to someone cooking and exclaiming, “This soup contains way too much salt! I’m now going to solve this problem by adding more salt.” A four-year-old could tell you that wouldn’t work. The idea that lack of diversity can be solved by having white writers who benefit from a system of privilege simply appropriate the voices and stories of the marginalized, instead of making genuine room for the excluded, is, despite its laugh-out-loud ludicrousness, an unavoidable symptom of being part of an elite group for whom the term “white saviour” was coined. Niedzviecki triumphantly ended his editorial with “Set your sights on the big goal: Win the Appropriation Prize.” His proposal, justifiably met with disbelief and outrage, prompted Cherokee-born writer Daniel Heath Justice to refer to it as “settler ventriloquism.” Faced with considerable backlash, Niedzviecki resigned from his position, and the Writers’ Union apologized. But it’s what came next that really took this controversy to another and much uglier level. Clearly upset that one of their own had been vilified and hankering to jump in and defend what they thought was truly at stake here — free speech — prominent members of mainstream media started pledging money for an Appropriation Prize.

The raising of the March for Life flag, which coincided with a major rally in Ottawa, angered many on social media and prompted several of Watson’s city council colleagues to demand it be taken down. “I have asked the City’s Clerk’s Office for a completed review of the Proclamations and Flag raising policy,” Watson tweeted. LifeSiteNews.com tweeted a video of a March for Life flag being raised at City Hall as about 20 people looked on. No elected officials appeared to be present at the flag-raising. In the video, a spokesman for the group said he was “so proud of the mayor and the [city] staff that they went along with this.” The mayor did not approve the flag-raising himself, and has publicly stated he supports a woman’s right to choose to have an abortion. But many people did not see it that way.  Continue Reading.  And the flag has been removed: " False link

He’s standing atop the Oneida Business Park, in Ohsweken, Ontario. The solar project he’s talking about produces 500 kilowatts of power, but that’s just a fraction of Six Nations total green energy holdings. Jamieson’s First Nation is one of more than 120 that has signed a treaty alliance opposing oil sands expansion and pipelines across North America. Battle lines are being drawn in Vancouver over Kinder Morgan’s planned expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline while other alliance members are in court fighting TransCanada’s Energy East pipeline. But while many of the alliance’s leaders are invoking standoffs like the Oka crisis and last winter’s Standing Rock in their fight to block fossil fuel energy projects in Canada, they are also looking to green energy alternatives, and to Six Nations as an example of how to do it. Tsleil-Waututh Nation counselor Charlene Aleck’s first nation, in North Vancouver, B.C., is on the front lines of the campaign to stop the Kinder Morgan project. “We’re not just the ‘forces of no,” Aleck said. “We are taking steps towards the ‘forces of yes.’ We definitely have a ‘yes agenda’ when it comes to green energy.” For the Tsleil-Waututh Nation, that means starting small – with a roof-top solar project on the new administration and health centre that’s now under construction. The Six Nations of the Grand River is already leading the country in renewable power projects, and is setting an example for its allies to follow.  Continue Reading. " False link

It’s the utter bane of my existence when people send me their manuscripts to edit, and I get a cover email that read along the lines of “I’m not a fan of romance novels so I added my own twist” and my soul curdles because first of all a) if you don’t like romance but you’re writing it because you’ve realized it’s lucrative and you think Anyone can do it because it’s “easy”: get the Hell out of my genre and b) suffering and misery instead of a happily ever after (or happy for now) are not twists. It’s not edgy, it’s not clever, in fact what it shows me is that you do not understand the genre on a fundamental level and shouldn’t be writing for it. Romance is a fantasy genre, people don’t read fantasy for endless suffering (thank you GRRMartin et al for making every edgelord in the world think nitty gritty detail = pain and suffering without relief and flooding the genre with their shitty reimaginings of the characters from Lord of the Rings but set to the plot of SAW) they read fantasy to know that the suffering  will end. That evil will eventually be defeated, that good things can and will still happen and that the sun will shine again. Romance is no different from that, except it is a genre primarily considered to be feminine and therefore subject to ridicule and the belief that somehow if a woman can do it, it must be easy “But Joy,” I hear some of you say, “Romance doesn’t have that reputation because of sexism, it’s because of how many bad writers get published in it and make it look bad.” *angry buzzer sound* oh I’m sorry that was incorrect, you see every genre has an abundance of shitty books that make it to print, whether it’s goofball sci-fi or Lord of the “all my characters are white because of historical accuracy” Rings 94949392.0 (or if you really want to start a fight, every mediocre white man considered a classic by the literary genre and lauded by academia for writing about wanting to have an affair with one of his students/the inevitability of death) and while they are subject to criticism, there’s still not quite the same vitriol that Romance gets for wanting, what is essentially, a happy life. There is nothing wrong with feel good media, there is nothing wrong with wanting to enjoy something a little bit silly and unapologetically happy. The popularity of coffee shop Aus in fandom is both unsurprising and nothing new. It’s quite literally common romance tropes that have been around forever but with the diversity of fandom (*eyes ao3 tag* kind of) and I will die on this hill defending the validity of Happily Ever Afters and Happily For Now before I let anyone try to take it from my icy cold grip. And if I get one more romance manuscript with a cover letter that says they’ve added a twist, then god dam y'all someone had better have twisted their ankle and been carried bridal style to their bed because I’m so over people hating on the simple want for happiness.   This commentary is the best commentary. Everyone else go home.  … no really. Please.
