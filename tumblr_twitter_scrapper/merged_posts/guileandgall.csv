The time rushes past Troy. So, when he finds her in his office at home, he’s determined to make the most of the surprise.Links: AO3 | FFnetSunset SurpriseThe house darkened with the setting of the sun. Only scant orange beams of light peeked through the curtains and blinds. As he approached his study, a bright shaft of light escaping the mostly closed door caught his notice, as did the soft humming from beyond it. While the first prompted the police chief’s hand to move for his sidearm, the second halted it and drew the corners of his mouth upwards, causing a flutter in his chest as well. As much as he hated their continued separation, he understood the need for it. In any city, especially Stilwater, appearances went a long way. And there was no chance the personal connection between the Chief of Police and an escaped suspect and reputed gang leader would go unnoticed. It could bring about both their downfalls. Rushing the last few steps down the hall, he stopped cold at the door. He took a long deep breath, his hand tensed into a fist before reopening to slowly press the door open. His body leaned with the action in hopes of catching sight of the intruder before she noticed him. Though Troy had not expected to find her in his study, his relief at the sight was unmistakable. Furia kept popping in on him here and there—his office, his home, she’d even hidden out in his car once to surprise him when he came out of work. Despite becoming used to the custom, she always found some way to surprise him.It wasn’t so much the actual act of finding her among the file cabinets, bookcases, and his father’s old oak desk that shocked him though. The startling part was her manner of dress. To see her standing there using an old shaving mirror to perch his uniform cap on her head at a precise and jaunty angle wiped away the tension the last week and a half had stored up in his shoulders. Any lingering stresses of the day, thoughts of the looming yearly reports, and the calls from the commissioner and the mayor faded away as he leaned in the doorway, watching her. His gaze moved over her, every inch, from the tiny blue skirt the same shade as his jacket, which engulfed her, to the way she had swirled her black hair up under his cap.“I think that looks better on you than me,” Troy noted, dropping his briefcase in a chair and hanging the hat in his hand on the coat hook by the door.She turned, placing her hands at her waist with a delicate flourish. Her grip cinched the sea of blue fabric in such a way as to highlight the cant of her hips. Her gaze remained on him for a moment—soft, warm, and inviting—she glanced downward, inviting his eyes to follow suit. Leaning against the edge of the desk, he made a thorough study of the outfit she’d clearly planned to the letter, from the black leather boots that stopped just below her knees to the high hem of her skirt. Following the gold buttons of his jacket upward, he found her smiling sweetly at him with a distracting look in her haunting hazel eyes. “It could use a little tailoring,” she stated in quiet reply.He hummed in consideration, taking very slow steps as he crossed the room deliberately popping loose the polished brass buttons on his own coat that matched hers in every detail except fit. Shrugging the coat off, he caught the collar in his hand and threw it over the chair as he crossed the room toward his lover. She didn’t move, except to shift her hips and give him tiny changes in her pose. He studied her, long and carefully. The playfulness in her countenance brought a smile to his lips, and filled his heart with a light joyfulness.“I think it looks quite fetching,” Troy argued.Her familiar smile took on the curl of a smirk. “You’re biased, flatterer.”“Biased I will freely own up to.” Troy slipped one hand around her waist in a smooth gesture, his eyes meeting hers, while his other hand grazed the edge of her jaw. “But my compliments are completely accurate.” His hand slipped behind her neck and pulled her lips to his. Troy let his body relax against hers when her arms encircled his shoulders, her hand smoothing down the back of his neck eased him further. Their mouths moved together in a languid kiss; her contented hum, soothing him. “I’m glad they didn’t keep you late,” she breathed softly, her deft fingers loosening his tie.The chief mirrored her actions in intent, slipping buttons loose on her jacket. Her costume piqued his deep interest. The possibility of peeling her out of his uniform enticed him more than he realized it might. She had gone the whole nine yards. One of his uniform shirts hung loose on her frame, secured with one of his ties at the base of her long neck. When her hands yanked at his tie, pulling it off in a slow hand over hand motion dotted with kisses, he gripped the lapels of the coat she wore. “If you would have told me you were coming, I would have brought dinner.” “That would have ruined my surprise.”“True.” The coat fell to the ground in a quiet rustle that concluded with the dull thud of his badge. Small tugs and the rustling of his shirt made her motives quite clear. “But I fear my cupboards are bare.”Furia leaned back in his embrace, tipping her chin downward and raising a brow at him. “I haven’t seen you in more than a week and you think I’m here for a snack?” she retorted. Pulling him close, her body shifted against his as her fingers threaded into his hair. Her kiss, like coming up for air, spoke volumes and reminded him once again that he was not the only one who was pained by the separation they allowed their paths in life to foist upon them.He took much less care than she had with his tie, jerking it loose in a smooth motion as he walked her back toward his desk.“Where are you taking me?” Troy said nothing, merely stopping his advance when her hips met the wood. “Oh, really?” she laughed softly against his mouth. “And what are you planning?”He smiled, intent to answer her in the same manner, in deed rather than word. After slipping her onto the edge of the desk, he held her face softly, renewing sweet, gentle kisses which quickly intensified. Her teeth on his lips, her tongue slipping past the same incited his fervor. Not having her close made moments like this feel frantic; like stealing time from the devil himself. As he slipped free the buttons of the shirt she confiscated, Furia leaned back against the desk, wrapping one of her legs around his hip as she watched his progress. That dare in her gaze was as appealing and frustrating as ever, but it sparked his own stubbornness. He ignored the last few fastened buttons, tugging the shirt open then pressing his lips to her pliant belly. When her hands teased through his hair, he let his own ghost up her sides. Placing kisses, higher and higher, his nose skimmed her skin and her body arched upward with a tender warm sigh.Looming over her, he watched Furia lean back once more, as she blinked at him. Following the curve of her ribs, his hands closed on the clasp of her bra between her breasts. Wearing a front clasp bra confirmed the notion that she had something planned. Troy tugged at the closure, pulling it away from her skin and slipping it loose. The mischievousness in his smile matched the devilishness in her gaze; it made him think for a moment that he might be playing right into her plans. In the next instant, he realized that really did not matter, because even if it was, he would gladly play a part in it. If she had a plan to seduce him, he’d be her fool without a hint of reservation. But it wasn’t without his own resources.He bared her breasts, pulling the bra out of the way as her hands threaded through his hair. His hands moved down her ribs once more then traveled upward, barely skimming the base of the swell before retreating. His touch teased around her breasts, raising goosebumps and puckering her nipples in anticipation.“Troy,” she breathed. Her fingers tightening in his hair. “Don’t tease.”Drawing his lips away from her stomach he leaned over her. “I thought you liked being teased.”“Mmm, I do. You know I do, but I want you.” Her hips shifted against his, without a doubt she’d know how much he wanted her, too. How much he ached for her.With one hand planted on the desk next to her head, he drew the other lightly along the length of her collar bone. “Impatient, huh?”She huffed at him.“Might just have to make you wait. Make you beg for it.”“I don’t beg,” she countered in that calm, almost menacing tone.Troy smirked. “Sure, you don’t,” he chided, finally pinching her nipple and giving it a tug. The moan that surround him, made his cock throb against the confines of his trousers. Going back to his teasing, Troy waited a moment for her to calm again. Once her eyes were back on him, he did the same to the other. The way she keened put him on edge. He could barely see past the haze of his own desire. Following that tug, he quickly lowered himself and wrapped his mouth around the taut sienna peak of her breast. Those incoherent sounds, her fingers tight in his hair, and her leg tightening around his waist stoked the tension in his groin. His skin burned under her touch as he took in every sound that escaped her lips or rumbled beneath her ribcage. He fought the urge to give in, the growing desire to yank her skirt up and his trousers down and bury himself in the heat of her. Troy was determined to make the wait worth it for her, to savor every inch of her.His mouth toyed with her other nipple, exacting a vocal and visceral response as she ground against his hips. Leaning over her, he inched her skirt upward with each roll of her body. Gliding his hands over the curve of them, he smirked at finding no panties.“Tell me you left them in the pocket of my jacket,” he pleaded.She gave him a little shrug and an almost innocent look. He mimicked it then raised his fingers to his mouth and licked them. “Sí,” she answered with heavy breaths before he even touched her. “Sí, figured it might be a nice surprise whenever you wore that one next. Like maybe during one of those tiresome meetings with the commissioner,” she described. When she said the word commissioner Troy’s teasing finger plunged into her, making her voice crack. He buried it inside her before drawing it out completely to circle her clit before starting a long slow circuit. “I mean finding something soft and lacy in your pocket might just make one of those meetings easier to bear.” Her hips moved with the motion of his hand, her voice shaking and cracking with the teasing of each stroke. Feeling the heat of her, inhaling her scent, none of it did anything for his control. “Tell me more.”Furia’s breaths shook. Her eyes darted to his again with a pleading look. “Figure it might conjure warm memories. Make those grinding meetings glide by.” The way she drew out the vowels in her words and flicked her tongue against her lips pushed his arousal to the edge of painful. “Then later when you’re in your office alone, when you can take them out, imagine me wearing them. See me stepping out of them and perching on the edge of your desk with my knees open just wide enough to flash a glimpse of flesh.”“Fuck, Sol,” he groaned, biting her belly“Por favor. Te quiero dentro de mi, ahora![i]”Troy didn’t know much Spanish, but over the years he’d picked up a little more and he knew te quiero mean I want you and ahora meant now; the rest he could guess from her tone. He straightened a hair and struggled one-handed to get his belt off and slacks undone. Furia finally leaned up, just enough to help him. As she pulled him close again, her tongue thrusting past his lips, Troy slipped his finger out of her stroking her wetness over the tip of his cock before giving into both their desires. With that first thrust, they moaned in unison against one another’s mouths. They traded kisses with the same wanton abandon as they fucked. Her nails dug into the flesh of his ass as she pulled him into her. His hand slipped between them, hurrying to press firm circles around her clit, just to ensure that he’d feel her climax before his own. It worked. A strangled cry of his name left her shaking in his embrace, though she still jerked his hips toward hers as she rolled her hips into his every thrust. Her orgasm inspired his, and even after he ejaculated she still moved, moaning with that vibrant twinge in her voice. He moved with her insistent hands until he couldn’t bare it any longer and stilled.Holding her, her body quivered in his embrace. Her breath burned against his neck as she buried her face against him.“Perhaps I should wear your uniform more often.”“Or maybe you should just encourage me to think about fucking you on my desk.”He could feel her smile against the side of his neck. “You really do like doing that.”“Gives me a memorable distraction when the paperwork piles up.”She leaned back enough for him to see her face, glistening with sweat. “Oh, please tell me your secretary has caught you rubbing one out to the memory of us fucking on your desk.”“Not yet, though there’s been ample opportunity.”Furia giggled, her head falling back with the mirthful sound. “What about you?” Troy countered.“I’ve never been caught jilling off by your secretary.”He laughed, pressing a gentle peck to her lips. “You know what I meant.”“Why do you think I was in here playing dress up?” Her hands draped around his neck. “Though I do have to say, the best one is still the traffic stop. Is that video still going around the precinct?”“You’re a dangerous woman.”“Sometimes, but I’m really good at it.”“That you are,” Troy agreed as he toed his shoes off then stepped out of his slacks. Encouraging her to tighten her legs around him, he lifted her off the desk.“And just where are you taking me, Chief?”“I think you need to be detained for further interrogation.”Furia grinned. “You do, do you?”“Yes, a very thorough interrogation.”“Don’t I have the right to counsel?”Troy considered it for a moment. “You’re not under arrest, just being held for questioning. Plus, I think a lawyer would just get in the way.”“I don’t know. Get the right one and this could get really fun,” she teased.His laughter blended with hers. “You’re more than enough woman for me, not sure I could handle extras.”Lowering them onto the bed, he was glad she just let it go at that. Troy intended to savor every moment they had together that night, like he always did when she darkened his doorstep. Those visits felt far too sparse with far too much time between them. And the last thing he wanted was someone coming between them during those rare moments. No, he wanted her all to himself, which didn’t seem too unreasonable since she’d be gone again before the sun rose. The thought saddened him, but her hands guiding his lips back to hers managed to quell it for the time being.***a/n: Inspired by this gifset: http://aconfidentgentleman.tumblr.com/post/119697752158[i] I want you inside me, now!"

I have, and I’m terrible at it. To be honest, sometimes writing with a large number of characters can be a lot like juggling. As the author, we need to keep one character’s story moving while keeping all the others in the air, too. This can be really tricky. So how do we do this?  Make each character count. When you are creating your characters, ask yourself how important this character is to the story. If you definitely need them and they are big enough to be named, then make sure you treat him or her like any other important character. Make the character relatable, engaging to the reader, and have an emotional connection. Give them a specific job or purpose to the story.  Take your time introducing new characters. Not only will this help the reader to keep your large cast straight, but it will also help them to forge that all-important emotional connection to the person (or creature or object etc.). Try not to introduce them all at once. It’s overwhelming and doesn’t help your story. If it feels like you have no other way to introduce them, try asking for an outside opinion (Beta readers).  Focus on a few. I’ll come back to this a little in the last point. Basically, make sure that you are still focusing on your major characters and not becoming side-tracked with all the other characters. Also make sure that you are spending the most time with these characters… don’t stay away from them for too long (30-40 pages without one is too much). If you don’t have enough to say with that character, it might be an indication to downgrade them to minor.  Be careful with naming. This is true regardless of the number of characters in your story. I once named a pair of twins Garan and Gwylan (in my long ago high school days) only to realize that they were almost impossible to tell apart. And they needed to be identifiable. Another example was in my current query, I had two groups of djinn: the Candrima and Candrani. I couldn’t even keep them straight, and I wrote them! I ended up cutting the name for the Candrima. But this same principle applies especially here. If your characters’ names are too similar, they will become indistinguishable from one another and only serve to confuse the reader and slow the pace.  Be careful with how many POVs (points of view) you use. While it may seem like a good idea to let every character have their fifteen minutes, it’s not. Too many points of view can be frustrating and confusing to the audience. This is especially true in young adult and younger stories, where publishers often encourage authors to stick to two or fewer major POVs due to the age range of the intended audience. Check into how many are typically acceptable in your genre and age range. And remember, authors like George R. R. Martin can be exceptions to the rules, so learn what is expected so that you are able to decide whether to stick with it or break them with intention. So there you have it! Five tips for juggling large casts of characters. That being said, how many of you are struggling with this? How many of you are writing many characters in your current work? I’d love to hear about it, so send me an ask or reblog with comments! " False text

Thanks to exposure, you’re more likely to say the original pronunciation even speaking in English. Some words are toss-ups if they’ve been heavily Anglicized, but for the most part, it’s original pronunciation or at least the ability to code switch between the two pronunciations. This, however, does not mean you should transcribe accents. It’s something you can have other characters note (or have the character react whenever the word is pronounced with an English accent), but phonetically transcribing accents is generally a bad idea.

The world needs to know.   Update 1: They’re exchanging fire from both sides. Electricity is down.

It can be the result of a political debate. Tammy Duckworth was running for the Senate against Mark Kirk and, as a veteran who had lost both of her legs fighting for this country, she made it a point to remind everyone that she comes from a line of veterans who had fought bravely for this country.   Mark Kirk’s response:  ""I had forgotten that your parents came all the way from Thailand to serve George Washington.“ She didn’t get down in the gutter with him.  She just tweeted this instead. Shot.  Down. It could be the result of sexism in the European Parliament. Janusz Korwin-Mikke of Poland opened his face to defend the gender wage gap.  He said, “Women must earn less because they are weaker, they are smaller, they are less intelligent.  They must earn less.  That is all.”  Iraxte Garcia-Perez of Spain was not having it. “According to your opinion, I shouldn’t have the right to be here as a member of parliament. And I know that it hurts you and bothers you that today women can sit in the House to represent citizens with the same rights as you. I am here to defend all European women from men like you.” Have a seat, caveman. It could be the result of lies about Planned Parenthood. During the congressional hearings against Planned Parenthood two years ago – you know, after those edited videos about babyparts that have been completely debunked – Congress spent millions of taxpayer funds to hold hearings.  Rep. Jason Chaffetz condescendingly tried to lead Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards down the garden path to some big reveal where he would confront her with hard facts and a handy visual aid. But the graph was bogus and Cecile called him out on it right there in the middle of the hearing.  Get that mess outta here, Chaffetz! Anyway, Sally Yates came through big time with two slam dunks and I just want to save these so I can relive the moment when I need a pick me up. First she had to hand John Cornyn’s ass back to him on a platter when he had the audacity to question her actions in defying a Presidential order when during her confirmation as Attorney General, he wanted assurance from her that she would do just that if need be. When she hit “You specifically asked me…” I hollered.  That’s a receipt if ever I did see one. Then Ted Cruz, as punchable as every, tried it in the worst way and he knew exactly what he was doing.  Instead of saying “are you familiar with the law that says X” he pulled out the actual code, as if everyone has every piece of relevant case law labeled neatly in some rolodex in their brain.  She knew exactly what Cruz was referring to – she just didn’t know the label because who would know the label!  And then she trumped him with law that was even more relevant than the one he tried to embarrass her with.  The exchange between Sen. Ted Cruz and Former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates https://t.co/3mI2yPBgc5 pic.twitter.com/xxybuqp1gu— Los Angeles Times (@latimes) May 8, 2017  Nothin but net, Sally.  Nothin but net.   This is just food for the soul.  Even President Velveeta said one qualified woman is worth ten men (yes, he actually said that, which is why he’s so threatened by successful women) and these garbage men in politics need to wise up and realize nobody is here for their games and blatant disrespect.  I love the fact that Sally Yates schooled both Texas Senators. Unfortunately, it won’t effect their election chances. " False text

It’s the utter bane of my existence when people send me their manuscripts to edit, and I get a cover email that read along the lines of “I’m not a fan of romance novels so I added my own twist” and my soul curdles because first of all a) if you don’t like romance but you’re writing it because you’ve realized it’s lucrative and you think Anyone can do it because it’s “easy”: get the Hell out of my genre and b) suffering and misery instead of a happily ever after (or happy for now) are not twists. It’s not edgy, it’s not clever, in fact what it shows me is that you do not understand the genre on a fundamental level and shouldn’t be writing for it. Romance is a fantasy genre, people don’t read fantasy for endless suffering (thank you GRRMartin et al for making every edgelord in the world think nitty gritty detail = pain and suffering without relief and flooding the genre with their shitty reimaginings of the characters from Lord of the Rings but set to the plot of SAW) they read fantasy to know that the suffering  will end. That evil will eventually be defeated, that good things can and will still happen and that the sun will shine again. Romance is no different from that, except it is a genre primarily considered to be feminine and therefore subject to ridicule and the belief that somehow if a woman can do it, it must be easy “But Joy,” I hear some of you say, “Romance doesn’t have that reputation because of sexism, it’s because of how many bad writers get published in it and make it look bad.” *angry buzzer sound* oh I’m sorry that was incorrect, you see every genre has an abundance of shitty books that make it to print, whether it’s goofball sci-fi or Lord of the “all my characters are white because of historical accuracy” Rings 94949392.0 (or if you really want to start a fight, every mediocre white man considered a classic by the literary genre and lauded by academia for writing about wanting to have an affair with one of his students/the inevitability of death) and while they are subject to criticism, there’s still not quite the same vitriol that Romance gets for wanting, what is essentially, a happy life. There is nothing wrong with feel good media, there is nothing wrong with wanting to enjoy something a little bit silly and unapologetically happy. The popularity of coffee shop Aus in fandom is both unsurprising and nothing new. It’s quite literally common romance tropes that have been around forever but with the diversity of fandom (*eyes ao3 tag* kind of) and I will die on this hill defending the validity of Happily Ever Afters and Happily For Now before I let anyone try to take it from my icy cold grip. And if I get one more romance manuscript with a cover letter that says they’ve added a twist, then god dam y'all someone had better have twisted their ankle and been carried bridal style to their bed because I’m so over people hating on the simple want for happiness.  other acceptable twists: polyamory  And polyamory. Things I am now looking for in my romance twists, twisted ankles, polyamory and people doing Chubby Cheker’s The Twist at weddings. That is the acceptable list of twists.  Chocolate twists?  Okay, yes good. Unless your characters have celiac in which case no, I will not allow that kind of suffering.  So what you’re saying is that I should send YOU the happy multi-racial poly family feels novel whenever I get it written.  @intheafterlight, abso-freaking-lutely, please do.  The twist in my romance novel (NECESSARY MEDICINE BY MICHELLE K. YORK, COMING OUT ON APRIL 24th FROM HARLEQUIN IMPRINT CARINA PRESS, NOW AVAILABLE FOR PRE-ORDER) is that everyone involved is an adult who makes rational decisions.  Speaking as a veteran editor of this genre…that..that seems fake but okay…(I’m teasing, and congrats on the publication!)  @thebibliosphere can the twist be that the woman is, according to genre convention, going to fall in love with The Manly Man Who Is Rich And Good Looking And Whatever Other Stuff Makes Women In Romance Novels Go For Dudes I’m Sorry Men Are A Mystery To Me, and instead she marries him halfway through because political expediency (I guess this is a medieval romance now), falls in actual love with his maid, and he’s like “yo, actually I’m very into one of my knights who is quite sad our days of gallivanting in ambiguously homoerotic ways had to end with my wedding, so like, if you can take one for the team and sleep with me long enough to have a kid, you can have a girlfriend and I’ll have my knight and epic tales of our romances shall be written” and the lady of the piece is like “frick yeah”? Okay so the accepted twists now include twisted ankles, polyamory, the dance the twist, gluten free chocolate twists, happy functional relationships, the game twister, the card game, and happy lavender marriages where everyone gets to love who they love and circumvent the expectations of society. Things that are not accepted on my desk: surprise all your gays are dead! surprise the mentally ill person is the villain! surprise, your disabled character can now get up and tap dance due to the power of love! and also wheat and wheat byproducts. Not because they’re a surprise I’m just really allergic to wheat. " False link

She’s a van driver for a production company. She works 14-hour days but says she doesn’t mind, says she keeps one eye on the road and the other on the prize — a paycheck that has to last through the dead months. We’re driving through a poor stretch of Atlanta. Dirty streets. Old houses. Plastic toys upturned in front yards, no kids though. The neighborhood is quiet. I live in L.A., land of nannies and gardeners where the hills are alive with the sound of toddlers and leaf blowers. I prefer Atlanta. You can find parking at the grocery store in the middle of the day. In L.A. it doesn’t matter what time it is, the Trader Joe’s is packed with SAHs and WAHs (stay-at-homes and work-at-homes.) We pass a decades-old Buick Skylark. I point it out. “You into cars?” Mae asks. I’m not into cars, but my dad and I once abandoned one of those Buicks on the side of a Florida highway when I was a teenager. That’s how my family did cars — we bought them on their last leg and left them where they died. I tell her how I’d come home from high school and there’d be nothing in the fridge but a bottle of red wine vinegar and a head of lettuce. On the counter, there’d be a bag of potatoes and a bottle of olive oil from the Dollar Store. That was dinner, potatoes and lettuce. “I hear you,” she says. “We had ketchup sandwiches all the time growing up. We didn’t complain. We ate them.” Mae’s voice is rich, melodic, it’s Maya Angelou meets Gladys Knight. I tell her about the time I borrowed red stirrup pants. (Remember stirrup pants from the 80s?) I borrowed them from my friend Marla. Her two older brothers drove Corvettes, one each. Marla drove a more sensible car for a 16-year-old, an Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. But it was new. And it was hers. She let me borrow the pants for a party in her neighborhood. (God knows I couldn’t go in my own shit clothes.) Long and short of it, the pants ripped in the calf. My mother wept like death had come, struggling with red thread, looking at me like I’d done the worst thing ever. Marla wanted $17 to replace them. Mae invites me to sit up front with her. The traffic to my hotel is bad, we’re in for a haul. I switch out at the next red light. “So her brothers drive corvettes?” Yup. “One each?” Yup. “Lord Almighty,” she says, “folks of privilege don’t understand how $17 can ruin you.” Mae tells me how she’d come home from school and her mother would hustle her and her sisters upstairs to pick out clothes for the next day before the utilities cut off. Too many red notices. I was poor in Florida. Mae’s from Detroit. I ask what she did to keep warm. “Poor kids just do what they gotta do. Privileged kids panic if they can’t have new this and new that, or if they can’t be on a sport team. Sports and heat, those are luxuries.” I ask if she’s heard of John Prine, the folk singer. I sing his line: It’s a half an inch of water and you think you’re gonna drown. She howls, “Rich folks standing in a puddle screaming!” I tell her about my parents shaking me awake in the middle of the night whispering, we have to go now. There’s a difference between going and getting out. What we were doing was getting out before morning, before the neighbors would see us evicted. “I hear you,” she says. “Lord Almighty, I hear you.” America loves helping the shoeless, iphoneless, voteless, bug-infested Street Jesuses. These are the lost-cause poor; all they want is your pocket change. (Bless their hearts.) But the working poor? Those who claim to not have enough money for food because they also need clothes for work, water for bathing and laundry, rent for housing, heat in the winter, money for daycare, a smartphone for their job, car insurance and gas — those are some shifty motherfuckers. If you’re on food stamps America has every right to hate you, as evidenced by this angry conservative yelling at a father and child for using food stamps. This lady proves conservatives love a good hate like they love a good steak. I assume she thinks of herself as a nice person, a good person, a church-goer. We all think everyone else is the asshole, right? There isn’t a lot of self-directed road rage out there. How often do we key our own cars? It’s always okay to hate the other guy when the hate is justified — like child predators, rapists, and food stamp users. Huddled round the Fox News campfire are those who love tall tales of poor people using tax dollars to buy drugs and alcohol and Gucci shoes. That’s not how it works. I’ve been on food stamps. The government doesn’t hand out wads of cash. When you qualify for food stamps you receive a plastic grocery card that only works for food transactions. Key word: qualify. You don’t just sign up. It’s not a tennis lesson at the club. What’s scary about the woman in the video is that she sees what’s in the dad’s cart (food for his kid) and she hates him for it. Stupid fucking poor people. If only we’d been engineer majors in college. If only we’d gone to college. If only our parents hadn’t been poor. If only they spoke English. If only we worked harder. If only we were more like conservatives who believe everything they have today is a direct result from the sweat of their own brow. When looking at a spider’s web can you point to the 8th spun web, or the 108th? There are those who claim this astounding ability — those who take full credit for crafting, spin by spin, a better life than ours, a life without aid. If you had help paying for college, if someone bought you your first car, if you had health insurance growing up, if your mom never cried over $17, you were lucky. The Hail Mary toss of birth landed you in a family that could put you on a soccer team and buy cleats as your foot grew. And someone was home to help you with your math and give you a gummy vitamin each morning. That’s called aid, by the way. And not all kids get it, but all kids should. Don’t confuse aid with charity. Charity is old coats. Donating a coat doesn’t make you a good person but I bet it makes you feel like one. You didn’t even want that coat anymore, what you wanted was the closet space. Sure, you could have sold it at a garage sale and made, like, twenty bucks. It was an expensive coat, damn it. But you, with your heart of gold, gave it away. There’s a twinkle in God’s eye just for you. What makes you a good person to others (and not just to yourself) is the same thing that makes me, or anyone who can afford the occasional $12 cocktail, a good person: Your vote. Not your coat. Vote for a Living Wage for others. Vote for health insurance for others. Don’t get in the way of food stamps for others. Understand how important $17 might be to others. That poor stretch of Atlanta is quiet because people are working and paying for day care. They’re clocking the same hours you’re clocking, but they make a shit wage.  Take a good long look at your feet. If you were born at the starting line wearing a nice pair of running shoes, that was luck. Sheer luck. The most important thing you can do now is help those who had to start the race a mile behind you, barefoot.   Wowowow this is beautiful. " False link

I don’t know why. Each sentence has a rhythm or cadence, and sometimes it just sounds wrong unless I phrase it just right. There’s good repetition, and there’s bad repetition.One thing that can affect your sentence fluency is word repetition. Changing up your word choice doesn’t mean you have to resort to some highly eloquent speech or anything. In fact, you should NEVER raid the thesaurus just for the sake of mixing it up. There’s no rule for word variation. There’s no “you can only use the same word once every 500 words” or something. It’s something you want to be aware of, but if your character is more likely to say “like” instead of “such as,” it’s not bad writing to have them say “like” 90% of the time. That allows your narrator to have their own voice. As such, I’d be more concerned about a lack of word variation in a smaller excerpt of text (like a paragraph or a page) as opposed to larger chunks like chapters or the book as a whole. It’s an art, because while you don’t want to lean into bad repetition, you also don’t want to make things so complicated that you’ve lost your reader. You don’t want to jump through hoops to avoid repeating yourself, or that will mess up your sentence cadence even more. An example of this would be a word like “door,” where there really aren’t any synonyms for it. I mean, technically there are, like “portal” or “entry” or “ingress” or something, but I mean, if you’re just talking about the door to a bedroom, any of those words are highly inappropriate. A door can just be a door. It’s a matter of fancy footwork to keep things from dragging. Here’s an example with heavy repetition of the word “door.”  With a deep draw of breath, I stepped towards the door. This time I’d do it. I’d knock and I wouldn’t leave until she opened the door. Each step was firm with confidence, and far too soon, I stood in front of her door. I set my shoulders and raised my hand to knock. The proximity to her door almost made me turn away, but I was already decided. I knocked. After a pause, the door opened on silent hinges.  Despite it being a common word without many sensible replacements, you CAN avoid overusing it.  With a deep draw of breath, I stepped towards her room. This time I’d do it. I’d knock and I wouldn’t leave until she let me in. Each step was firm with confidence, and far too soon, I stood in front of her door. I set my shoulders and raised my hand to knock. The proximity to the painted wood that hid my sister from the world almost made me turn away, but I was already decided. I knocked. After a pause, the door opened on silent hinges.  If you’re worried about word variation, here are some things you can do to catch yourself:  Try rewording your sentence. Even if you use the same word, if it’s used in a different spot in the sentence it’s not as annoying. If you start every sentence with “The door” then your lack of word variation is all the more glaringly obvious, since it’s also paired with a lack of sentence variation.  Think of another way to say it, even if it’s not necessarily a synonym. In my example, I substituted “door” with “painted wood.” Not all painted wood is a door, but since the door was already mentioned, I can trust my reader to know what I’m talking about.  Read it out loud. I know, like, every writing advice thing says this and no one actually does it, but seriously. You will catch so much. Awkward sentence cadence, missed words, inorganic dialogue. Plus, if you’re alone and you don’t have to worry about listening in, you can get into it and give your characters all a different voice and call yourself a dork.  Don’t raid the thesaurus. Please don’t. Please, please. For fun, I’m going to replace every usage of “door” with the order they’re listed for Word’s thesaurus. Granted, the differences between these synonyms for “door” should be more obvious than other words, but any improper thesaurus raiding basically reads like this:  With a deep draw of breath, I stepped towards the entrance. This time I’d do it. I’d knock and I wouldn’t leave until she opened the gate. Each step was firm with confidence, and far too soon, I stood in front of her entry. I set my shoulders and raised my hand to knock. The proximity to her exit almost made me turn away, but I was already decided. I knocked. After a pause, the access opened on silent hinges.  That’s for a common word like “door,” at least. Honestly, repeating a word like “door” isn’t a huge problem. It’s common, and we’re used to hearing it all the time. You can reword a bit so you’re not using it every sentence, but don’t worry about using it more than once on the same page. When it comes to uncommon words and phrases, you need to be a bit more careful. Dropping in some words like “jubilant” or “morose,” while pretty, will also attract more attention. Disclaimer, here: I think adding in some higher-level vocabulary is a great and powerful thing for your writing. It adds some flavoring and color, and you’re doing good for your readers too, by teaching them some cool new words. But those colorful new vocab words also stick out since we’re not used to hearing them. When you use an uncommon word multiple times on the same page or even in the same chapter, it feels jarring and unnatural. So keep adding in some nice new words, but keep it to a sprinkling. You might not notice yourself repeating these words in drafts, so have a friend or writing buddy read it. They’re more likely to notice the repetition than you are. By the way, did you subconsciously notice that I used the word “cadence” multiple times in this post? It’s one of those more uncommon words that will catch your attention, even if you’re not consciously thinking about it. (I snuck it in so you could see the example for yourself!) If you’re not aware of which words you might be over using, here’s a handy dandy word counter thing for you! Simply paste in a chapter or however much, and it’ll tell you how many times you use certain words. Please be smart when using this. Obviously you’re going to have a billion uses of “the” and “a” and stuff, so don’t go through trying to varying up your transitional and prepositional words. If you are using the same word (not including every “and” and “but”, like I said) maybe 10+ times in the same chapter, go through each instance and see if there’s a better way to say it, at least for a few of them. Most of my current WIP takes place in a cemetery. Although there’s technically a difference between a cemetery and a graveyard, my narrator doesn’t care enough to make the distinction, so I have her swap out between the two terms. Since it’s part of my setting, these words will still turn up a lot and they’ll become “common” to my readers, but I think it’s a nice little way to keep things fresh. And despite bullet point #4, you can use the thesaurus. In fact, thesauruses are awesome. But be deliberate with which word you choose as your replacement. Make sure the connotation and the meaning fit up with what you’re going for.  Subscribe to the Character Comma emailing list to get writing tips like these straight to your inbox :)  " False link

The teacher’s rebuttal:  I just commented this on a transphobic post that was all like, “In a sexual species, females have two X chromosomes and males have an X and a Y, I’m not a bigot it’s just science.” I’m a science teacher so I responded with this. First of all, in a sexual species, you can have females be XX and males be X (insects), you can have females be ZW and males be ZZ (birds), you can have females be females because they developed in a warm environment and males be males because they developed in a cool environment (reptiles), you can have females be females because they lost a penis sword fighting contest (some flatworms), you can have males be males because they were born female, but changed sexes because the only male in their group died (parrotfish and clownfish), you can have males look and act like females because they are trying to get close enough to actual females to mate with them (cuttlefish, bluegills, others), or you can be one of thousands of sexes (slime mold, some mushrooms.) Oh, did you mean humans? Oh ok then. You can be male because you were born female, but you have 5-alphareductase deficiency and so you grew a penis at age 12. You can be female because you have an X and a Y chromosome but you are insensitive to androgens, and so you have a female body. You can be female because you have an X and a Y chromosome but your Y is missing the SRY gene, and so you have a female body. You can be male because you have two X chromosomes, but one of your X’s HAS an SRY gene, and so you have a male body. You can be male because you have two X chromosomes- but also a Y. You can be female because you have only one X chromosome at all. And you can be male because you have two X chromosomes, but your heart and brain are male. And vice - effing - versa. Don’t use science to justify your bigotry. The world is way too weird for that shit.

We must fight back with equal force. But let me be clear: I’m of course not calling for violence or any of the thuggish behavior of the Trump supporters during the campaign. I’m calling for what ACT UP, the life-saving AIDS activist group with which I was involved, did in the ‘80s and ‘90s when our lives were at stake, when our people were dying all around us, and when the government allowed the deaths because it believed nobody cared about dying and dead queers. ACT UP shut down the Food and Drug Administration ― “Seize Control of the FDA,” as we called the demonstration. The sacred floor of the New York Stock Exchange was invaded. The National Institutes of Health were stormed. The CBS Evening News was literally interrupted by an activist who got on the set. Mass at St Patrick’s Cathedral by the virulent homophobe Cardinal O’Connor was stopped by die-ins in the aisles of the iconic church. A giant condom was even lowered over the home of the late horrifically anti-gay Republican senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina. There were many die-ins, and many sit-ins, and traffic was stopped over and over again in cities across America. We were called every name in the book, but there was so much at risk and we had little to lose. ACT UP persevered and changed the course of history, a story that has been told many times in recent years. The atmosphere then, while of a different time and very different experience, appears similar in many ways to the one we’re living in now, as we see the possibility of our democracy dying and of many people suffering.

Some highlights: First, some background on the coal industry: Profitability for U.S.  coal-fired power plants has been declining and coal use has dropped  radically since 2007—a trend that is expected to continue… The one energy sector that is growing at an incredible rate is the solar industry—and it is hiring… Our study  found that this growth of solar-related employment could benefit coal  workers, by easily absorbing the coal-industry layoffs over the next 15  years and offering full-time careers… Our results show that there is a wide variety of  employment opportunities in the solar industry, and that the annual pay  is attractive at all levels of education, with even the lowest skilled  jobs paying a living wage (e.g., janitors in the coal industry could  increase their salaries by 7% by becoming low-skilled mechanical  assemblers in the solar industry). In general, we found that after  retraining, technical workers would make more in the solar industry than  previously in coal. However, managers and particularly executives would  make less… The results of the study show that a  relatively minor investment ($180 million to $1.8 billion, based on best  and worst case scenarios) in retraining would allow the vast majority  of U.S. coal workers to switch to solar-related positions. Of course,  training times depend on type of job and prior experience. " False link
