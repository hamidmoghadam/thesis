Then get an accountant. Read Becoming a Writer,  by Dorothea Brande. Then do what it says, including the tasks you think  are impossible. You will particularly hate the advice to write first  thing in the morning, but if you can manage it, it might well be the  best thing you ever do for yourself. This book is about becoming a  writer from the inside out. Many later advice manuals derive from it.  You don’t ­really need any others, though if you want to boost  your confidence, “how to” books seldom do any harm. You can kick-start a  whole book with some little writing exercise. Write a book you’d like to read. If  you wouldn’t read it, why would anybody else? Don’t write for a  perceived audience or market. It may well have vanished by the time your  book’s ready. If  you have a good story idea, don’t assume it must form a prose  narrative. It may work better as a play, a screenplay or a poem. Be  flexible. Be aware that anything that appears before “Chapter One” may be skipped. Don’t put your vital clue there. First paragraphs can often be struck out. Are you performing a haka, or just shuffling your feet? Concentrate your narrative energy on  the point of change. This is especially important for  historical fiction. When your character is new to a place, or things  alter around them, that’s the point to step back and fill in the details  of their world. People don’t notice their everyday surroundings and  daily routine, so when writers describe them it can sound as if they’re  trying too hard to instruct the reader. Description must work for its place.  It can’t be simply ornamental. It ­usually works best if it has a human  element; it is more effective if it comes from an implied viewpoint,  rather than from the eye of God. If description is coloured by the  viewpoint of the character who is doing the noticing, it becomes, in  effect, part of character definition and part of the action. If you get stuck, get away from your  desk. Take a walk, take a bath, go to sleep, make a pie, draw, listen to  ­music, meditate, exercise; whatever you do, don’t just stick there  scowling at the problem. But don’t make telephone calls or go to a  party; if you do, other people’s words will pour in where your lost  words should be. Open a gap for them, create a space. Be patient. Be ready for anything. Each new story  has different demands and may throw up reasons to break these and all  other rules. Except number one: you can’t give your soul to literature  if you’re thinking about income tax." False link
