The man who ran the store was really scary; he used to yell at me all the time, like “Don’t pick that up if you’re not going to buy it!!” I went back there for the first time in 11 years, right after the Fire era. The man wasn’t there, because he wasn’t feeling well, but his wife was running the store in his place.  In the (center or back, I can’t remember) of the store, there was a huge sticker of Jhope’s face. It was a sticker or a poster of sorts. But it was his face, with a smile on his face like this *smiles* I asked the wife, “Do you know who this is?” And she replied back with “Yes, they’re pretty cool!” It was really cool and weird.  Then these two 7 or 8 year old girls came in, and when they saw me, they started saying “Wait, aren’t you…?” I was so deep in reminiscence that I was caught off guard. I pointed at the poster, and said to the wife, “THAT’S ME!” Even though, you know, that’s Jhope, but it had “BTS” on it so I figured it wouldn’t be a big deal.  I ran outside the store, and looked back. The two girls were following me. I should’ve just smiled, and said “What’s up?” But I was so panicked for no reason, that I began to run. And you know, once you start running you can’t just stop. So I ran for 5 minutes straight. To the two ladies at ○○ Stationary, around 7 to 8 years old, if you’re watching this, I’m sorry for running away from you that day. Next time, I’ll smile and greet you.“ -Kim Namjoon " False text

But then Blondie comes over to Gramma and Larry and ruffles Larry’s hair like she knows him really well or something, so Gramma’s like ???????  Anyway the dancer ended her routine by taking off her bra and revealing that she was a drag queen.

On Wednesday, the massive adult entertainment destination took the  somewhat surprising step of launching the “Pornhub Sexual Health  Center.”  They’re hoping the free sub-site  will become a go-to resource for some of their 70 million daily users  on all manner of topics, including STIs, sexual safety and how to manage  relationships. They’ve chosen Dr. Laurie Betito, a renowned sex therapist, to direct  the site and they’ll also be working with a number of doctors,  therapists and other experts to offer advice and answer questions.  Corey  Price, Pornhub’s Vice President, told Mashable, “Our goal is  to provide our visitors with a site that has credible and insightful  information, rather than have them scouring the internet.” While it’s a database they’ll build up over time, a first look  reveals they’ve started with the fundamentals — with answers to things  like “Babies. Where do they come from?” and “Are there really three  holes?”  These might seems almost laughably basic to adult consumers of  hardcore porn, but there are a lot of young people for whom these are  very real questions.  Price told Mashable they weren’t aiming the content  specifically at beginners.  He said they simply want to appeal to “those  who are looking for trustworthy sex tips and health advice provided by  experts.”  But it seems like they realize this could prove to be an  especially valuable resource for their younger audience, who most likely  isn’t getting comprehensive (much less sex-positive) sex ed in schools. There are, of course, plenty of online sexual health and education  resources, but for many kids, landing on sites like Pornhub is already  their way into learning about sex.  Porn can obviously teach you plenty  about the basics and mechanics of intercourse, but there’s a whole range  of other things — biology, health, consent, relating to intimate  partners, just to name a few — that you won’t pick up from watching  videos like “Big tits round asses” or “Sloppy throat games.”  So if they can slide their curious audience over to the PSHC while  they’re already on the site, it could function as pretty useful one-stop  shop for filling in the blanks left by spotty sex ed classes and the  birds and bees talks given by often bewildered parents.   Neat!  Holy shit their section on trans people was actually really good and not what I expected from something hosted by a porn site! If they had a containing various sexualities and whatnot as well, they’ll definitely have a good resource on their hands!  when a god damn porn site has better information about trans health than most school systems  " False link
