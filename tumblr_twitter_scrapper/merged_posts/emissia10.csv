Then some people started pointing them out, and I panicked and blurred that part of the bigger photo. However, since other fans moved faster than I did, zoomed-in edits of my photo are still going around. Stopping the further circulation of this image is important because someone at Studio Mir could get in serious trouble for not policing my photography enough. I do not want anyone to get in trouble just because of a fan’s huge mistake. Please delete it. " False text

Like, bitch, you say you want your information to be imported into a giant fucking ship but you can’t remember this???
