As of now, fans do not need to feel restless since  the other four members apparently decide to give out their music  respectively. A couple of days ago, BIG BANG Daesung has started such  step by releasing a mini album.BIG BANG Daesung issued a Japanese mini album “D-Day” on March 28. According to Soompi,  shortly after the release, it immediately climbed its way up on Japan  iTunes chart. At the same time, this album managed to take the first  place in album charts on Mora and Mu-mo. Promptly, the title song  “D-Day” also won the top spot within the real-time single chart for the  same digital music service.This Japanese second album of BIG BANG Daesung which consists of  seven tracks is produced by Motohiro Hata, Ikimono-Gakari’s Yoshiko  Mizuno, and Ayaka. Thus as well, Daesung also directly involved in  wrapping up this project. Moreover, “D-Day” album features the more  mature side of the “Look At Me, Gwisoon” singer. Accordingly, fans can  expect him pulling off sexiness for the seven songs.Upon issuing this album, BIG BANG Daesung is flooded by his big fans’ support. Per AllKpop,  his fans in Korea casted their support on Twitter by bringing upward  hashtag for Daesung to trending topic. On top of that, the global fans  were all also glad for this happy news. They then jointly carry on to  sign #D-Day on their Twitter post that day.Coming after this happy occasion, BIG BANG Daesung will hold “D-LITE  Japan Dome Tour 2017”. This occasion marks Daesung as the second Korean  singer, following fellow member G-Dragon, to put up a dome tour. The BIG  BANG singer will kick off the tour on Apr. 15 and 16 at the Seibu  Prince Dome. Furthermore, he will move on to other three domes located  in two cities.

They Live is an American satirical science fiction action horror film released in 1988. The story is set in LA. The main character, John Nada, finds a box of sunglasses and keep one pair before hiding the box. When he puts the sunglasses, he discovers a black & white world revealing advertising and media actually hide subliminal messages (source: Wikipedia). Nada sees through the sunglasses that most of wealthy people are actually aliens with skeleton face (gosh, those aliens are so creepy). And now, about the reference in SOBER MV, it is actually what money looks like in the black & white world: pieces of paper with “THIS IS YOUR GOD” on it. In SOBER MV, we can see that BigBang are in two worlds: a green natural environment, in which Seungri throws bank notes, and an empty white world, in which bank notes are substituted by the pieces of paper with “THIS IS YOUR GOD” on it. Voilà, that’s pretty much what I noticed, I’m too lazy to make a deeper analysis. This is for those who didn’t know.  Basically this fact stimulates what the whole Sober MV is standing on, it’s about what is the world made of, reality, dreams, imagination, which each person can choose where to live (i.e artists usually tend to live in their imagination to bring it to reality as paintings/illustration/music/etc) the white world is the reality as we all know, and the green natural environment is the imagination/dreams and we all know the song itself titled Sober as in being aware of the reality, and being the opposite (drunk/numb/day dreaming/even sleeping/etc) is bringing the dreams and imagination noting that wherever there’s smoke, means they’re dreaming as it’s fueling their imagination _______ Jiyong trapped in a closet with one bed smelling a few roses > field  full of beds and him jumping and being with the one he loves Stop acting like you’re all that You’re actually the most patheticIt’s hard for me to be sober I can’t do anything I hate being sober I can’t fall asleep without you (this part is like so straightforward, he can’t be with the one he loves if he was in the real world) _______ Daesung playing on imaginary drums > playing on actual drums Time is so damn slow, I’m just growing old, I live like I’m dead I have so many damn things to do but I have nothing that I want to do(metaphor which he portrayed them as he always wanted to play the drums but never got them, only in his dreams) _______ YB tripping and falling > running in a field sitting in a weird colorful car (also the glass cage one can be like sth blocking his imagination or dreams cuz he’s clearly in his dreams but can’t get to them ‘save me’) Hey doctor doctor, please save me Because I’m about to go insane/Hey TAXI TAXI, take me away Because this place is too hard to be in(save him and take him from reality, these are some of the best lines imo) _______ Seungri counting the ‘money’ where it says ‘this is your god’ and trying to catch them because this is the reality > throwing away actual money and that never happens in reality as if money doesn’t/shouldn’t matter If you only chase after money, power and fame Your crotch is gonna rip and you’re gonna fall(no need for explanation really, “don’t let the money control you”) _______ TOP jumping around on the floor with a horse toy > in a field with an actual living animal and super powers The world is cold to me People’s eyes are prickling on me I seem like an adult but I’m really a child that’s really tall My young dreams are just faded fantasies(it’s literally what TOP is doing in the mv, letting loose without anyone judging him)/People don’t understand me So I just wanna lose it without even knowing(even top himself said many times how people don’t get him/think he’s awkward why he acts as a kid)/I’m like Popeye without spinach(in reality he’s a superman without super powers) ____ At the end we see them all together in the field running after the smoke as if they’re holding into their dreams, first u see them running as if every and each one of them was in their own reality and now they broke free (cuz they’re still in the cloths of their reality where they were trapped) " False text
