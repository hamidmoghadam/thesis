A local rabbi has galvanized synagogues and organized groups throughout the city to form “rings of peace” around mosques during Islamic mid-day prayer services. The peace rings are among many rallies and other community-based efforts to reach out to Canadian Muslims in the wake of Sunday’s massacre at a mosque in Quebec City. A 27-year-old Quebec university student, Alexandre Bissonnette, allegedly opened fire during evening prayers at the mosque, killing six men and triggering heightened anxiety at religious institutions across the country. Yael Splansky, senior rabbi at Toronto’s Holy Blossom Temple, said she hopes the “rings of peace” may help dispel some of that fear. “No Canadian should be afraid to go to their house of worship to pray,” Splansky said in an interview. “It’s a terrifying scene. Imagine people of faith going to pray in peace, to pray for peace, and to be at risk. Houses of worship are sacred and must be protected.” Splansky said the Toronto peace rings were inspired by past events in Europe. Attacks against Jewish religious institutions in France and Norway prompted Muslims to form a protective ring around an Oslo synagogue in 2015 and stand guard while Jews offered sabbath prayers.

In case you’re wondering, me and Eleanor once lived within walking distance of each other and had met on many occasions. In fact, during her days with Louis, when she was a student and I was a celeb loving YouTuber and a showbiz radio reporter, we’d even shared a drunken gossip about his boyband tales, giggled about the other 1D girlfriends and genuinely had a pleasant time. As we then chatted and caught up by The Boundary restaurant in East London, my attention turned to a particular glum looking Sophia Smith, the ex girlfriend of Liam Payne, who was by her side. ‘How are you?’ I asked, while we discussed the fact that just hours prior her boybander ex had confirmed his romance with none other than Cheryl with the most surprising showbiz selfie of the year. We then proceeded to have a friendly chat about Cheryl and Liam and how their romance was captivating the whole country. Sophia branded the new couple ‘so weird,’ and shared various other thoughts on them, that you can read in this week’s Now magazine. And as I promoted the exclusive chat online on Monday night (7 March), Sophia’s sister, Zoe, publicly slammed me on social media while Eleanor quickly denied the whole thing. " False link
