I can figure some on my own and I’ve heard the blue cabinet before but I’d love to have them all neatly in a post! Tack så mycket     Walking like cats around hot porrige (Går som katter kring het gröt) - Basically the same as “beating around the bush” in English.  Give the iron (Ge järnet) - To give something all you’ve got, to go all in.  Sensing owls in the moss ([Jag] Anar ugglor i mossen) - To sense that something isn’t how it’s supposed to be.  That’s the dot over “i” (Det är pricken över “i”) - Basically the same as “that’s the icing on the cake” in English.  Feel python (Må pyton) - To feel really sick, to feel really bad.  That old man does not walk (Den gubben går inte) - “That won’t work”, “you can’t fool me”.  Nail sober (Spiknykter) - Completely sober.  Now there will be other buns (Nu blir det andra bullar) - Basically saying “things will be different from now on”, in the sense that there will be more hard work / stricter rules than before from now on.  He has put his last potato (Han har satt sin sista potatis) - Basically “he has used up his last chance”. Something that can be said when someone gets caught stealing and won’t be forgiven for it, for example.  Now you’ve crapped in the blue cabinet (Nu har du skitit i det blåa skåpet) - To have majorly fucked something up and gotten caught doing so. To have made a fool of yourself, to have gone too far.  It fell on the lip (Det föll på läppen) - To have something be liked very much. (”That show I recommended really fell on your lip, huh? You’re basically obsessed with it now.”) " False text
