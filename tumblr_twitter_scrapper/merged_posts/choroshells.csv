Medic Did his undergrad in cell biology.  He has the worst study habits known to humankind. He procrastinates. Pulls all-nighters two nights in a row, then crashes on the floor of his dorm common area.  If the material for a certain class is interesting, he’ll go waaaay beyond what’s expected of him. Read the textbook sections that aren’t assigned. Sit in the front row of class and ask questions that stump the professor. He’ll stretch a two-minute summary presentation into fifteen minutes.  If the material for a class isn’t interesting, he can barely force himself to work on it. Homework isn’t in by the deadline, and he’s winged quite a few tests with no studying at all.  Also, being a bio major, Medic is slave laborer volunteer in one the cell bio labs. The undergrad peons are tasked with feeding the cells in the middle of the night, so he frequently studies in the lab break room. He’ll kick his shoes off, throw books and papers everywhere, and erase the common blackboard so he can draw his own anatomy diagrams and dove doodles.  When it comes time to feed the cells, he’ll pad across the lab in his socks. The PI knows Ludwig is a walking safety violation, but hey, the kid is really good at keeping the cells alive.  When Medic’s grades come out, he’s earned a mixture of A+’s and D-‘s.  Only reason he got accepted to med school was because his name was on several scientific papers before he finished undergrad. Always give authorship to the guy who keeps the cells alive.  Engie Electrical engineering undergrad.  Dell is that one guy who grasps very abstract concepts very quickly. (“Well, of course adiabatic compression causes temperature increase.” And he understands fugacity.) He’s really good at thermo. Fight me.  All of his classmates would hate him if he weren’t so willing to help everybody else. He does it partially out of niceness, partially to show off, and partially because explaining concepts helps him learn.  For finals week, Dell and a friend or five will camp out in one of those group study rooms that have blackboards. They’ll settle down with coffee and a box of doughnuts or something and just crank out practice problems. Groups study sessions are loud. Lots of talking and arguing about theory and approaches. Occasional tears.  The janitor has to kick them out every night. It’s probably a good thing. Dell is not Ludwig – he’s never pulled an all-nighter in his life, and when he doesn’t sleep, he doesn’t function.  Heavy Did his undergrad in literature.  He’s the most serious student you’ve ever seen. Going to college is a great opportunity, and he’s very lucky to be here. And damnit. He. Will. Not. Screw. It. Up.  Anyway, because of the nature of his degree, he has more final projects than final exams. Misha starts his projects the day they’re assigned. All his books have annotations in the margins; they’re so well-thumbed that the bindings are starting to fail. He goes to every office hour every week, asking the professor to give his draft a looksee. (“For the umpteenth time, it’s fine, just write the final draft already.) The biggest fault with his writing is his tendency to pander to what the professor wants to hear. He wants good grades so badly that he’ll forget about himself in the process. The professors have had to give him a loving kick in the pants now and again. Tell him it’s okay to disagree with them.  Misha’s been known to get over 100% in some of his classes because he went to all the extra-credit poetry readings.  It goes without saying that he got into graduate school without trouble.  Demo I like to think that Demo tried college, but never completed it. Entering a formal classroom setting after a lifetime of homeschooling is rough enough. And it’s been shown pretty clearly that Demo’s coping skills are… not the greatest. Because I am a cruel and terrible person, I hc him as suffering from crippling test anxiety.  And let’s face it, testing environments can suck. Being stuffed in an enormous lecture hall with a “desk” that’s smaller than an 8.5x11 sheet of paper, listening to the sniffles of a hundred other students, not being allowed to use the bathroom while the florescent lights flicker overhead…Tavish will choke. He can’t focus on the problems because he’s panicking so hard. And then he’ll look up, realize he has fifteen minutes left and scribble down some sort of nonsense synthesis because he has to write something.  Anyway, he failed his finals for Principals of Chem and Orgo I. That locked him out of being any sort of chemistry major. His advisor recommended he transfer to the humanities, which Tavish interpreted as a major slap in the face. He didn’t return for a second semester.  Interestingly enough, he aced the practical portion of the Orgo I final. He had four lab periods to identify a completely unknown chemical, but got it done in a period and a half. Pop that sucker in the IR, do a functional group test for confirmation, and he’s golden. He also got a copy of the Sigma-Aldritch catalog from his mom and used that to compare spectra.  " False text

Even if you do everything right if you bind consistently over long periods of time then you’re almost definitely going to fuck up your back a little and reduce your lung capacity.  Your mental health is a part of your health, too, and it’s OKAY if you have to make the need to reduce your daily dysphoria your #1 priority BUT everyone really needs to stop talking about binding as if it has no impact on the body if done correctly. It encourages people who don’t need to do it to do it anyway even though it could harm them and it implicitly blames those with binding related injuries for not just “doing it right.”  I was an athlete before I started binding regularly. Now I can’t breathe as deeply as I used to be able to, and any strenuous movement causes pain my my shoulders and chest. No one told me that even proper binding could result in injury, and even though I never played or worked out while binding, I still had to quit. I just wish we could have an honest conversation about the health risks associated with transition without it being viewed as an attack on trans people.  @teratomarty, I’d be interested to hear your thoughts on this?

It is amazing the amount of time and care that is put into writing each chapter just so other people can read their work for free.

First of all, in a sexual species, you can have females be XX and males be X (insects), you can have females be ZW and males be ZZ (birds), you can have females be females because they developed in a warm environment and males be males because they developed in a cool environment (reptiles), you can have females be females because they lost a penis sword fighting contest (some flatworms), you can have males be males because they were born female, but changed sexes because the only male in their group died (parrotfish and clownfish), you can have males look and act like females because they are trying to get close enough to actual females to mate with them (cuttlefish, bluegills, others), or you can be one of thousands of sexes (slime mold, some mushrooms.) Oh, did you mean humans? Oh ok then. You can be male because you were born female, but you have 5-alphareductase deficiency and so you grew a penis at age 12. You can be female because you have an X and a Y chromosome but you are insensitive to androgens, and so you have a female body. You can be female because you have an X and a Y chromosome but your Y is missing the SRY gene, and so you have a female body. You can be male because you have two X chromosomes, but one of your X’s HAS an SRY gene, and so you have a male body. You can be male because you have two X chromosomes- but also a Y. You can be female because you have only one X chromosome at all. And you can be male because you have two X chromosomes, but your heart and brain are male. And vice - effing - versa.

I had to give a ten minute presentation on gender and a) how it’s different from sex, and b) whether or not there’s such thing as a “male” and “female” brain. I found COUNTLESS studies supporting the idea that the brain itself is unisex- there is very little, if any, difference between “male” and “female” brains, with one exception. I’m by no means a neuroscientist but this is what I understood from this particular article: there’s this tiny part of the hypothalamus (a small part of the brain) that has neutrons in it, and the number of neutrons varies. HOWEVER, when the brains of cis men and women and trans men and women (who had not taken hormones for years prior to the time of death) were studied, it was found that the cis men and trans men had almost identical average neutron counts, and the cis women and trans women had almost identical average neutron counts. So if you’re DMAB but realize at some point that you’re a trans woman, as far as your brain is concerned, you ARE a woman! The same goes for DFAB trans men (intersex/nonbinary individuals weren’t studied, unfortunately). TLDR; Your brain doesn’t care what you were “born as”, only what you really are!  I’m currently reading a fantastic book that goes through and debunks old studies that “find evidence” to support gender roles. SPOILER ALERT: they were all poorly done studies and their evidence is unsupported bullshit. " False link

While  Donald Trump is a bumbling political idiot, Mike Pence is actively  against the people and possibilities that we need to help America to  have a strong future. His career has been built on hateful exclusion,  not intelligent inclusion. Here are some things that every voter should know about Mike Pence: - Science and invention helped build America, but Mike Pence is 100% anti-science.  He chooses not to accept the preponderance of evidence that supports  anthropomorphic climate change, and he thinks schools should be required  to teach Christian “creationism” mythology alongside evolution in  science classrooms. - Mike Pence is anti-environment.  As governor, he has vetoed every piece of environmental regulation that  has crossed his desk. He doesn’t want the EPA to regulate greenhouse  gases, and he does want to open up pretty much every part of our country  to oil and coal companies. No more wildlands under Pence. He is one of  those irresponsible extremists who think that God gave us the world so  we could just use it up, and when it is all used up the second coming  will occur. There is no Biblical basis for this belief. - Females make up more than half of the American population, but Mike Pence is anti-woman.  He has said the Disney movie “Mulan,” which was based on a centuries  old Chinese poem, was the work of a “mischievous liberal” trying to  groom young children to accept women in combat. “Despite her delicate  features and voice, Disney expects us to believe that Mulan’s ingenuity  and courage were enough to carry her to military success on an equal  basis,” he wrote on his radio show’s website. - He obsessively pursues a personal vendetta to take Title X funding  away from Planned Parenthood because Planned Parenthood provides  abortion services. Title X money CANNOT be used for abortions. Abortions  are paid for by the recipient or through private, tagged donations.  Taking away Title X will not impact abortion services, but it would  leave thousands of women without access to cancer screenings or birth  control.  - Speaking of birth control, Mike Pence once again revealed his historical ignorance in saying that condoms are “modern” and “liberal.”   He thinks all women should be pregnant unless they can’t afford a baby,  in which case they should abstain from sex, even if they are married.  That’s right: sex is only for procreation in PenceWorld. If you can’t  afford the diapers, then hubby should be sleeping on the couch. - Mike Pence is also anti-gay,  to the point of denial. He doesn’t want the government to pay for  cancer screenings, but he does want the government to pay for abusive  “conversion therapy” programs that systematically undermine the victim’s  self-esteem, and then indoctrinate them into robotic gender-appropriate  behaviors. He has signed into law a bill that allows discrimination  against LGTBQ customers based on religious belief. - As governor of Indiana, Mike Pence was personally responsible for an outbreak of AIDS when he refused to allow clean needle exchanges for drug addicts. Instead, he asked people to pray for the addicts. - Mike Pence is racist.  He thinks there is “too much talk” about institutional racism in law  enforcement because “police officers are human beings.” His solution is  unity through “faith.” The Indiana governor has tried to prevent Syrian  refugees from settling in his state because the “pose a threat to safety  of residents.” Pence argued that his policy was based on fear, not  race, so it wasn’t discriminatory. A Federal Appeals Court dismissed his  racist arguments on October 3, 2016. - A Federal Court also had to block his bizarre anti-abortion law  that required burial or cremation for fetuses, whether miscarried or  aborted, no matter how far along the pregnancy had progressed.  - Mike Pence is pro-birth, but not pro-life.  He once funneled $3.5M dollars from Temporary Assistance to Needy  Families into programs that counsel against abortion. He wants those  women to have those babies, but he doesn’t care if the kids starve or  live on the streets afterward. - Mike Pence has refused to comply with federal guidelines aimed at reducing prison rape. When  you add it all together, you can see that the most dangerous part of  the Trump-Pence ticket is …that calculating quiet man who will be leading the charge from behind. Mike Pence is basically against anyone who is not white, conservative, Christian, and male. When  Mike Pence was a young lawyer on the rise, he challenged a longtime  Democratic congressman for a seat in a Republican-leaning Indiana  district. He seemed to have it in the bag until voters were stunned to  learn that he had been using political donations to pay personal  expenses including the mortgage on his house, his credit card bill,  groceries, golf tournament fees, and car payments for his wife.” http://www.smobserved.com/story/2016/10/10/opinion/mike-christian-sharia-pence-is-scarier-than-donald-trump/2081.html  FUCKING BOOST THIS IS SICKENING " False link

Creamed vegetables Baked beans Pickles Pork and beans Frozen veggies that come in packages featuring pasta, nuts, rice, cheese, or meats French fries and hash browns Sharp cheddar cheese, Swiss, and fresh mozzarella, shredded and sliced cheeses (except American cheese of course), cheese food, spreads, and products. Even Kosher cheese is banned unless you apply to get a specific check for it which basically could identify who the poor Jewish people are. (This is really gross and skeevy because of how this is isolating Jewish people and outing them.) Canned peas and green beans Albacore tuna, red salmon, and fish fillets Bagels, pita bread, English muffins White rice and wild rice Taco shells Almond, rice, goat, and soy milk. Brown eggs and any eggs produced by cage-free or free range chickens, which basically helps corporate chicken farms Several kinds of infant food Anything in bulk Anything organic or natural  here’s the list, for anyone who’s skeptical like i am. it’s on a real-ass government-ass website. i am, tbh, disgusted.  Thanks for the link. That is horrifying and disgusting.  The list is actually worse- no peanuts, SEASONINGS, SOUPS, any canned beans, WHITE RICE, anything organic or natural, and anything like lactose free/kosher milk, or anything that might be necessary to a religious group or someone with conditions such as celiac or lactose intolerance basically have to fill out forms which singles them out based on health/religious reasons.  This is really, really gross.   Is it just me or did they basically rule out basically all the cheapest and easiest to prepare food? Because that is bullshit.   WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK  I have food stamps in a different state and this list is essentially my grocery just when I go to the store. These are easy to prepare, quick, filling meals and most of them have a long shelf life and can be stored for emergencies or of you use up your food stamps before the end of the month. This is absolutely a blatant act of violence against poor families and I hope it continues to gain more national outrage.  Wait. What? How? Why? Huh?  They… They can’t buy potatoes?! Which has more potassium than a banana?! Or nuts?! Which are the best blend of magnesium, calcium, protein, and healthy fats that nature ever made?! I don’t… I don’t understand. There is no way this is concerned with poor people’s nutrition at all.  So what are they allowed to buy on food stamps?  Boiled air?  Interesting fact number one: Wisconsin is a state with a large number of Hmong immigrants, or people of Hmong descent.  I believe that only Minnesota has a larger Hmong population. Interesting fact number two: the first words that come up when I google for “Hmong cuisine” are these: “The Hmong staple food is white rice …”  How the fuck…can you deny the poor…rice and beans. Rice and beans are essential fucking staples for poor people. They can be bought in bulk. They are high in nutrition. They last a long fucking time.  Oh, but wait…THEY DON’T ALLOW POOR PEOPLE TO BUY IN BULK. What is their logic to this? Because all I see here is, “punishing poor people for being poor.” There is NO FUCKING REASON for this. Most of these items cannot remotely be considered ‘luxury.’ To ever deny the poor to buy CANNED or BULKED GOODS is just…mind-blowingly terrible. When I have money, I buy things in bulk for when I don’t…I just…what?!  How the hell do you make it illegal for poor people to buy food? This is so wrong and disgusting.  Given the number of extremely cheap items on the list it looks like a way to discourage people from even using food stamps and either scraping together money for food somehow, or relying on private charities. Is there any single fund or movement to supply food banks in Wisconsin with food specifically from that list in large amounts?    THIS IS BLATANT CLASS WARFARE AND EVERY DECENT HUMAN BEING SHOULD BE DISGUSTED BY IT.  Evil. " False link
