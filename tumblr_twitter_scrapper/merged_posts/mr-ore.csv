Fusion power is not by any means near. The comparison with a star is a bit misleading - both stars and tokamaks produce energy by nuclear fusion, but where stars are a dense cloud of hot gas held permanently together by gravity, tokamaks are a very thin plasma whirling around the core of a torus that dissipates as soon as the magnetic field collapses or the temperature drops. While the temperatures at the core of a tokamak sound astonishing, and they are, the actual amount of material held at this temperature is very small so the amount of energy in the plasma is not as large as you’d think. This article doesn’t discuss whether the EAST was able to produce more energy through fusion than was used to heat the plasma (not to mention the energy used to maintain the superconducting magnet coils). But if it had been able to do that, this would have been much bigger news. This is a very impressive technical achievement, but it doesn’t mean fusion is right around the corner. The running joke is that fusion energy is “always 30 years away” but indeed it’s already looking like more. Experimental fusion tokamaks have been operational for decades now. The ones I know most about are JET and MAST, which I got the chance to visit a few years ago - but we’re still a long way from generating net energy by fusion. That means that although nuclear fusion takes place in the tokamak, the energy produced by fusion is not enough to ‘break even’ and keep the plasma hot enough for fusion to keep going. ‘Breaking even’ is the objective of ITER, the enormous still-under-construction international collaboration to construct a tokamak that can generate more power than is put into it. (EAST from outside - source) So, like JET, EAST is a research project helping scientists and engineers understand the physics involved in building ITER and future fusion reactors, not a model for an electrical generator. While JET uses copper conductors to generate its containing magnetic field, EAST uses superconductors (ITER is also intended to use superconductors) - hence its name, the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak.  Superconductors - which have effectively no electrical resistance when  they’re kept below a certain temperature - have the advantage of  drastically reducing losses to heat from the enormous currents flowing  through the conductors and therefore allowing higher currents to be used  and stronger magnetic fields to be produced, but introduce the new  problem of keeping a superconductor at liquid nitrogen temperatures a  relatively tiny distance from a superheated plasma at a temperature of  millions of Kelvin (degrees C). One of the major objectives of EAST is  to test superconductor confinement of the kind intended to be used in  ITER.   EAST is a large tokamak but not the largest currently in operation, comparable to a number of experimental tokamaks in various countries. The above 2016 experiment is not the longest plasma pulse in a tokamak - that record is about 400s, currently held by the French tokamak Tore Supra, which also uses superconductors, and had a bit of a head start having been built in 1988. However, EAST is intended to create plasma pulses of up to 1000s, so maybe they’ll break that record. So this research is all very exciting. But fusion power stations are not just around the corner. Assuming the construction of ITER goes as planned, it will not begin plasma experiments until 2020, and fusion until 2027. But it’s already been delayed, and may well be delayed further. (the ITER building site - source) Once ITER is built successfully, it’s not a power station. It will take longer still for a demonstration fusion power station with the required parameters to be built. Termed DEMO, such a demonstration system was originally intended to begin fusion experiments in 2033, then this was pushed back to 2044 with power generation in 2047. A subsequent two ‘roadmaps’ were not written because the organisation responsible was ‘superseded’ by a different organisation, so it’s probably been delayed further. At least, its final design (let alone construction) is waiting on data from ITER. Once DEMO is built, though it will generate a fair chunk of energy, it’s still not the prototype for a first commercial power station. That’s nicknamed PROTO, and its design is even hazier. Even once a prototype power station is built and tested, the project of replacing a significant portion of the world’s power generation with fusion would take a long, long, long time. Long enough that it’s certainly not going to be much use as a climate change mitigation strategy. In the long term, if catastrophes don’t interrupt, fusion energy could be great. Fusion energy isn’t as messy as fission energy, nor as likely to cause a catastrophic accident (since if containment fails, the thin plasma simply dissipates, heating up the walls of the reactor but not producing loads of radioactive waste the way a fission plant does). But it does produce radioactive waste, since the plasma-facing surfaces of the reactor become irradiated. (Part of the fusion research programme is to identify plasma-facing materials whose activation products have a short half-life, so their radioactivity will be short-lived. There’s a plan to create a facility called the IMFIF to research this, and DEMO is supposed to use data from its research, but like ITER, it’s suffering delays.) That said, calling fusion energy renewable is strictly speaking incorrect - it relies on deuterium and tritium (isotopes of hydrogen). Deuterium can be produced from seawater, while tritium is planned to be produced using lithium in the reactor itself. ITER’s site claims that worldwide reserves of lithium would allow the use of reactors for “more than 1,000 years” from land and “millions of years” from sea, but I don’t know what assumptions go into that calculation. It is of course still a much longer-lasting supply than fossil fuels or fission. However, saying it’s totally greenhouse gas free is not true. Just like fission power plants, constructing fusion plants will require setting large amounts of concrete (though maybe not as much since the needs of radioactive containment are different). I’m not sure what the estimated lifetime emissions of a fusion plant are, but they won’t be nothing. Still, they should be better than fossil fuels, and probably will be better than fission energy. I’m also not sure how quickly lithium will need to be mined as the tritium source. That’s all very far in the future though - most likely most of us will not live to see a future of fusion power, and climate change is sufficiently urgent that we can’t afford to wait for fusion power to be invented before we drastically cut down fossil fuel production. Other renewables have different limitations - very high land use, the costs of construction, and managing fluctuating power on the grid - but they can deployed much sooner. But that will, of course, not happen on the scale needed under capitalism. " False link

Western propaganda draws from a deep well of racist “yellow peril” prejudice to stoke irrational fears against this tiny, poor, isolated country, and it amplifies this paranoia with long-standing stereotypes of East Asian “oddity” to dehumanize North Koreans and justify U.S. aggression against them.   The U.S. media, however, never provide this context and instead they present North Korean military propaganda as being unhinged and aggressive. They never compare this, of course, to U.S. military flyovers at sporting events or the ceremonial induction of new soldiers at halftime, or even to our National Anthem with its celebration of bombings and rockets and warfare. If North Korea is “crazy” for its militarism, then the United States is downright certifiable.   U.S. propaganda can dismiss North Korea’s legitimate concerns so easily because of the underlying racist assumption that these are a bizarre and simple-minded people that believe in things like unicorns. This feeds off of and into orientalist logic that sees East Asians as a nearly subhuman “other” that can’t be reasoned with and so must be handled with force. It worked when we needed to justify violence against immigrant laborers in the 19th century and it works to justify our imperialist expansion today. " False link

Photos that were too graphic to publish showed a huge fire raging next to bodies, including those of children, scattered on the ground next to charred buses with blown-out windows. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, with Shias targeted predominantly by Isis and, to a lesser extent, al-Qaeda in the past. Reports by Syrian state media that the car bomb had infiltrated the area after being loaded with food supplies for children could not be confirmed. The victims are believed to be from the pro-government villages of Foua and Kefraya, who had been starving under a siege by Islamist rebels.  They were being guarded by fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked alliance Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, whose members were also killed in the blast. They were allowed to leave the area in the “four towns” deal struck between rebels and Bashar al-Assad’s government, which allowed thousands of people to leave the pro-rebel areas of Madaya and Zabadani, where residents had also been starving. The United Nations described the situation as “catastrophic”, saying more than 64,000 civilians were “trapped in a cycle of daily violence and deprivation”. " False link

Long story short: the world-famous university of iowa creative writing program was established as a CIA front whose sole purpose was to create a literary movement that was supportive of capitalism. it was part of a greater feat of social engineering called Operation Mockingbird, wherein the CIA would either invent programs like Iowa creative writing, take over existing ones like Washington Post or CBS news, or create literary journals and magazines devoted to state capitalist propaganda.  A good quote from the long article to sort of summarize the ideology engineered by these MFAs: One can easily trace the genealogy from the critical writings of Trilling and Ransom at the beginning of the Cold War to creative-writing handbooks and methods then and since. The discipline of creative writing was effectively born in the 1950s. Imperial prosperity gave rise to it, postwar anxieties shaped it. “Science,” Ransom argued in The World’s Body, “gratifies a rational or practical impulse and exhibits the minimum of perception. Art gratifies a perceptual impulse and exhibits the minimum of reason.” In The Liberal Imagination, Trilling celebrated Hemingway and Faulkner for being “intensely at work upon the recalcitrant stuff of life.” Life was recalcitrant because it resisted our best efforts to reduce it to intellectual abstractions, to ideas, to ideologies.  Basically it was a Walt Whitman-esque, Ameri-typical shift towards the individual story about FEELING and the real experience over the intellectual, the political, the reflective, or the critical, contextualized through liberal supposedly anti-fascist/anti-bureaucratic reactions to WWII and the USSR.  Funded by the CIA, Rockefeller Foundation, etc.; not only took over popular rhetoric about how to write American fiction, but also specifically targeted foreign nationals to come write for the program and propagate this “imaginative, creative” America.  Hallmark styles sanctioned by (though not created by) this approach include modernism, lite literary fiction, and magical realism (though, I’d argue, not exactly the Márquezian variety, definitely the more watered down modern versions).  An example the author was taught is a pyramid diagram with “Meaning, Sense, Clarity” at the bottom and thus the most principal; then “Senses,” then “Character,” then the ‘fancy stuff’: metaphor, symbolism, allegory, i.e. the theoretical and critical.   @guavapaste ummm holy shit?!

The Russian newspaper says it confirmed the news with government officials and an analyst of the region also confirmed the news to the Times with her own sources. Three men are known to have been murdered, although the real number is likely to be higher.  in almost every genocide, the first “act” is the rounding up and killing of a group of men, specifically.  In “root and branch” genocides they [”civilian men of ‘battle age’”] are often the first group to be separated out and massacred, paving the way for the murder of women, children, and elderly men. In more common articulations of genocide, however, they can be the only group slated for outright massacre, while women, children, and elderly men suffer a range of alternative fates involving rape, sexual exploitation, torture, forced maternity, murder, and expulsion. Gender and the Future of Genocide Studies and Prevention   as the rest of this article explains this isn’t to say that men have it worst in a genocide, but that it’s important when you see a very common red flag for genocide to pay attention to the “conflict” in case any more markers of an impending genocide occur.  the g word is really loaded and i’m not bringing this up because i want to start an avalanche of “CHECHNYA IS COMMITTING GENOCIDE AGAINST GAY PEOPLE” fear mongering (that is the absolute last thing that i want). it’s just not possible to prevent any genocide without questioning whether a current conflict might eventually get there. and i do not think it’s nothing that genocide watch is reporting on this.  UPDATE 4/10/17 Chechnya has opened concentration camps for gay men   Gay men arrested in a ‘purge’ in the Russian region of Chechnya are being held in concentration camp-style prisons, reports have alleged. Early reports emerged earlier this month that gay people are being targeted in the region, which is part of Russia but has substantial autonomy. Russian newspapers and human rights groups report that more than 100 gay men have been detained “in connection with their non-traditional sexual orientation, or suspicion of such” as part of a purge. Several people were also reportedly feared dead following violent raids. In a chilling response, a Chechen government spokesperson denied that there are any gay people to detain, insisting that “you can’t detain and harass someone who doesn’t exist in the republic”. The Kremlin denied any knowledge of a purge. But reports have since emerged that the men arrested are being kept in horrific concentration camp prisons, where violent abuse and torture is common. Based on interviews with eyewitnesses and survivors, Novaya Gazeta reports that a secret prison has been set up in the town of Argun to detain the men arrested in the purge. One man who was released from the camp told the newspaper that he was subjected to violent “interrogations” at the camp, as Chechen officials attempted to get him to confess the names and locations of more gay men. The officials also seized his mobile phone, targeting his network of contacts regardless of whether they were gay or not. The camp was reportedly set up by Chechen forces in a former military headquarters in the town. The newspaper reports allegations that the Speaker of the Parliament of Chechnya was among officials to visit the site, though the claims have not been substantiated. The detainees face electric shock torture and violent beatings, while some of them have been held to ransom and used to extort their families. Tanya Lokshina of Human Rights Watch wrote: “For several weeks now, a brutal campaign against LGBT people has been sweeping through Chechnya. She continued: “Law enforcement and security agency officials under control of the ruthless head of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, have rounded up dozens of men on suspicion of being gay, torturing and humiliating the victims. “Some of the men have forcibly disappeared. Others were returned to their families barely alive from beatings. At least three men apparently have died since this brutal campaign began.” She added: “These days, very few people in Chechnya dare speak to human rights monitors or journalists even anonymously because the climate of fear is overwhelming and people have been largely intimidated into silence. “Filing an official complaint against local security officials is extremely dangerous, as retaliation by local authorities is practically inevitable. “It is difficult to overstate just how vulnerable LGBT people are in Chechnya, where homophobia is intense and rampant. “LGBT people are in danger not only of persecution by the authorities but also of falling victim to ‘honour killings’ by their own relatives for tarnishing family honour.” What Can We Do?   Alexander Artmyev from Amnesty International spoke to Metro.co.uk. He said that people who are not in Russia can help by joining the charity’s Urgent Action on Chechnya. The action encourages people to write in Russian or your own language to Chairman of the Investigation Committee and Acting Head of the Investigation Committee for the Chechen Republic. Amnesty has also asked the letter, which should ask for an investigation and appeal for protection for LGBT individuals, to be copied into Human Rights groups and diplomatic missions from your country.
