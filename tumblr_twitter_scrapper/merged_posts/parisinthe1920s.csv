He was feeling particularly proud of himself. He had managed to leave his last class – a dull French lesson – well in advantage, granting himself a few small pleasures that only twenty minutes of calm and solitude could offer. He had been able to set his books back into his locker without the annoying buzz of people hungry for his attention, to fix his hair and his suit properly inside of the empty bathroom and eventually to text his dad to meet him in front of the building. Indeed, the excuse he had uttered to his teacher, astonishing her with his fluent French and pristine pronounce, wasn’t completely false. As his mother used to say, the best built lies were those who had a ground of truth; it was perfectly credible for Henry to justify his need to leave earlier by claiming that his father had been forced to move up their appointment, for he was obviously and exceptionally busy man. Though the absolute urgency he had talked about was a mere product of his persuasion, he was actually supposed to meet his father, who had told him that morning before leaving for work that he had something important to tell him. While this reason wouldn’t have been enough to allow any other student to skip part of a lesson, no one had the guts to risk to bother the Bass family. Keep reading " False text

And, talking about him in general, I can’t help but agree; other than being a naturally selfish person, Chuck was raised in an environment that encouraged him to see “the world” as something he was destined to “own” and, also, to seek power through an always greedy ambition. This view of life doesn’t seem to leave much space for other people’s needs. Yes, surprisingly, Chuck has often put Blair’s needs – and, overall, his loved ones’ needs – before his own. And her happiness.  Contrary to Blair, who has a dreamy and romantic side, before falling in love Chuck has never valued happiness; his cynic way to see life kept him from thinking that it was important, or, as a matter of fact, possible (“Happiness is not on the menu,” he says in the pilot and there’s no sadness in his words, only bitter irony and not so vague mockery). I’d say he considered it a naïve illusion at best, something really far from the coldly realistic and corrupted world his eyes could see – and understand.  Blair overturned his concept of happiness. Although, looking at the bigger picture, Chuck kept a sceptic detachment towards the general idea of happiness, she made him see that it was possible to be happy by her side, or, better, that happiness was conceivable because of her.  In other words, she irremediably became his reason to be happy. It’s important to underline the fact the Blair was the first person who loved Chuck unconditionally; as brave as she is, she broke through the walls he had built to keep everyone from seeing his fragility – which he considers unacceptable – and reached his core. She was the first person who saw him as a whole and who accepted him a whole. This kind of unconditional love – that is almost maternal – is what allowed Chuck to trust her. She managed to bring him to show her his weaknesses and to let her understand him in a profound and total way. Blair’s acceptance, and all of its implications, was in many ways the key to Chuck’s happiness: his chance to feel loved, safe and comprehended in an emphatic way, that went beyond his often paralyzing fear of showing emotions.  From the moment he gave her his heart, Chuck has been sure of the fact that she was his only possibility of happiness. She was the one, the only one he could foresee a future with and, also, his balance. But it hasn’t always been clear to him that he could be the same for her.  For a long time Chuck has thought about himself as unworthy of Blair and her love. He wasn’t simply scared of hurting her, he was also scared of not being the right person for her. On a deeper level, Chuck is an incredibly insecure person; although the façade he presents to the world is a portrayal of arrogance, self-importance and carelessness (and these are all things that Chuck is, and not just a cover), at the same time he has a terrible view of himself. Feeling unworthy is something that has been a constant in his life. The reasons behind this self-loathing are many and it would take another essay to explain them all, but in general it’s safe to say that, at least till some point, Chuck feels a certain sense of “resignation” towards himself; he can’t be better than the “failure” he thinks he is and he can’t overcome this sense of inferiority he has, especially when it comes to Blair.    If in earlier seasons this feeling of unworthiness mixed with a lack of courage (I’m thinking about 2X23 and how Chuck let Blair go, convinced that he couldn’t make her happy), later, after all the hurtful mistakes he made and the pain he knows he caused her, it becomes – at least from his point of view – pure awareness.                       Season four finale is possibly my favorite season finale. It’s heartbreaking and beautiful, poetic in a tragic way. Chuck’s greatest fear, that thought that has always haunted him, becomes true through Blair’s words: he knows for sure he can’t make her happy, because she tells him so. Chuck, a deeply damaged and fragile character, doesn’t have the means to understand the nature of her words. The happiness Blair is talking about would be more accurately described with “lightness”; it’s happiness seen only on the surface, it’s a juvenile happiness, that has a little to do with the depth of Chuck and Blair’s love. Chuck can make Blair happy, but that light serenity isn’t all he can give her. And, from this point, Blair will follow a journey that will lead her to understand that no one can and that light and darkness are both part of life and that pain is an inevitable part of love. But Chuck doesn’t know – he can’t know. And he can’t stand the idea of not being able to make Blair happy, because her happiness is what he values the most. It’s, at this point, his priority. His love for her, in this circumstance and in many others, is heartbreakingly selfless; he is willing to give up on his own happiness (as I said, Chuck knows he could only be happy with her ) so that she can be happy with someone else. Actually, it’s even deeper than this: in this moment, Chuck is giving up on himself. When watching their goodbye scene in 4X22, you have to keep in mind the fact that Chuck does not know how to be himself without Blair. Blair, the person who loved him and took care of him, is his reason to be “Chuck Bass”. It will be recurrent, in season 5, his feeling of emptiness (“I feel nothing”, “I have nothing”) and his struggle to live without her, to the point that he claims that he’s merely “surviving”, like an empty shell. In the moment he chooses to let Blair go, Chuck is painfully aware of all of this. Yet, he is ready to condemn himself to an unhappy, hollow life for the sake of Blair’s happiness.     " False text
parisinthe1920s 142143560752 "2016-04-02 22:40:25 GMT" http://parisinthe1920s.tumblr.com/post/142143560752/lets-talk-about-that-i-lost-my-true-self-but-i "nateschucks:  Blair has always wanted to run from herself. It’s all cool to call herself a bitch when it’s for show, and it’s basically a one liner. It’s okay to belittle people and bully everyone to be queen. It’s glamourous and Blair doesn’t seem to think further than that (and seriously the writers just love one liners that are absolutely stupid but that will go viral on the internet and make a character super popular, case in point, but that’s a talk for another day.) The thing is, some people were upset in season 6, because they felt Blair had grown up so much in season 5 (how?) and was going back to her old ways. The thing is, she never did. Oh, she wish she did, she managed to convince herself she did. But it was not growing up. She ran away from everything, tried to convince herself of what she needed. It was a huge mess. That whole thing with Louis? A mess. She was ready to dump him at the end of season 4. Chuck “convinced” her it was the right thing to do so she stayed. And it became her decision. She started defending it. But it was Chuck’s  logic, not her decision. She ran away a few episodes later, leaving Louis…. And then BAM back with Louis ready to get married… for all the wrong reasons again. Same goes with her relationship with Dan… He was there for her, was a good friend when she needed someone (and didn’t let anyone else be there… ) so, she decided to date him. Who cares who hurts? After all, Blair always cared for everyone’s feelings, she was always there for Serena or Chuck who were both selfish. So she apparently decided not to care anymore. Big time. (can we talk about the hotel thing becoming only about chuck and just being a running gag in the show or something? It’s being tossed around for no apparent reason, and it’s twisted differently every damn time. Sure I get how awful it was and how it must have left Blair feeling, but she made mistakes and she can’t pine everything on Chuck ‘I don’t  like who I became with you’, sure that wasn’t her brightest moment, and there were parts of their relationship that weren’t all pink, but you do not blame someone for who you are, she didn’t become anything, she spend the season plotting her way into college, it certainly wasn’t chuck who made her do it — she can’t blame that for everything anyway) It’s a lot like it was in season 2, with the loss of Yale. Only worse. She blames losing herself on Chuck and Louis in that particular quote. And I now she does so in another scene at least when she tells Dan she doesn’t want to be in his shadow (basically, because  I don’t know the exact words). But that’s not true. Just like Miss Carr (was that her name?) didn’t make her lose Yale in season 2. Sure events, and relationships, and people can break you, and make you hurt, and Blair was hurt badly by both Chuck and Louis…  but she hurt right back and was never only a victim. And Dan… this is what makes me the craziest about this. Dan and his pretty words that meant nothing. About the real Blair he discovered. So Dan decided, after spending some time with Blair, that the Blair he used to know from sschool wasn’t real. That she didn’t exist at all. But the thing is, Blair isn’t only a mean girl, but she remains a mean girl. Sure, it helps her deal with thing blah blah, but she likes money, and power, and games. She can be loving and vulnerable and she is cultured. But she’s also selfish and vengeful, and all the things Dan used to know about her. One part doesn’t erase the other. Just like Blair herself realizes in season 6, there is Grace Jones as well as Grace Kelly. And it is her personality, not something that needs to disappear, but something that needs to be used wisely. And in that particular episode, Dan lashed out at her pretty badly, again, because suddenly he wasn’t idealizing her (and he was right in what he said, but the judgmental tone that was here again just irked me) Dan supports all of Blair crazy ideas in season 5, but by supporting her, he’s not helping her. And at some point she realizes that she wants to be herself again, and that’s in 5x22 this time, and there’s no stupid monologues about the real Blair being super close and all that. At this point, she decides she just needs to scheme again. What is regarded by a part of the fandom by absolutely childish behaviour that needs to be erased, is what Blair wants to be herself again. And she struggles, but she asserts herself slowly. “I know what I want and I’m gonna get it”. This is a popular Blair quote, but I don’t think people see how important it is. Blair ran away from everything, her wedding, her relationship with Louis before that, Chuck, her miscarriage, her feelings altogether (that can be killed, or erased or whatever …  or so she says, that particular sentence clashing with what she tells Chuck in season 5, she tried… but failed, and now she’s back). She wanted nice, easy, what people told her was right. She thought royalty was the right way to do it, because fairytales are what people dream of (?!), she thought religion was going to help her because so many people say so, she thought she had to do something big to be herself again… something absolutely paradoxial since she was still running away without thinking. She thought Dan was perfect boyfriend material because he was a good friend, never mind that she had just gotten out of a marriage as well as a weird relationship that I can’t qualify at this point because all she did was drag Chuck along in all her madness… right till he snapped and told her A) That he wasn’t going to be waiting forever and B) (actually that’s the moment he snapped) that he didn’t want to ‘be mr Blair Waldorf’ — btw I was cheering at my laptop, because when Blair says she wants to be successful on her own everyone is happy and talks about how strong she is, but Chuck, who spent like a year trying to work on himself is supposed to accept all the bullshit Blair throws at him? I don’t think so— okay I’m rambling now. I don’t know what I was saying… Anyway, just in a few words, even if I lost many of my original thoughts along the way, I just hate that scene as much as Da*r. It’s beautiful words that have no meaning (of course there are things like that everywhere in teen shows… personaly, i’m still not over chuck and blair’s scene in 4x22, where they are talking bullshit; I’ll try analyzing that at some point. It promises to be fun, I’ll be torn between crying and laughing out loud, because of how nonsensical it gets). And that’s just a recurring theme in both Blair’s life, and the way Dan sees her. The facade that feel like the truth, I mean. He thinks HE knows Blair, so he writes about her, he idolizes her, and Blair loves it, because Blair wants to be flawless and loved. And then it turns out untrue, and Dan lashes out. (that scene in 6x01 where he tells her he loved her unconditionally, erm yeah sure. Okay. That’s just a big word thrown around. Eleanor, Serena or Chuck love Blair unconditionaly, Dan or her own father don’t. Dan thought Blair had changed (5x24), he wanted to, so he started believing it. Actually it’s mix of thinking she had changed and thinking what he used to see was totally untrue and just a mask, I guess. And in the end, he was disappointed because he didn’t know Blair. just like he was disappointed in his father, and in Jenny, Serena and Vanessa before that, because people aren’t what you believe them to be.  Don’t turn people into Mary Sues, thank you very much. People have flaws, and side you might not like. Everything that exists in a person is true. What you believe by yourself might not be, what is proven by actions is. Blair was right there yelling at people and scheming under Dan’s nose, and he was there judging her for it. This is true and valid, just not all that Blair was about. Let’s talk about her father now that I’m at it (or was a few seconds ago) ; She gets along with him easier that she does with Eleanor. But he doesn’t really know her. Because he’s never around, because she took her ‘bad’ side from Eleanor, and because she works hard to have him see her as a flawless person. So when she schemes against him in season 1, he’s just terribly surprised. And in season 2, he basically packs his bags and goes. Even refusing that she comes with him to the airport when he knows he’s not going to see her for a while after that. Eleanor, on the other hand, although she was an absentee mother and wasn’t the best person (she made Blair feel self-conscious etc..), always understood Blair. She couldn’t express her love in the right way, so it seemed to Blair that she was too harsh and unloving. But she understood and loved Blair. And in the end, they learn to really bond, and they have good moments.  Okay, I’m going to stop now. I could go on for a while about all of this, but I won’t. to sum up, for like the third time, in season 6, Blair actually discovered a lot about herself while trying to be a grow up. She realized what worked and what didn’t and how to behave and how far to go. She made mistakes but came out stronger, and that arc is very important, just like the last episode of the 5th season was for her. She’s really growing up, and thinking.Not because she says she wants to, or crying over her fate but because she’s trying to accomplish something. (and like not crying TOO MUCH because she still complains a lot while trying to do something good with WD). On her own. Her mistakes are her own, her achievements as well. (even if once again she wants to blame things on Serena, Nelly, Poppy or whomever else) Season 6 in underrated anyway; There was loads of shit in it, but there were still good, important things. I guess I can say the same thing for season 5…  " False text

First, he had come home from a trying day at Bass Industries. The constant distrust of the company’s board and shareholders was weighing him down.  The upcoming Bass Industries gala would be crucial in securing their trust as their new CEO. To add to the already troubling matters of his professional life, he knew his wife of six months was trying to find a suitable designer for her company. Blair was always talented, but he knew she preferred to be in control, taking command rather than putting the effort into designing herself. Her mother continued to push for her to hire Jenny Humphrey as her successor as the head designer and creative director for Waldorf Designs, while Blair would take the role of CEO–overseeing all operations and getting final approval of all the designs. Her mother would stay on as chairwoman of the board. He understood Blair’s reservations about hiring Jenny, given her history with the younger woman. He acknowledged that while she had forgiven him for his misdeed with Jenny and his many other mistakes, he wasn’t as certain she’d forgiven Jenny yet.   It was so long ago, and he believed the only way for them to move towards their future was to let go of the past.  That meant offering an olive branch, and letting bygones be bygones. He admitted he thought Jenny had potential as a designer; she could be a breath of fresh air for the company. Besides, Blair having authority over Jenny?  He knew Blair would relish that. He also knew there was a time when Blair had held a deep respect for Jenny Humphrey, wanting to train her as her protégé. Chuck always admired and worshiped Blair, like she was the most beautiful goddess he had ever gazed upon. This would never change.  His relationship with Blair held so much more substance than that, though, it was on a much deeper level. He always encouraged her and supported her. She did the same for him. He never felt an emotional connection with anyone the way he did with Blair.  It made him feel like he had become worthy of her love and devotion.  His wife taught him the meaning of love and what it meant to be loved in return, like his father should have. He’d never be more grateful towards her for that. She made him whole, she kept him together, and filled his heart with hope and fulfillment. Without her, he was sure he would crumble into oblivion, drinking away his sorrow and succumbing to darkness. She showed him what she saw in him: she had known there was something arcane about him, but she chose to believe that there was a beacon of light that radiated in him. It just took falling in love with her for it to be discovered. After Chuck and Blair had heard the argument between Jack and Georgina, they knew something had transpired between his coldhearted Uncle Jack and Georgina. Unlike Blair, however, he was not surprised. After all, like he and Blair, Jack and Georgina shared many paralleling qualities. It only surprised him they didn’t find each other sooner. That’s when the two scheming rapscallions decided they were going to bring their counterparts together, for better or for worse. Chuck and Blair felt that subtly guiding them together in the end was the least they could do. Jack and Georgina had helped them make it to the altar in one piece.  Chuck and Blair would have been suspected of Bart’s murder, questioned by the police, and maybe not even received their happily ever after. They owed Jack and Georgina this at the very least. To Chuck, it was beyond that. He wasn’t always his uncle’s biggest fan, but in these last two years, Jack really stepped up to help him.  He was the one that brought him and Blair together again, and Chuck discovered something about his uncle in the process. He saw there was some good in him, even in tiny doses, that was something worth fighting for.  In the past, Jack was driven by jealousy and revenge, but now he saw a side of his uncle he hadn’t been aware of. He saw a man with a fragile and broken heart, a heart that had been frozen by hatred and jealousy.  He came to the realization of the cause: Bart Bass. His latest discovery about his uncle didn’t exonerate or justify his actions towards him and Blair, but it gave Chuck a flicker of hope Jack could be saved and find happiness, something he wanted for his uncle. Maybe then Jack could finally be happy, and not try to absorb it from others. He was already forming a plan in his mind. All he would need was to get Jack and Georgina in the same room and get them to realize the fire blazing between them. Just as he pondered over the plan, he heard his door being swung open and his uncle came bolting in, like he owned the company instead of Chuck.  ""Chuck!“ his voice reverberated into the room. “Where are the documents that needed your signature to move forward with the hotel acquisition in Switzerland Read More  " False text

A/N: This collection of one-shots has been written as a Christmas gift to my dear Daphne. Her prompt was quite specific: she asked for a fanfiction portraying Chuck and Henry’s relationship during the first months of the youngest Bass’ life. I chose to follow the course of a year through six one-shots of different length. Reading, you’ll realize that they focus mainly on Chuck and his feelings, even when seen through other characters’ eyes. As I said this was a precise request, other than something that I really wanted to explore. I didn’t mean to underestimate motherhood and, consequentially, Blair’s role in her son’s life; it simply isn’t the main topic of these pieces. I also must say that I don’t have a deep knowledge of babies, which is why the fanfiction required a lot of researches. I tried to be as truthful as possible, reading up on each stage of babies’ growth and babies care as much as possible to be able to give a more detailed picture. Still, I might not have been perfectly accurate and I apologize in advance about possible inexactness. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions. If  you want, leave a review on ff.net!  July 7th, 2015 To the outside world, Chuck Bass was the picture of coldness and detachment. Emotions never seem to touch him; his dark, sharp eyes were always obscured by a veil of indifferent boredom and his lips hardly ever curved into a sincere smile, something different from the arrogant, self-satisfied smirk he notoriously faced life with. He was famous for having no qualms. People would have described him – whether with admiration or fear – as a merciless, intimidating man, and he surely would have welcomed such a portrayal of himself with barely contained satisfaction and pride. Though, behind the privacy of the walls of his townhouse, where he lived with his wife and son, he was a very different person. Genuine smiles and loving glances often showed on his face, revealing his most tender side and the happiness his heart was full of. There, in that place he liked to think of as his castle, he wasn’t The Great Chuck Bass and he wasn’t the threatening Mr. Bass: he was Chuck, sometimes Charles and, ever since nine months ago, he was daddy. As a daddy, the usually rigid, controlled man had even learnt that he could sit on the carpet of his son’s newly arranged and furnished playroom without cringing at the thought of crumpling the pastel blue trousers of his fine cotton summer suit.

He was accustomed to getting what he wanted right after he demanded it – or, better, most of the times, he expected people to predict his requests and grant them before he could bother to ask. The peculiar combination between being used to rule and being rather spoiled had indeed caused him to develop, ever since young age, a deep and passionate aversion to waiting – which was, according to his opinion, one of the many things that made him so successful. As a consequence, Chuck had grown to consider delay extremely offensive. Although his usually very rigid politeness softened into a certain flexibility when it came to conceding himself the pleasure of being awaited for (he was convinced that being slightly late contributed to adding a further air of importance to his already unapproachable persona), he did not tolerate such a behavior from other people. This imperative, however, didn’t apply to his wife. Blair was, as she was in almost every aspect of his life, an exception. She had always been able to bring out his most tenacious side; she was the one who had taught him the power of perseverance and the one person he didn’t mind awaiting. No matter how long, he knew he would have waited for her – and he would have done it with surprising patience. Keep reading " False text

Blair and Chuck. They had been married for over 48 hours and were finally settled in their hotel room. The bath was running and the candles were lit. They made the impulsive decision to run away to Paris for a few days because Blair couldn’t gather her head around the ‘love letter’ that Serena kept gushing about, and both of them wanted to spend some time alone before getting back to normal. Paris was the perfect choice for that. Unfortunately they couldn’t turn back time and go back to Paris in the 20s, but this would have to do. Blair sent Chuck off to buy her favorite pastries as she decided to stay in and order room service, and create a romantic setting. Sure, they couldn’t time travel back to the 1920s but that didn’t stop Blair from making their hotel room feel like Paris in the 1920s. La vie en rose reached Chuck’s ears as he entered the room and was met by what seemed hundred lit candles and a bed of roses. Blair had really out done herself however, Blair was nowhere to be seen. He found her lying in the tub, holding a glass of champagne. She reached for the second glass and handed it to him before forming a smirk on her lips, “what took you so long?” Not answering her question, he leaned in and pulled her in for a kiss. As the kiss went on, she began to remove his clothes. His mouth then found her neck and then moved to her ear and whispered “if you thought that was long, you have no idea what you’re in for.” She let out a moan and made a motion for him to hurry him and join her in the tub, and he did just that. … “I could live without you, you know?” Her words ended the silence and they confused him. He reached up to her chin, put his finger on it, and gently turned her head around to face him. “Am I supposed to find this romantic?” She leaned in for a soft kiss, her hand rested on his cheek. “Yes, you should.” “Then please enlighten me.” “I don’t want the kind of love that either saves you or kills you. The kind of love that you cannot live without. I’m Blair Waldorf, and I’m fine breathing without any man in my life; without you in my life. I survived through everything that I went through; that we went through – all the hurt and the lies, and the pain. I survived it. Here’s the thing Chuck – here comes the romantic part; I can live without you but I don’t want to. I choose you because I love you and because I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I think that’s more romantic than the “if I’m not with you I’ll die” kind of love.” Silence hit the room after her little speech and it continued until I don’t want this moment to ever end was heard, and with me by Sum 41 was playing. It was a drastic change from the other songs in the playlist.  The silence that was still lingering wasn’t there because he didn’t feel the same – it was because he didn’t know how to put his own thoughts into brilliant speeches like she could. No, Chuck knew how to express himself best with sex and that was just what he did. “I could live without you too, you know?” he said, referencing back to what she had told him just after they made love. She let out a laugh and her eyes gazed with his. “Am I supposed to find this romantic? If so, please do enlighten me.” “Well you see Waldorf, when I first fell for you I couldn’t live without you. I would literally die without you, and I almost did many times. I was selfish and it wasn’t fair of me to put my life in your hands. As time went by I realized that all I really wanted was for you to be happy with or without me, and I could live without you. I could live without you, knowing that you were happy. I can be Chuck Bass without you, but I don’t want to. “ “I guess that one can say that we chose each other.” Everything’s nothing without you. “Always.”  Chuck and Blair. Blair and Chuck. They had been through a lot over the years. It wasn’t always easy, and it wasn’t always love. It wasn’t always rainbows and butterflies, or la vie en rosé.  One thing was sure though, they loved each other. Always. In a million different universes and periods, and in Paris in the 1920s, they’d always choose each other. I won’t let this go. " False text
