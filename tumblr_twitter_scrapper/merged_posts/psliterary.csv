To celebrate Leslie’s giving away TEN copies! In this irresistible cozy mystery from the author of The Book Club Murders, amateur sleuth Charley Carpenter fights to avenge a crime that hits far too close to home.  Mulbridge House stood, silent and decaying, deep in the woods at the  heart of Oakwood, Ohio, long before the passing of Augusta Mulbridge.  Yet suddenly everyone in town seems to have a stake in its fate: the  greedy heirs, eager to tear it down for a tidy profit; the local  preservationists, determined to maintain it as an historic site; the  angry neighbors, staunchly opposed to the construction of a modern  subdivision. Even Charley Carpenter is forced to admit that her beloved  shop, Old Hat Vintage Fashions, could use an infusion of the estate’s  treasures. The clock is ticking. The wrecking ball is ready to  swing. All that stands between Mulbridge House and oblivion is one final  vote. That, and murder … The trouble begins when Charley  walks into auctioneer Calvin Prescott’s office to find her cherished  family friend crumpled on the floor. Detective Marcus Trenault quickly  connects his death to a string of increasingly violent burglaries  plaguing Oakwood. But when Charley uncovers a link to a massive land  swindle worth millions, not to mention a drug ring operating out of the  manor’s abandoned outbuildings, that theory crumbles faster than  Mulbridge House. Now Charley’s racing to catch a killer before everything falls apart. " True text

I decided to go into publishing for the usual reasons: books were  incredibly important to me growing up, and a huge comfort at many times  in my life. It always felt a bit magical to find the right book at the  right time, and when I realized that real people were involved in making  that magic happen, the decision to go into publishing seemed natural. I  first tried my hand at publicity because I’ve always preferred to work  with people and enjoy the selling aspect of the business, but it was  very much “end of the process” which I quickly realized was not a good  fit for me.Agenting, which is the complete opposite end of the process, seemed  like a natural alternative. And it turns out I love working with  projects I choose and believe in, and I really enjoy using my  negotiating skills as an advocate for authors. I was lucky enough to  assist at an agency that works with some of the top names in SF/F  fiction, which was just fantastic training with some really amazing  talent. Then I was ready to build my own list and well, here I am! What mistakes are you seeing most often in SF/F queries, and how can writers avoid them? I really think that SF/F queries are the most difficult ones to  write. The key (in my humble opinion) to any great query is of course  focusing on the character. It all falls apart without a concrete main  character to pin my emotions on. One mistake I often see is a query  that’s all about the elaborate magic system or the themes, but nothing  about why the conflict is personal for that main character/why I want to  read an entire book about them.But equally important in an SF/F query is showing what makes the world: 1. Interesting, and 2. Unique.The biggest problems I see in this area all come from a lack of  specificity. Vague phrases like “trouble looms” or “enemies surround  them” or “a dark past” or even “magical powers” can apply to almost any  book, which means your MS will sound boring [or] unoriginal and I won’t  feel the need to read it. The good, interesting bits are always in the  specifics.If you’re in doubt, try a three draft method. First, vaguely sketch  out the events you need to include in the query, keeping a decent  balance of character and world, ending at the initial conflict that  pushes the MC into the meat of the book. Then, go back and add as many  specific details as you can to replace any vague wording. (Why is there a  war? What are the powers? What trouble do they fear? Why do they care  about these people? Etc.) Lastly, go back and prune because you’ve  probably just written a monster of a query! Your best critiques are  going to come from people who have NOT read your manuscript (but who do  read in your genre).Read the full interview at Queership.com" True link

Most people, when faced with a messy disaster of a home, usually do one  of two things:1. Wait until it gets to the point of being completely unbearable and then clean everything in a whirlwind marathon and then consider it done; or2. Decide it’s all too overwhelming and just give up entirely, only cleaning things that are needed for immediate use and ignoring everything else because where do you even begin when everything is so terrible?Unfortunately,  neither one of those approaches is particularly effective or  sustainable. With marathon cleaning, your home ends up completely clean  for a very short period of time, and then the mess accumulates until you  reach your breaking point again. With avoidance, you never make any  progress, and you continue to be frustrated and overwhelmed by your home  all the time. But there is a better way. Rather than knocking yourself  out doing it all at once or pretending the mess isn’t there at all,  investing just a little bit of time every day (or, realistically, most  days) will get you to a clean home that you can actually enjoy much  faster than you’d think.“A 20/10 is 20 minutes of cleaning followed by a 10-minute break”Read the full article at HouseBeautiful.com" True link

First off, how long have you been an agent? What made you want to dive into this wacky business in the first place?I’ve been at it for two years as of… wow, as of just a week ago or so.I’d  spent a solid few years working at a publishing house in Philadelphia  (hi Quirk Books!), and while I adored every single minute of it, I  wanted to really work on my own projects. When the opportunity to agent  surfaced, with an agency that was on board for me to take on any wild  idea and just let me run with it, I jumped at the chance.It’s definitely a wacky business, but so extremely fulfilling. I love the book community.2. What genres do you represent? How important is the genre,  or will you take on something different just because it gives you the  feelings?I’m a little all over the place? Young Adult  across all genres… that’s where my heart is, absolutely. I’ve sold more  YA than anything else. But I also really love quirky and hard hitting  non-fiction, voice-driven sci-fi and fantasy, and cookbooks.Genre  is pretty important. Some stuff I just don’t quite get, because I don’t  read enough of it. For example, I don’t work on Middle Grade books,  because I simply haven’t read enough of it to feel confident that I’d  know what’s good. Same with say, commercial horror novels.Read the full interview in all its gif glory at FizzyFangirling.com " True link

Maybe a couple  of chapters. Hell, some agents are going to want you to paste those  first pages in an email.Chances are, if you’re a querying writer, you’ve already polished  these opening pages to perfection, pouring over them again and again.Which is great, but before I dig into talking about opening pages…  make sure the rest of your manuscript is as polished as those early  chapters.Done? Okay. Let’s continue.Now, everything I’m about to prattle on about here is subjective.  Remember that, writers. When it comes to pitching agents and editors,  sometimes it isn’t about how good your book is. Sometimes it’s about  taste. What that particular agent or editor enjoys reading. So make sure  you’re taking your time when doing your research, and don’t take it  personally when something just doesn’t gel.In my opinion though, a great set of first pages, a great first chapter, is one thing and one thing only.A first chapter is a promise between a book and the reader.Are you getting ready to read a fantasy novel and explore a lush,  imagined world? Is this a contemporary YA, packed full of swoons? Are we  going to be scared? Thrilled? Challenged? Those first pages tell your  reader what they are in for, and promises them that they can look  forward to more in the chapters ahead.Don’t break your promise.And no, an unreliable narrator isn’t an example of breaking a  promise, friends. You can usually tell when a narrator is messing with  you early on. And even if you can’t, you’re promising more than just a  tricky storyteller. There’s the world. The people around your character.  The tone. The voice. The stakes.You should be able to establish that in the first chapter. And then, you should be able to keep your promise.Let’s have a look at a few fantastic examples of diverse YA reads with kick ass opening pages.Read the full post at DailyDahlia.wordpress.com" True link

The audience was divided about the actions of the main  character to the point where an argument broke out.

In March.Question: I really loved Unf*ck Your Habitat: You’re Better Than Your Mess. My sister and I have followed the blog for a long time … What was your journey to starting it in the first place?Rachel Well, I’m definitely what I generally refer  to as a reformed messy person. I feel like a lot of these books and  systems and everything are done by people who are very naturally neat  and very naturally tidy and clean. So it started out as me yelling at  people to get up and do what they have to do, and it sort of morphed  from there, turned into something a little bit different. It’s a lot  less mean than it used to be.Question: One thing that my sister and I were talking about  the other night — we’re both very messy people, and not reformed,  unfortunately, we’re in the process of reforming … Rachel And reforming is a long journey, trust me.Question: Right. But we talked about a couple of other approaches, like the Fly Lady,  for example, feel very traditional — even the name kind of implies that  it’s a lady’s job to be doing this. And so another thing I really liked  about your book was that you have these sections about some of the  social constructs around cleaning in general.  Rachel: The very first thing I like to do is take  that assumption of, okay, it’s a woman’s job, and throw that out the  window, because everybody who lives in a space should be responsible for  that space. And I think it does everybody a disservice if we’re saying okay,  you’re a man, so you don’t have to worry about this. It’s bullshit. And  then as far as the other kinds of people who have felt left behind by  these systems before — you know, people who do have disabilities or  invisible illnesses or mental illness — those things are a very real  part of somebody’s life and they affect how they’re able to interact  with cleaning, and how they’re able to interact with their home.

Here, Rachel Hoffman—who authored the just-released book Unfuck Your Habitat: You’re Better Than Your Mess—shares her no nonsense, uncomplicated tips for decluttering your life…the sane way.With  the amount of time that so many of us spend online, on our phones, or  otherwise interacting with technology, it’s important to remember that  our digital habitat is often in need of cleaning up just as much as our  physical one. Sure, you’re unlikely to trip over digital clutter like  you would a pile of clothes, but organization and upkeep are still  critical to keeping our digital lives clean, streamlined, and easy to  engage with.Spring clean your digital habitat with these easy-to-incorporate habits.SmartphoneFirst  and foremost, when you unlock your screen, what kind of state is your  home screen in? Are your apps sorted into logical folders or groups? Do  you have your most frequently used apps in places that are easy to get  to? How many of those apps have you not used in, say, the past six  months? Your first objective should be to streamline and organize your  home screen so it’s intuitive and not too cluttered. Delete apps if you  don’t use them. Then give your contacts, voicemails, and text messages  the same treatment. Delete things you no longer need or use (or  anticipate needing for reference). To help keep things neat and  easy-to-use, make sure that as you download new apps or add new contacts  that you’re taking an extra moment to place them where it makes sense  or to make sure you have a complete contact record right from the  beginning.Continue reading at Elle.com" True link

We can help with that, thanks to  our 2017 Coach of the Month series. Here, Rachel Hoffman—who authored the just-released book Unfuck Your Habitat: You’re Better Than Your Mess—shares her no nonsense, uncomplicated tips for decluttering your life…the sane way.If  you’re feeling overwhelmed by your messy home, and nothing you do seems  to be making a difference, it just might be time to re-think how you  look at cleaning. Most people, when faced with a messy disaster of a  home, usually do one of two things:1.  Wait until it gets to the point of being completely unbearable and then  clean everything in a whirlwind marathon and then consider it done; or2.  Decide it’s all too overwhelming and just give up entirely, only  cleaning things that are needed for immediate use and ignoring  everything else because where do you even begin when everything is so  terrible?Unfortunately,  neither one of those approaches is particularly effective or  sustainable. With marathon cleaning, your home ends up completely clean  for a very short period of time, and then the mess accumulates until you  reach your breaking point again. With avoidance, you never make any  progress, and you continue to be frustrated and overwhelmed by your home  all the time. But there is a better way. Rather than knocking yourself  out doing it all at once or pretending the mess isn’t there at all,  investing just a little bit of time every day (or, realistically, most  days) will get you to a clean home that you can actually enjoy much  faster than you’d think.Continue reading at Elle.com" True link

You’ve worn so many hats in the publishing  industry—author, agent, and marketing—can you tell us a bit about how to  you got started? Your journey, as it were. So I had a pretty unconventional entrance into the world of  publishing, but I feel like my way in is starting to happen a lot more  these days. Which is great. Please, publishing. Please. Find talent in  different ways other than through resumes on your corporate websites.Anyhow. Back in Philadelphia I launched a popular local blog that ran  events, reviewed things, did interviews, and the like. And it caught  the notice of a local publisher, Quirk Books. I’d done some giveaways  for their titles at our events and on the site, and they were looking  for a social media/blogging person for the publishing house. They wanted  to see if I could do what I did for my blog, for them. I’d also been  working as a blog editor full-time for another company, so the interests  certainly melded.Fast forward five years, and I’d had an awesome experience working on titles like Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children, Pride & Prejudice & Zombies, William Shakespeare’s Star Wars,  and so many more. I produced book trailers, social media campaigns,  worked on blogger marketing, all kinds of fun stuff. And I loved it all.But, I did want to work on some of my own passion projects, so after  those glorious five years with some really brilliant people, I went to  work with P.S. Literary. Quirk was putting out a title by one of the  authors represented there, and I really loved a lot of the work my  now-colleagues had done (and continue to do). And now, that’s where I  am, working on lots of YA, genre-fiction, and select non-fiction  projects.Author-wise, that’s another unconventional route. My colleague and  publisher at Quirk, Jason Rekulak, came to me with the idea for The Geek’s Guide to Dating. Like, literally came downstairs to talk about it. I was thrilled, and I wrote it while working on my YA projects. Inked (and soon Branded) came a bit later, but my author career definitely took off thanks to the team at Quirk.Continue reading the interview at PublishingCrawl.com" True link

Science Fiction Vs Science Fact: How Far Do You Go in the Science and When Do You Focus on Storytelling? by Tee Morris 	 	Science fiction is hard. Really hard. That may sound like an understatement, but when writing in the genre, you need to decide how far you want to go in showing your research into the pros and cons of generation ships, how gravity wells work, and the physics behind a lightsaber. In this discussion hosted by award-winning science fiction author Tee Morris, we discuss the fine line between knowledge and education against character development and storytelling. 	 Strangers in Strange Lands 	by 	Max Gladstone	 	World-building and character are different sides of the same  coin—especially in science fiction and fantasy. No matter how intricate a  world you create, your protagonist will reshape it with her will and  action; no matter how vivid a character you draw, they’ll be shaped and  limited by their context. Pitch Your Science Fiction or Fantasy Novel to a Literary Agent 	Join us for the live event and have a chance to get written feedback on  your query letter from a literary agent who works with science fiction  and fantasy authors.  Participating agents include Kurestin Armada (P.S.

I don’t? Hahah. I try my best, but it does get hard sometimes. When  it comes to managing my own writing with the work of my clients as an  agent, I always put their work first. I have a really hard time even  thinking about my own projects when I know I have their writing sitting  on my computer or my tablet or waiting to be sent out someplace.  Oddly enough, it makes me work harder. If I really want to work on  some new personal project, I absolutely have to be finished working on  everyone’s various projects and needs. Keeps me accountable. How would you describe your job to non-publishing professionals?  I pretty much have to do this every day when explaining my job to  my parents, so, I’m used to this. Literary agents work to discover  authors and get them published. We spend a lot of time polishing up  manuscripts with our clients, researching the right editors for those  books, and negotiating the best deals when they are presented.  But, it goes a little further than that. We help manage careers,  dish out advice, and guide through the publishing process. We watch over  contracts and terms, make sure the author is getting what they are  promised. We handle rights for things, selling books to foreign markets  and the like.  There’s a lot that goes into it, making it way more than just “selling books for people.”  I like to focus on the marketing end of things, as that’s what I  did at my previous publishing job. I work with my authors on their  online presence, when they want help with it. We talk about marketing  tactics they can tackles for their respective books.Using only one word, describe yourself to your followers.  Eclectic.Continue reading at ANewLookOnBooks.com" True link

About their books, about their platforms, all kinds  of good stuff, sharing advice as well as dishing out suggestions for  their projects.But without fail, at every conference I attend, there are certain  questions I ask that seem to trip writers up. And sometimes, not having  answers to those questions sends up serious red flags.So I thought I’d do a little post, to dish out some tips for those of  you pitching agents and editors in-person. Because while you may have  polished that pitch to perfection, you’re going to need to answer these  kind of questions.1. What’s Your Book About?: Right away, at every  conference I go to, when I sit down with an author, this is what I open  up with. Tell me about your book. What have you written? What’s it  about? Give me the details.This should be the quickest and easiest question to answer, but sometimes it trips people up.Every writer comes prepared to talk about their book at these things.  It’s why you are there, for the most part. But not every writer is able  to talk about their book in a quick, succinct way. Remember, you’ve  only got like ten, maybe fifteen minutes here to sum up your entire  story.Don’t use this time to explain the entire intricate plot of the book.  This isn’t a book report. Treat it as though you’re reading the  back-jacket copy of a book to a friend in your local bookstore. You’re  shopping and you’re trying to sell them on this book. That’s what you  would show them.You can read the jacket copy of a book in a minute or two. You want  to have plenty of time for the agent to ask YOU questions and for you to  ask your own. Don’t spend it explaining every little thing. Save room.2. How Many Words?: Know the word count of your book. Agents and editors are going to ask this.And that being said, before you even get ready to pitch, know what  the typical word count is for your respective genre. If you show up  boasting an enormous, unheard of word count for a book, it might tell  the agent / editor that you’re not familiar with the genre.Writer’s Digest has a great post about typical book lengths here. There are exceptions to every rule, of course. Just be savvy.Continue reading at EricSmithRocks.com" True link

Here, Rachel Hoffman—who authored the just-released book Unf*ck Your Habitat: You’re Better Than Your Mess—shares her no-nonsense but actually realistic approach to cleaning up your clutter. Of  all the habits you can incorporate into your daily routine to make  cleaning up around the house easier, “Don’t put it down, put it away”  seems like the most obvious. Because, yeah, if you put things away, your  home stays cleaner. Couldn’t get more straightforward than that, right?  Well, obviously it’s not that simple, or we’d all have immaculate homes  already.So,  how do you retrain yourself to put things back in their proper homes  the first time? First, it’s worth taking a look at what you’re already  doing. When you come home from the store, do you put everything in the  bags away right away, or do you still have purchases in bags sitting on  the counter a day or a week later? When you kick off those shoes after a  long day, do they end up back in the closet, or do they just stay where  they landed? After using the scissors or can opener or nail file, do  you just set them down on whatever surface is closest to you, or do you  take the time to put them back where they belong? We end up putting  things down and not away over and over throughout the day, and all of  those little things can add up to one big mess.Continue reading at Elle.comTeam UFYH’s Rachel Hoffmann is Coach of the Month over at Elle  Magazine!!

But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique  Grant for the job, no one in the journalism community is more astounded  than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?Monique is not exactly on  top of the world. Her husband, David, has left her, and her career has  stagnated. Regardless of why Evelyn has chosen her to write her  biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart  her career.Summoned to Evelyn’s Upper East Side apartment,  Monique listens as Evelyn unfurls her story: from making her way to Los  Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the late  80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way. As Evelyn’s life  unfolds through the decades—revealing a ruthless ambition, an unexpected  friendship, and a great forbidden love—Monique begins to feel a very a  real connection to the actress. But as Evelyn’s story catches up with  the present, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s  own in tragic and irreversible ways.Filled with emotional  insight and written with Reid’s signature talent, this is a fascinating  journey through the splendor of Old Hollywood into the harsh realities  of the present day as two women struggle with what it means—and what it  takes—to face the truth.

I’m closing for queries in August for  the rest of 2017, with the exception of referrals and conference  or contest requests.Why?Well, my darling wife and I are expecting a little one in September.  So it’s going to be a busy last half of 2017 for the Smith household.  And with my adoption anthology coming out in the beginning of September,  and a mini book tour in October,  all while the baby is around… well, I’m going to need to take a  breather, and dedicate my time to my family and current roster of  clients, who are also much like my family. *hearts*" True link

And that’s exactly what this surprisingly steamy, contemporary-fantasy  novel is. A mashup of genre in a book that’s hard to classify, but with  story that’s gripping and characters that are just so very lovable. It  reminded me of reading Morte by Robert Repino, a book that challenges you to define it, and is unquestionably amazing.And that’s the sort of book Rebecca has written.Read the full announcement at EricSmithRocks.com" True link

We were in Yakima at the beautiful  house where we were getting married in a month, nailing down the final  details. Our wedding planner, Michelle, was running the show like the  world’s nicest taskmaster.“Andrea,” my dad summoned me—he’s a big man, a British-born entrepreneur who played rugby in his youth.“Yeah, dad?”“Listen,” he said, “I have some ideas about how we should make our  arrival to the wedding.” Our arrival? My husband I were getting married  at his parents’ house: I would spend the day prepping and drinking  champagne with my bridesmaids in the house, while he had beers with his  groomsmen in the loft about the barn. My father continued, “I was  thinking we should come in a horse and carriage.”At first, I thought he was joking. We were getting married at a home,  I was thirty-four years old, and furthermore, I’m a feminist. I didn’t  have a single princess-y fantasy about my wedding, but the same couldn’t  be said, apparently, for my father.Continue reading at APracticalWedding.com" True link

Of course, there are always sisters  who fall somewhere in between. But wherever you and your sister end up  on the scale of the sister bond, the reasons are often complex and  multi-layered.After all, the sister relationship is one of the longest in your  lifetime. Statistically speaking, women outlive men by five to ten  years, and children outlive parents. So it’s likely your sister will be  the one person who will be with you the longest. She’s also likely to be  the one person who will know you best.

Check out some of the reviews: “Unfuck Your Habitat is the perfect housekeeping guide for somebody who is overwhelmed with their mess and can’t figure out how to start—or somebody who is always starting marathon cleaning projects only to watch everything go to hell again.” –Lifehacker “Hoffman’s approach to tidying up is blunt, utilitarian, and […] the epitome of of a moderation diet: Do what you can, when you can, and stop beating yourself up about it.” –Elle  “If squalor has become the default state of your living space, author Rachel Hoffman is going to help you snap out of it.” –Crave Online “[An] accessible guide on how to clean for normal people — people too broke to hire a maid, college students, perfectionists and more.” -Livestrong “This is the only system that has ever worked for me because it feels doable and practical, and like she is appealing to me right where I am. It actually changed my life and my home; I’m serious.” –Book Riot “Who else has scoffed at cleaning books and thought, ‘Yeah, OK’? They just seem unrealistic, and nobody has time for that, anyway. But before you accept that your home will forever be a pigsty, there’s a book out there that speaks to people like you and me. Rachel Hoffman’s Unf*ck Your Habitat: You’re Better Than Your Mess is the cleaning guide that you’ve always needed. It sets totally doable goals while keeping in mind that you have a life.” –POPSUGAR “Unfuck Your Habitat is a practical guide on forming habits by taking small steps, incrementally addressing messiness and personal weaknesses.

Some publishing companies have imprints devoted to multicultural books  (HarperCollins’ Amistad, Simon & Schuster’s Salaam Reads, Kensington’s Dafina), and others make diversity their primary mission (Lee & Low).  Nearly every established publisher, from the Big Five to independent  presses, has launched some sort of initiative or committee or program  dedicated to diversity. But are these efforts enough? How do  agents—generally considered the gatekeepers to publishing  companies—approach this highly subjective issue? Are they in a position  to increase diversity and equity in publishing? I asked Saba Sulaiman of  Talcott Notch Literary Services and Eric Smith of P.S. Literary. SANGEETA MEHTA: To start, what is your definition of diversity? Do you think that this word is losing its meaning, or is the conversation just getting started?SABA SULAIMAN: I think the conversation has already  started—in fact, author Alisha Rai did a fantastic panel at the RT  convention this year called Diversity 102 which addresses this issue  perfectly (here’s the thread).  Most industry professionals are aware of the need for more diverse  books—I’m ready to talk about how best to combat the lack of diversity  in publishing, both in terms of the books we read and push out, and in  terms of employing more marginalized people in the industry.ERIC SMITH: For me, diversity is about a wide array of  people being represented. And the reason we frequently talk about  publishing having that diversity problem, is because…well, those people  aren’t represented. And it’s tiring. I don’t think we’re losing the  meaning, I think lots of us are just exhausted from having the same  conversations again and again.Read the full interview at JaneFriedman.com" True link

Read on for her responses, and be sure to check out the rest of  the blogs on the tour for more reviews of The Antique House Murders, and  even more interviews with Leslie.Do you have any particular writing rituals that you adhere to, or unique methods of overcoming writer’s block?I do a great deal of prewriting. For this reason, I’ve never faced an  honest-to-goodness BLOCK. I have this blank wall that I love covering  with sticky notes and index cards. I build my stories fact by fact,  filling in character traits, interesting words, scene ideas, and so on.  When I’m not sure where to take my characters next, and when they’re  also stubbornly silent on this question, I go to my wall and work my  outline for awhile. I constantly add to, change, throw away, and move  around my notes–anything to keep the story ideas flowing. Even 15  minutes of “wall work” is enough to get me unstuck and moving forward. What do you enjoy doing when you’re not writing?My husband says I’m restless, but I like to call it a desire to keep  busy. I garden, play tennis, walk, read—of course, and cook. I also  spend a lot of time talking to my daughter on the phone. What did we do  before cell phones?Read the full interview at BooksTheThing.com" True link

It’s been edited by a critique partner.  You’ve assembled a pitch. Now what? The next step is securing  literary representation to pitch your project to prospective  publishers. At P.S. Literary we receive approximately 2,000 emails a  month from aspiring authors—so how does a writer get from the slush pile  (what agents call those unsolicited emails) to our client roster?Believe it or not, it’s a series of reasonable steps that separate the rejections from the requests:1. Follow A Simple TemplateA  three-paragraph structure (1: title, word count, genre, hook; 2: an  overview of the plot told in a sales-oriented way like back cover copy;  3: a short author bio focusing on platform) is all you need. But don’t  label or number those paragraphs. Instead, try to make it flow like a  cover letter for a job. Most importantly, remember the goal of a query  letter is to get an agent to request more material, not to tell us your  life story or the entire backstory of your project. Leave us wanting  more, not with glazed eyes from an over-sharing monologue. If it’s too  long I’ve probably stopped reading 25% of the way through. Some agents  ask for the title, word count, and genre at the bottom of a query  letter, but in my opinion essential information should absolutely be at  the top in case the agent doesn’t make it to the end.Read the full article at OpenBook.ca " True link

What is your favorite word?   FINISHED!  Every author loves the feeling of completing a project, and  hearing your editor say that SHE also considers the manuscript to be  finished is a sensation second to none.2. What is your least favorite word?   I take issue with the word CAN’T.  Girls can’t join our club, I can’t  possibly complete this project on time, You can’t get anyone to publish  your book, We can’t fix what’s wrong.  Saying CAN’T closes every door.  Possibilities, hope, second chances, all of that is just shut down.3. What turns you on creatively, spiritually, or emotionally? Being  outdoors charges me up like nothing else. I love sleeping under the  stars, eating out of doors, walking in all kinds of weather. If I hit a  block in my writing, a stroll around the neighborhood never fails to  shake something loose. And no matter how stressed I’m feeling, I can  pull weeds for thirty minutes and turn my day around.Read the full interview at GirlWithBookLungs.com" True link
