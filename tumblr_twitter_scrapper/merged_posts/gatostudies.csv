Like my older brothers were friends w Jennifer Lawrence when they were like 12 and I just found out I’m friends w the cousin of the girl who voiced honey lemon in big hero six like, idk what I’m supposed to do with either of these tid bits I feel like I was supposed to live my life in ignorance of them the tags on this are so funny because they range from “my neighbor went to school with tom cruise” to “my dad is best friends with macklemore”  i made awkward prolonged eye contact with joe jonas on the street  i gave cara delevingne the complete works of richard siken after i accidentally wandered onto her film set one afternoon while on my way to buy a baskin robbins ice cream cake  my brother went to high school with Glenn Howerton, or Dennis from it’s always sunny. Glenn was a grade above my brother and they liked the same girl at the time so Glenn beat the shit out of my brother at a keg party to impress her. my brother still refuses to watch it’s always sunny over something that occurred in 1994  My Aunt Eileen’s brother is Bib Fortuna from Return of the Jedi  A friend of a friend’s uncle played Chewbacca.  A friend used to run with Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson/Twiggy Ramirez in the ‘90s. I think she was dating one of the dudes from NIN (not Reznor). I was thisclose to going drinking with Michelle Rodriguez c/o of a friend but my mom was in town. My mom and Jane Fonda are basically old friends due to their both being deep in the antiwar movement in the ‘60s and linked via Tom Hayden.  When I was a kid, I met the sons from Home Improvement and my dad was trying to get me to make that noise Tim Allen makes and I remember being too embarrassed. I was like 4 years old.  Then Oprah cut in line in front of me at Wildwood. My old hair stylist went to high school with Corey Taylor from Slipknot and he always told her when he was in town and gave her tickets to his shows.  I almost got to go to an afterparty with Dragonforce back when ZP was the lead singer, but since I was there with my underage friend we had to decline. ;;  I had dinner with Steve Vai because he’s friends with my Uncle.He is a nice man.  my ex’s sister was best friends with katy perry growing up and boy let me tell you did i learn a lot about katy perry and all the rational explanations for her behavior knowing that she was raised in calvary chapel  one time michael cera cut in front of my dad and i at the turnstile on the subway.  dad called him an asshole without realizing who he was mom went to high school with ron jeremy (yes, that one)  My cousin was on MTV and Justin Bieber tried to crash her birthday party but she kicked him out and called him a child.  i’m friends with a guy who used to regularly play basketball with his dad’s neighbor, john cena. he facetimed me while they were playing because he knows i’m wet for cena and rather than saying ‘hello, big fan’ like a normal person i, instead, cried immediately.  my grandma went to high school with oprah and she got a signed graduation picture from her " False text
