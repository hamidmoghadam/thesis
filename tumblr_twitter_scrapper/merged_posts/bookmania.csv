This aching, and shivering happiness  That burns my skin and bares never ending light, this crying that comes from joy– Is my song. Your tears will tickle out, as a form of an overflowing gratitude to your past, but there will be a torture inside your tummy: A torment of sweetness and fragrance; because it will embrace your nothingness, and nonetheless explore your darkness. If this one breaks, It will only make you laugh, because My pulse is your drinking glass, and my absence is your obsession. And if ever my heart gets inflamed, It will be burned with all of your smiles that I love– The wrinkles that they leave. This is how to surrender love, for truth; And lust, for hope. This is how to try, because  certainly you could get those tiny moments of sadness, but just in case that you need it, break it! So that you aren’t only safe, But you are secured, because what I give, Is true. (Archie Camps, Feb 15, 2017)" True text
