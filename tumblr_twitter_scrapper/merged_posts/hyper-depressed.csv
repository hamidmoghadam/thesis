Here’s a list on how to avoid cravings and how to avoid binging as well as burning some calories too. 🌻 Water. Learn to love it. It will solve your appetite issues like none else. If you feel the need to binge/eat, ask yourself: Have you had enough water today? I usually aim for 4 liters a day, but normally people should drink at least 2 liters a day. First, chug a glass of ice cold water and then sip on warmer/room temp water to keep you full. Your body will also burn calories warming the cold water, so that’s a plus. Feel free to garnish your water intake with lemon, lime, cucumber, and mint. All are great for you! 🌻 Identify your binge patterns. Try to find when you falter most. Remaining conscious about it the entire time duration is a big help in preventing snacking.  🌻 Count backwards from your current weight to your goal weight. For each number, list a reason you want to change yourself. By the time you finish, you’ll probably find your hunger has subsided. 🌻 Basically keep yourself occupied. (Listed below.) 🌻 Do a new exercise or yoga position. Work on perfecting that for at least 30 minutes. 🌻 Paint/do your nails. 🌻 Make a cup of tea, no sugar or dairy.(Peppermint/green tea help curb cravings.) Really savour the smell, the warmth. Take your time enjoying it.  🌻 Take a cold shower. Cold showers burn calories. 🌻 While you shower, shave, exfoliate, wash your face. The longer you’re in there, the more calories you burn. 🌻 Play with your pet. Take them on a walk.  🌻 Clean. Your room, the living room, bathroom, kitchen, anywhere. Really get in there and scrub. Cleaning burns calories.  🌻 Watch a new show on Netflix. For every episode, do 2x the episode number of sit ups and pushups to stay active. 🌻 Do an hour of silent meditation. I recommend earphones and a background soundtrack of Tibetan Singing Bowls. 🌻 Make art if that’s your thing.  🌻 Read 50 pages of a new book. Drink water/tea while doing so. 🌻 If it’s sunny where you are, sunbathe and listen to music or a podcast. I recommend Welcome to Night Vale. 🌻 Call your grandma. See how she has been. Give her your time. 🌻 Go for a drive. Bring a friend. 🌻 Still hungry? Chew on ice. It helps kill cravings by tricking your stomach. 🌻 Re-do your hair and makeup. 🌻 Take a nap. 🌻 Go online and watch lecture segments from the open courses Yale offers. 🌻 Plan your next 5 meals. 🌻 Plan your next fasting period. 🌻 Write/start a journal. 🌻 Look at thinspo, reblog it, save favorites, etc. 🌻 Make one of these lists. 🌻 Look at some nature scenery in your life (yard, horizon, favorite hiking spot) and take as long as you need to take the entire view in. Breathe in the air, capture the colors, remember the sounds. 🌻 Identify all of your problem areas. Record these. 🌻 Renew your goals. These are just some that I practice daily. Feel free to add!! And good luck!" False text
