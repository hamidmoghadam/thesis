In the film, Ori Inu: In Search of Self, we  follow the character‚Äôs internal conflict of dealing with two seemingly  different worlds in order to gain a better understanding of self. As a  child in Brazil, Natalia is greatly influenced by the religion  Candomble, one that is banned and forbidden to be practiced publicly.  After being forced to move to America, Natalia is conflicted on staying  true to her Brazilian roots versus assimilating to a Christian  culture. The film creates the perfect collision of  Afro-futurism and ancestral spirituality in this Afro-Diasporic film as  Natalia is visited often by Orisha, Yemaya, Goddess of the Sea while  also being pressured into Christianity by both her mother and boyfriend.Filmmaker, producer, director and co-writer Chelsea Odufu, along with  her brother co-writer Emann Odufu, aim to remove negative stigmas  placed on traditional African religions, and critique ideas of cultural  and religious supremacy and intolerance of anything different in our  society. In a director‚Äôs statement released at the film‚Äôs trailer  premiere in September, Chelsea states:‚ÄúAdditionally, this film reflects the immigrant  experience in America and combats the idea that it is necessary to shed  aspects of your own heritage in order to assimilate into a monolithic  idea of what it means to be an American.‚Äù Ori Inu: In Search of Self is an innovative and  revolutionary film inspired by the Black Arts Movement in the 1960‚Äôs.  The film includes Tony Award winning actress Tonya Pinkins as well as  other notable up-and-coming actors such as Trae Harris. The film will  feature performances by OSHUN as well as the Grammy-nominated group Les  Nubians. The film is backed largely by the Museum of Contemporary  African Diasporan Art in Brooklyn where the trailer release was also  held in September. The release date has yet to be determined."
