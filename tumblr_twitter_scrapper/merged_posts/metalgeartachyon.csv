But here it is.  I’m 19 years old & on Monday (May 15th) I’ll be 10 weeks pregnant. I don’t live in an environment that’s healthy for a baby, or a pregnant woman for that matter. I don’t have the emotional intelligence, mental health, or proper finances to raise a baby either. A medical abortion at my local clinic will cost me $1800, and my job’s heathcare plan conveniently does not cover abortions, meaning I will have to pay this all myself. I live with my deeply religious parents who would disown me if they were to find out I was pregnant out of wedlock, much less to find out I was planning to have an abortion.   I can’t depend on them for help with accessing an abortion or for any support regarding this situation. Right now I have a little over $1000 saved for my abortion. My appointment is in a little over a week, which I will then need to pay for my abortion. I’m in desperate need.

There is an infamous building on our campus, called “Montgomery House” or more commonly, “Monty.” Monty is the building for animation, game design, special effects, sound design, and basically everything that requires highly powerful, highly specialized computers and software. The building is infamous for a couple of reasons. It’s located pretty far away from any other building, for one.   The building itself used to be a coffin factory, no joke.  Another is the building has no windows. None. There are also no clocks anywhere. Once you enter Monty, you are completely separated from the flow of time and the light of day.  Probably the reason Monty is most known though is because students in the “monty majors” have to spend a lot of time there. A lot. It is not uncommon for somebody to spend more than a few days exclusively within the sunless, dark walls of Monty. If you go to the building, it is not surprising to see students sleeping on the floor, on the few chairs available, on the computers. Some bring sleeping bags and rations. Some just forgo sleep, buy espresso shots and work. The entire building just smells of coffee and sweat. It really seems like an exageration, but its not hyperbole.  Why I bring this up is because of something that’s started recenetly. Inside the building, the school has hung up artwork on the walls from other majors as is typical on campus. One of the artworks was a self-portrait painting of a man with long, scraggly brown hair and a full beard looking pensively off into the distance. The painting became known as “Monty Jesus.” Students, in their desperation for their files to render, or the computers to work, began to offer prayers to Monty Jesus. Soon, they began writing their prayers and taping them next to the painting. The wall is now covered, completly plastered, in prayers to Monty Jesus for things like “Fix the wifi” and “let me live through finals” and more simply “help me.” Candles have been added. Literal candles are placed around Monty Jesus in hopes he will help them. This is how religions are born. Monty Jesus is considered a “joke”, but people at Monty still hold…. quite a lot of superstitious faith in the concept. There is even talk of a “Monty Satan” that creates software failures. It might be in jest, but these students really are hoping for some force to help them. And they’ve given it a name, an image, and respect.  Monty Jesus is real, and I’m sure of it. The desperate students have created their own spirit and their own form of worship, out of need. Religion, spirituality, didn’t stop being relevant. It didn’t stop being something people need and want, and have the desire to create. It’s still happening, and it always will as long as their are people.  The spirit of creation, new deities and new worship, is alive and well today and should not be ignored simply because it is “new” or “a joke.”   Monty Jesus is Real and Strong and Our Friend  SCAD is such a weird and magical place.  As soon as I saw “Monty” I knew this was about my school  I go to this school and I can confirm he is real. Another weird happening that occurred in the dorm adjacent to Monty is the smashed fly incident. Basically, someone smashed a fly on the stairway wall in the dorm and, because no janitor in this building ever bothers to thoroughly clean the place, the fly stayed there for a good few weeks. Eventually, one of the students wrote “ART” next to the fly with a sharpie, and a few days after that, someone made a tiny frame and name tag to accompany the art piece Eventually some fool took this beautiful art piece down, and someone wrote a goddamn article about it in our school newspaper which prompted several students to erect a mini shrine on the stairwell in honor of the smashed fly. Art school is truly a magical place.  This is fantastic. " False text

I always thought this line (maybe unintentionally) covered almost every single question I had during the series.  Because Astral implies that Yuma is/has a piece of himself it explains why Yuma of all people was sort of chosen to be his host (though it seemed by chance before), why they can zexal, why Yuma can Shining Draw, etc. And if Astral and Don Thousand clashed in that battle while scattering all of their pieces, it seems reasonable that some of their “pieces” got mixed together, and/or became foils of the other.  Don Thousand’s hair droops down and long and his eyes are dull and half-lidded, while Yuma’s hair points up and his eyes are round and shining - basically their resigns reflect “hopeless” and “hopeful.”   And then there’s the matter of the fact that Don Thousand apparently has the emperor’s key symbol on his outfit somewhere, and how the Numbers were both pieces of Don Thousand as well as Astral’s memories.   So I’m saying that Don Thousand and Astral got pieces of the other, and that shows through in Don and Yuma’s designs. I think it goes with the theme of joining things that don’t seem to go together but actually have similarities, and how differences can become strength instead of a burden (ie: chaos summon).
