Him receiving that medal? If you asked the Founders, they’d probably say, “YES!”. But this is an honor that President Bush and President Obama both accepted from King Abdullah, and American Presidents have been exchanging gifts and honors with foreign leaders for most of our country’s history. It’s not what the Founders intended, but it’s not unconstitutional if the President does as Presidents usually do and accept the gifts or honors on behalf of the nation and entrust it to the National Archives. If Trump starts wearing the collar around all the time and calling himself one of King Abdul Aziz’s Arabian Knights because King Salman gave him a medal – and, with this President, he very well might fucking do that – then there would be some Constitutional issues."

There were some 30,000 nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal, the rough equivalent, on CIA director calculated, of 55 billion traditional 500-pound TNT bombs from World War II. Enough, as he said, to carpet each state in the union with a billion bombs – and still have five billion bombs left over.From start to finish, the entire process would take under an hour.Even as the nation lay in ruins at the end of that hour, the government would have already carefully considered how the United States itself – how the idea of the United States – would continue forward. During the Cold War, the government secretly invested billions of dollars in a complicated set of plans known as “Continuity of Government” (COG), “Continuity of Operations” (COOP), and its most secretive level, “Enduring Constitutional Government” (ECG). Through these programs, planners gave deep thought to what activities and processes would be needed following a nuclear attack – and even what totems of American culture should be saved. The World War II command bunkers in London eventually inspired a breathtakingly audacious and complex network of dozens of bunkers, ships at sea, scores of helicopters and planes overhead, even secret rail trains, and convoys of tractor-trailers in the United States.Prewritten presidential executive orders sat in office safes across Washington, as did secret draft legislation known as the Defense Resources Act, ready to be filled in Mad Libs-style with dates and emergencies, that laid out an entirely new structure and entirely new roles for how the government would function during a national emergency – effectively suspending the Constitution and Bill of Rights. The presidential Football is well known, but less well known is how the attorney general was accompanied through the darkest days of the Cold War by an “Emergency Briefcase” outlining FBI plans to sweep up thousands of Americans deemed a security threat. Long before Barack Obama made the Washington title “czar” popular, Dwight Eisenhower had imagined an expansive set of secret powers, preselecting nine men – mostly private citizens – who would be real czars, stepping in during an emergency to remake the private sector, seize assets coast to coast, and create new bureaucracies that would control nearly every aspect of American life until peace could be restored.The Post Office would be in charge of registering the nation’s dead; the National Park Service would run the refugee camps; the Department of Agriculture would distribute rationed food. Congress would retreat to a special bunker at a West Virginia resort; the Supreme Court would relocate to another resort in the North Carolina mountains; the Department of the Interior would move to the grounds of a former college in Harpers Ferry. The Federal Reserve kept an underground bunker stocked with a billion dollars cash inside Mount Pony, seventy miles south of Washington. FEMA would help the nation rebuild from regional bunkers in places like Denton, Texas, and Maynard, Massachusetts.It was also carefully decided that at the National Archives, the Declaration of Independence would be saved before the Constitution, and at the National Gallery of Art, Leonardo da Vinci’s Florentine masterpiece Ginevra de’ Benci took priority over Rogier van der Weyden’s Renaissance masterpiece Saint George and the Dragon. The Library of Congress knew it would save the Gettysburg Address ahead of George Washington’s military commission, and in Philadelphia, a specially trained team of park rangers stood ready to evacuate the Liberty Bell into the mountains of Appalachia.At every level, the COG system offered redundancy piled atop redundancy. It was a system that touched every state in the union – and nearly every state hosted a hidden COG facility. The scope of power involved was unlike anything our nation has ever experienced.– Raven Rock: The Story of the U.S. Government’s Secret Plan to Save Itself – While the Rest of Us DieBy Garrett M. GraffSimon & Schuster (BOOK | KINDLE)" True text

When Aaron Sorkin was researching  what would become The American President and The West Wing, Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos pulled out of his wallet what the Hollywood director first thought was a bus pass – it actually was the little card explaining how Stephanopoulos would be evacuated in the event of a nuclear attack. Sorkin incorporated that card into a later West Wing episode, where character Josh Lyman received such a card from the National Security Council and felt guilt because his co-workers wouldn’t also be saved. While shooting the scene, set consultant Dee Dee Myers, the former press secretary to Bill Clinton, pulled Sorkin aside to tell him that the scene was unrealistic because those cards didn’t actually exist. Sorkin was shocked: Even as a top aide, she’d never realized that her co-workers had exactly those cards – and she never did.”Garrett M.

NO AMERICAN PRESS WAS ALLOWED TO COVER THE MEETING. There was not even a pool reporter or a pool photographer from a United States media organization allowed to step into the Oval Office for five seconds to take a photo of Trump and the Russians. •But, hey, that’s okay because we can always count on TASS, the official Russian state news agency to cover our President’s meeting in the most important office of the “People’s House”:We ARE going to remember the names of the Republican members of Congress who aren’t raising questions, objections, or worries about what’s happening in this country, right?

Prince Philip acts like being a leading patron or active member of nearly 800 organizations is too much work for someone nearing their 100th birthday.Just kidding, I know the Duke of Edinburgh hasn’t been the most politically sensitive member of the British royal family, but I watched a documentary and read a few books about him and was really impressed by how involved he has been – and genuinely devoted to – scores of organizations that have created a lot of opportunities for a lot of people who were traditionally overlooked and underrepresented. He also seems to have more energy than most people who are 1/3rd of his age, including myself, so he’s been doing something right for the past seven decades. By the way, Prince Philip announced that he was lightening his workload when he turned 90 in 2011, but he took part in over 200 events last year, so I’m curious to see what his version of “retirement” might be.(Incidentally – and I’m not sure if this is relevant or not – but unnamed senior sources at Buckingham Palace who agreed to comment on condition of anonymity, told me that Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip have eaten newborn babies for breakfast every day since 1947 and that is the secret to what has made them immortal. The not insignificant levels of vampiric DNA that forms part of the royal couple’s genetic foundation probably plays a role, as well. In other words, they’ll live longer than you, me, cockroaches, and New York City’s Hell Gate Bridge.)" True link

So, I’ve finally made the jump and created a Patreon as many, many of my readers have suggested over the past couple of years. I’d like to get back to regularly writing the Original Essays and other projects about Presidential history that probably brought a lot of you to my blog. Honestly, if just half of my followers contributed $1 a month to my Patreon, I’d be able to focus on creating new content for you full-time while also self-publishing the print editions of my book that many readers have asked about. It sounds crazy, but it’s true.  So, if you are able to, please consider contributing to my Patreon. I’m coming up with some good ideas for those who do contribute, including: •Patrons who contribute at least $2 will get a free copy of my 2012 book, Tributes and Trash Talk: What Our Presidents Said About Each Other•Patrons who contribute at least $5 will get the 2012 edition of Tributes and Trash Talk AND the updated edition of the book – which I’m currently finishing (and, yes, it includes the 45th President) – BEFORE the book is officially released to the rest of the public.•Patrons will have access to exclusive content, including brand-new, full-length essays that will be available only to my Patreon contributors exclusively and won’t be published online through any other platform.•Patrons will also have an opportunity to contribute their ideas, suggest topics, and vote on new subjects for me to cover on @deadpresidents. Obviously, I’m not going to stop writing things here on @deadpresidents or stop answering questions if nobody contributes, but if readers are able to contribute just $1 a month to my Patreon I will be able to spend much more time doing those things and creating the content that probably gained your attention in the first place. It would also allow me to finish more in-depth projects like the Presidential Rankings or Vice Presidential Profiles, publish more of the always-popular Historically Accurate Transcriptions, and give me the opportunity to complete other ideas I’ve wanted to work on, including profiles of unsuccessful Presidential nominees and First Ladies. I’m grateful for your support and for motivating me to continue creating content about a subject that I have always loved. I wouldn’t have written about history for the past nine years on Tumblr (!) without if I didn’t have an audience that was willing to listen and that I enjoy sharing my work with. Even if it’s just $1 a month, your contribution to my Patreon will allow me to continue doing some really cool things on @deadpresidents and elsewhere – and contributors will have access to so much more. Thanks to all of you, and if you do want to contribute, you can go here or follow one of the hundreds of other links to Patreon in this post. Thanks again,Anthony  Thanks to everyone who has contributed to my Patreon so far! I’m extremely grateful for the response, as well as for those who reblogged my post. To all of the patrons who have already contributed and reached a level with rewards, I will be in touch soon to make sure I get those to you. If you haven’t contributed yet, I hope you’ll consider it. Even if just half of my Tumblr followers contributed only 50 cents a month to my Patreon, I could focus all of my time and energy into bringing you new content. I’m serious…just fifty cents a month from half of the people who read this would allow me to do that! Plus, once I get to a solid number of monthly contributors I won’t have to keep posting this request. (Believe me, I don’t like asking for contributions any more than you probably like being asked for contributions; it’s not something that I’m totally comfortable with and I’m sure it’s kind of obnoxious but…you know…capitalism and stuff.)  I hate to sound like the Jerry Lewis Telethon, but even contributing just 50 cents a month would give me the opportunity to self-publish the print edition of Tributes and Trash Talk: What Our Presidents Said About Each Other that so many readers have requested since it was originally released, create brand-new content every day, and follow through on bigger projects that I’ve wanted to complete and share with you. And, of course, there will be perks for contributors, including exclusive content that will only be available to my Patreon supporters. Thanks again to everyone, especially those who have already contributed. If others are ready to give your support – even if it’s just to shut me up or keep me from further plugging up your dashboard – you can become a Patreon contributor here. " False link
