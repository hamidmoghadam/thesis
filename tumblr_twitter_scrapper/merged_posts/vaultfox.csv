She isn’t a great speaker, she keeps to herself, she makes mistakes, she isn’t visually expressive, but these are all just character traits and there isn’t anything wrong with any of them. If she’d been a man they would have called him ‘sensitive’, but she’s a woman so she ‘doesn’t have a personality’. She borrows a line Cassian said that spoke to her and she ‘plagiarized’ him, but Captain America repeats every line anyone has ever said to him and ‘that’s how he say I Love You’. We get stuck in this pattern of “women are Adorkable or Strong Female Character Who Punches People and there’s no inbetween” and that’s not true but Jyn didn’t fit into those two categories so she was wrong in some way, and to some degree, all Star Wars heroines are. When Leia first appeared on screens she was ‘a bitch’ and ‘needed to be taken down a few notches’ When Padme showed up she was ‘girly’ and ‘overly emotional’ When Rey came out she was ‘too perfect’ and ‘a mary sue’ And Jyn is here and she’s ‘emotionless’ and ‘makes too many mistakes’. This feels less like women aren’t being represented accurately and more like maybe people just don’t want to see women doing anything at all on the screen. Bodhi was quiet too. Bodhi had a difficult time expressing himself. They say he’s sensitive. It’s weird how that works. " False text

Words: 883AO3 Link    Cassian squeezed the handles, pulling up then down violently to stabilize the data vault’s retrieval arms. Jyn jumped back at the noise, then stared up in wonder at the massive tower before them. Symmetrical rows of gray and red, black tapes breaking up the pattern. It was too sterile, too clean,         too       … perfect.    And yet it was the farthest thing from perfect at the same time.        Papa had been a part of this,       she realized        .       Had her mother not stood up to the Man in White, had Saw not left her when people had begun to find out who she was … perhaps         she       would have been a part of this too, a tool of the Empire.       No      , she shook her head, drawing her focus towards the tiny screen in front of her. This wasn’t the time for introspection. She lifted her gaze to find Cassian beside her, fiddling with the controls as Kaytoo’s instructions fizzled in through the comm.    “Once you have the project code name, I will locate it in the system. Then you can use the arms for retrieval.”    “Got it, Kay. Tell us how to locate the plans.”    “You must use the pad inside the vault to locate the plans. Once you do, relay the name to me.”    Jyn’s heart leapt into her throat as she turned back to the monitor, words in Basic words flitting by, blurred and non-specific. She tried to focus, to bring clarity to the generic words and phrases, but there were too many. Some with numbers and foreign characters, others with codenames and project aliases she wanted to forget ever witnessing. Were there         more       Death Stars hidden in plain sight? How many other war machines did the Empire have up its’ sleeve?    Cassian leaned closer towards her, as close he could while still covering the grips. He craned his neck, trying to understand the bright blue letters flashing by as much as she was.     It suddenly occurred to her – amidst the static-filled comm channel, the muffled commotion behind the vault door and Cassian’s breath hot at her ear – that she had no idea what she was looking for.       He’d already risked his life sending the message, gave       his life         for the message. But there had been no hint, no plan, no speck of knowledge to know what the Empire had made of his life’s work. What they’d named it, before unleashing it on the world.       She tried to hide her fear, swallowing hard before flicking through the names with a renewed sense of urgency, one that Cassian picked up on quickly.    “Jyn,” he started, letting go of the arms to stand at her side.    She continued to mutter names under her breath, pretending she hadn’t heard him.    “Pax Aurora, Mos Angora ….”    Cassian’s hand had come to rest on her shoulder, and as much as she tried to fight it, she was certain he could feel how much she was shaking. Still ignoring him, she continued to chant the names; foreign yet ordinary, hoping to make sense out of them.    “Ai Xonas, Pulse Solares ….”    “Jyn, slow down. Breathe, we’ll find it.”    She sighed, her thumb flicking slower as she felt his hand slip from her shoulder. She immediately missed the reassurance, the weight keeping her grounded. His presence beside her would have to be enough for now, he was right; they would find it.    “Thanks,” her voice was small, eyes flicking up to meet his before returning to the black and blue screen.     A few clicks, another row scanned, scattered syllables uttered under her breath before she was brought to a halt.        It couldn’t be, he wouldn’t —          Stardust.        His life’s work, the planet killer; he’d named it after her. She didn’t have the time to consider it a compliment or not, instead all she felt was the wave of relief crashing down around her at knowing which tape to pull.    “What? What is it?” Cassian searched her face, then down to the word highlighted on the screen.    “Stardust, that’s it.”    His eyes narrowed as he shifted his weight. “How do you know that?”    Jyn wasn’t sure if the admission would be enough to convince him, but she smiled all the same.    “I know because it’s me.”    She expected a laugh, an eye roll maybe, or nothing at all. But in return, she saw Cassian’s lips wind into a small, wry smile, mirroring her own. He hovered a moment longer, letting the realization sink in, before beckoning Kaytoo over the commlink to locate the plans for “Stardust”.    Kaytoo responded, and the tape deck flashed green. Jyn let herself smile,         another chance spent.       Though it hadn’t been a chance, not really. It had been something else, something she had never thought to question.    Jyn nodded, and Cassian raised the arms —reaching out for what they’d came for.    She watched the flashing green light like a beacon of hope, could hear Cassian mutter under his breath as he steadied the levers. She couldn’t believe it was happening — the Death Star plans, the ones the Alliance didn’t believe existed, wouldn’t take a chance on — soon to be in their grasp. She couldn’t bear to look away for even a second, but had she, she would have noticed that Cassian had never stopped smiling at her, had never stopped believing her. " True text

It’s been five or six months since Rogue One came out in theaters, and people are still so heavily pressed about Jyn Erso’s entire prescence in the film. I can hardly go through a week, maybe even less than two days without seeing somebody’s post about Jyn being a “white feminist”, that fans of Jyn/rebelcaptain shippers are apparently “racist demons”, and that Jyn Erso herself as character is horrible person that deserves no love and doesn’t belong with the Rogue One Family. Six goddamn months, and people still can’t keep the name Jyn Erso out of their mouths or typed on their screens for more than a week at a time. If you hate her so much, I’ve a series a methods to try to get you to cope with such feelings. 1. Don’t look at Jyn Erso content/rebelcaptain content. Honestly, its really that simple. 2. If you see said content anywhere on your dash/tags, here’s another fresh tip: Look away! Not that hard! 3. Focus on shit that you actually enjoy instead of writhing around in your negative emotions about a fictional character six months after the fucking movie came out. Once again, I say, not. that. difficult.  Now, with the “white feminism” argument that people constantly push, let me just say one thing. This is Star Wars, a fictional universe where not every concept that exists in ours is present there. I’m not denying that its existence, its definitely real, but this is Star Wars. The only people that have any form of privilege or power over another are the Imperials. Jyn Erso does not have any privilege. She’s in just about the same position that anyone else is in, running from the Imperials. She was born in a prison camp, for Christ’s sake, and she was on her way to prison again right when the movie began. If you read the novelization, or did any reading at all, you’d know that Jyn was actually contemplating whether or not she should just let her cellmate kill her right then and there. Nothing about Jyn shouts privilege in any way whatsoever, you just happen to be watching the movie with a lens that does not apply to Star Wars. Yes, Cassian was in the Rebellion, fighting since she was six years old, but Jyn’s childhood was not exactly luxurious either. She watched her mother get murdered and had to live a life on the run ever since. You can say her life was somewhat easier than Cassian’s, because maybe it was, but she has no privilege either.  And onto this “rebelcaptain is racist”  and “Jyn fans are racist” nonsense. Honestly, piss off with this. I’m a latino male, and let me tell you something, I know racism when I see it. I’ve been teased for my name, my skin color, and for just my background as a whole. I’ve dealt with racism, I’ve been bullied before for my ethnicity, and when you try to project a real issue that’s been going on forever now, something that I’ve personally been a victim of, it absolutely baffles me. You can’t seriously believe that rebelcaptain shippers/Jyn fans are racist, can you? With all of the bullshit going on right now, all other movies/films which are inherently racist for the fuck of it (I’m looking at you, Amy Schumer, Your new movie is as racist as you are.) you take your time to plaster nonexistent racism on people’s ships and their favorite characters? Fuck off. Why don’t you let people ship what they want to, like the characters that they want to, and try indulging yourself in something you enjoy for a change. Try not to pull a muscle from reaching so hard.  With Jyn as a character, a lot of you anti-Jyn people happen to be really disgusting and gross about her, and to Felicity as well. First off, fuck you again, Felicity did a wonderful job and is an amazing actress (Golden Globe nominee, mind you) and many people piss themselves about how she apparently can’t act, or showed no emotion. What the fuck do you expect of her? She’s not playing a happy, cheerful character, she’s playing a person with abandonment issues and lost pretty much her entire family. She’s not gonna smile her way through the movie, just so you know. Going back to Jyn herself, maybe you didn’t watch the whole movie or something? Jyn wasn’t perfect, but she wasn’t the devil either, she actually was just barely coping with loss if you hadn’t noticed. A lot of anti-Jyn’s who claim to “love” Cassian so much fail to realize that Cassian isn’t a saint, either. Don’t get me wrong, I loved Cassian, but he shot his contact in cold blood at the beginning of the film, and he’s done far worse things for the Rebellion, he’s not an angel himself. Some of you also fail to realize how vital their storylines are to each other, so those who headcanon Cassian and the Rogue One team abandoning Jyn, bullying her, or the termites who have some twisted fantasy where Cassian physically assaults Jyn or hurts in any way, you don’t understand character development and Cassian would deserve fans than you gross, vile people. I love Jyn Erso btw, so you can go ahead and block me because I sure as hell will continue to ship rebelcaptain and there isn’t a thing you can do to stop me.   Signed, approoved.  How on Earth are Rebelcaptain fans racist? That is insane. I’ve seen comments on Twitter about “white privilege” and I’m baffled." False text
