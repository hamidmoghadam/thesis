What are you currently trying to improve on? What is the most difficult thing for you to draw? What is the easiest thing for you to draw? Do you like to challenge yourself? Are you confident that you’re improving steadily? Do you draw more fanart, or more original art? Do you feel jealous when you see other people’s art, or inspired? (Be honest!) Do you like to draw in silence, or with music? For digital artists: what program(s) do you use? For digital artists: how many layers does a typical piece require? For traditional artists: what medium do you like most? (Pencil, charcoals, etc) For traditional artists: How do you usually start on a big piece?
