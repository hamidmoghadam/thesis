[Link is the invite link!]  ►  Mega Man Roleplay: There are channels for planning, “looking for”, and one for every series (Classic, X, Zero, ZX, Legends, BN and SF) for actual roleplay, besides a crossover one.   ► Is it only about roleplay?: Absolutely not! We welcome contributors of all kinds; people who might not roleplay but still can contribute with ideas, scenarios, prompts, help with lore, headcanons, encourage others, keep the community going, and discuss their love for Mega Man! We have a channel entirely dedicated to sharing art and fanfiction, so if you don’t write much but still draw, no problem! Your work can give us inspiration, and you probably have just as many nice ideas! (Some of us draw too, you know!)  ►  What else? There is one admin, three mods (including admin), over 22 members now (and counting!), Tatsumaki is one of the bots, and there is a custom bot in the works– this custom bot will offer tools such as RP profiles, randomized RP prompts at command, and much more! You’re welcome to suggest new features to add to it! In short: if you are a Mega Man lover, we would be happy to have you!  ►  What if I have questions before I decide to join/am very shy, so I need some help getting in? Just spam this Tumblr with messages or asks, I really don’t mind, haha. The more friendly people, the better! And I understand shyness and anxiety perfectly, as I am like that, too, though years of joining and modding RP groups has given me some experience on the socializing field. As long as you are willing, we can go as slowly as you’d like! " False text

This is the artist formerly known as Soul Rokkuman. As you know, whenever I have the chance to prepare something nice for a Rockman Anniversary, I love the opportunity to work alongside fellow fans. This time, I’m making an open call for people to participate in a new project from The Hyacintho Team. What is this about? As I mentioned in some earlier posts, I’m collaborating with Braulio Morales to bring you more fan music, covering some of the most beloved tunes that best represent Classic Megaman and Megaman X, merged in a beautiful music medley. With the date fast approaching, we would like to invite fans all around the world to, once again, show their love for the Blue Bomber on his Anniversary, through your fan art and fan love. How to participate Deviantart Users:  When your art is finished and ready for submission, submit your art to your Sta.sh, send me your link and name (or preferred online alias) to my current DeviantArt account MangoTeaCat (Please remember, I don’t use the account  “Soul Rokkuman” anymore on DA ^^ ;; ).  Tumblr Users: Submit via email at soul.rokkuman@gmail.com with the subject “ Rockman 29th Anniversary gallery”. Size specifications:  2150x3035 pixels, 300 dpi (horizontal or vertical).  Even though the subject of this album will be focused on the Classic and X Series, you are welcome to draw art from any Megaman series you love. However, for this project, we will only be accepting artwork of the main Rockman characters/protagonists. For example, Rockman.EXE and Hikari Netto are OK, but Elpiso is not. Please do not publicly post your art submission to any of your galleries or accounts until after the project is over and has been revealed. Thank you for understanding!   The deadline is on Saturday, December 10th,  [23:59] (Chile Summer Time (CLST) -0300 UTC ). If you need more time, feel free to ask (´ω｀). We are eager to create this new gallery alongside all of you, the the fans. Personally, I would like to add fans from the other side of the world and would like to request art in other languages, besides Spanish and English. I would greatly appreciate your help with this! 人´∀｀o) (o ´ ∀`人. I hope for the best with this project. If you have any ideas, suggestions, or concerns, feel free to send me a message. You can also visit us at the Hyacintho Team Facebook Page Carpe Diem! (●´ω｀●) " False text

Technically this is my 10th anniversary from the very first contest held at Rockman.EXE Online, but with one skipped year, it’s just the 9th round of drawing pictures of Rokkuman and Haapu Notu lovey-dovey rabble rabble, buku….  So perhaps next year will be a bigger blowout for the 10th  official contest, but for now, the format’s sticking to normal. But  that’s not to say this year won’t be fun with some special giveaways.  Thanks to some prodding, the (at one point) 4-way tie in my annual  category poll was broken this morning. And there was a clear winner of  the theme chosen by you. So without any further ado, here are this  year’s rules and regulations: RULES:    Two categories, which you are allowed to enter in each if you would  like. If you place in one category, you will be automatically  disqualified from the other, for reasons of fairness, and to give other  people a chance to win a prize.  CATEGORY 1: Scent of a MegaMan (Talent) Content Requirements:    * Create an advertisement for a Mega Man-themed perfume or cologne, with a character/characters of your choice selling it   * Get creative, including a brand name, tagline, price, bottle design, etc. Appeal to our sensual senses! So…this is a thing. A  real thing that I stumbled upon at Amazon. While not officially  licensed from Capcom, there is a legit Megaman fragrance for men,  totally blue because we all know Blue Bombers like to smell their best  wearing something blue. And I guess if we can have Megaman air  fresheners, more fragrances would be the logical next step. Ooo la la,  only in Paris… So your goal for  this category is to create your own fragrance and an advertisement for  it. If you want to stick with this particular “Megaman” brand and spin  something off of it, that’s fine. If you want to work with a different  character – say Cinnamon in a saucy spread promoting the perfume  “Archangel,” which is bottled up like the weapon of hers of the same  name, that’s totally within the creative boundaries, too. How creative  you get with this in terms of characters, brands, etc. is up to you. The  more you do, the better your chance of winning. Sell us a fragrance for  robots, Net Ops, alien beings, or power-crazy mad scientists that makes  us fall in love.  This theme will work as the talent category, so the judging will focus on the effort and skill you put into your advertisement. CATEGORY 2: St. Wily’s Academy Prom Night (Humor) Content Requirements:   * Prom Setting: Awkward  teenagers, embarrassing parents, fuddy duddy chaperones, hot dance  tunes, prom royalty, along with stylish and awful formalwear.   A  little-known-to-fairly-known fact from Hitoshi Ariga’s manga work is  that he had a concept pitch for a school-themed Rockman comic that he  called St. Wily’s Academy. Unfortunately, it never took off. This  changes now.  For the humor  category, you will be tasked with imagining one of the most important  nights in St. Wily’s Academy’s history: It’s first Prom Night. Most all  the Robot Masters and Navis and time-traveling humans from the Rockman  Universe are now awkward teens attending this school. Sure, you can  include some jocks and hot cheerleaders. But they were all awkward at  some point too.  Your goal in this  category is to make us laugh, but have fun with the settings and  details of this category, too. Perhaps there’s a special theme to this  prom, with funky decorations. Your setting could range from the prom  couple’s photo, to the coronation ceremony, to hitting the dance floor,  to those old doctor chaperones getting into some hijinks. Who spiked the  E-Tanks?! However you can best set up a funny prom scene is up to your  imagination! Again, any character  is game. How you want to pull it off as a crossover, or which Wily from  which timeline you want as the patron saint of this school is up to your  interpretation. It’s nonsensical, but you don’t have to stick to just  the Ariga-influenced Classic series setting and characters.  PRIZES: I had you guys vote for what you wanted most as prizes this time, so I will be sticking close to that.   Thanks  to the talented Mr. Gary Martin, I will soon have in my possession a  few inked pages from Archie’s Mega Man #43. One is page 9, which has an  awesome shot of Mega Man flinging Shadow Blades at Magnet Man. Which  makes me half-tempted to keep it, but I’ll put you guys first. The other  is page 17, in which Rush treats Needle Man like a tug-of-war chew toy.  One of these two 11 x 17 pieces will go to the winners of each  category. The winners will battle to the death over which one they  prefer, if they cannot peaceably choose between the two.  As always, I can also substitute a cash prize through Paypal for the winners if they would prefer:             1st : Archie’s Mega Man #43 inked 11 x 17 art piece PLUS a Rockman Nendoroid.                         2nd : Your choice of either a Rockman Nendoroid, a reasonably available artbook or large Great Eastern plush             3rd :  Rockman.EXE plush of your choice (If easily accessible by end of Feb., otherwise GE will have to do)             4th:  Small Great Eastern Megaman plush of your choice SUBMISSION GUIDELINES:  Only  submit your own work, as usual. Any character, major or minor, from any  series is allowed, to go along with the characters required in each  category. Pairing characters from different series is totally allowed.  Again, to be fair to all, same-gender groupings are allowed.   Participants  are allowed to submit from all over the world. It’s easier for me to  get prizes to US entrants, because international shipping is complicated  and pricey, but I’ll do what I can for you guys who aren’t in the  States. In some cases, Paypal might be the best option for your  winnings. Youngin’s, get your parents permission before entering. Entries do not need to be colored, but it is preferred. Entries can either be e-mailed to me at rock2125[at]hotmail[dot]com, or you can just PM/note me a link to your pic.   DO  NOT post your pics on your blog, in your fanart threads or dA  galleries until the contest is over. This is the fairest way for  competitive reasons. I prefer to keep them all secret until the deadline  has passed.  I’ll edit a  confirmed entry list in this thread when I receive them. So you won’t be  in the dark about whether or not I’ve received your entry. DEADLINE:  The deadline for this contest will be Friday, February 12th, 2015 by 11:59PM CST. MISCELLANEOUS INFO:   - As usual, If you don’t plan to enter, but would like to help me  judge, please let me know through PM or mention so.  Thanks to all my usual judges, and I’ll gladly let you help with it  again if you’re willing.  By all means, reblog to get the word out and help get people interested!    Bug me with questions if you have any. Please join in, and good luck to everyone who enters!  Confirmed Entries:  Category 1 - Fragrance Ad (Talent)  - digitallyfanged Category 2 - Prom (Humor) ????? " False text

That means I don’t really have a holiday to base a puzzle around today, so instead, I’ve turned to my own hobbies for inspiration. I’ve always been a fan of video games, and one of my favorite game series is called Mega Man. The original game is about a robot boy named Mega Man who fights against his robot brothers, who’ve been re-programmed to be evil by the fiendish Dr. Wily. The original Mega Man series has 11 entries to date, and each of those games features brand new baddies for Mega Man to fight, from Cut Man (a lumberjack robot with scissors on his head) to Pump Man (a sewer-dwelling robot who works like an old-timey water pump). You may notice that the name of our hero, Mega Man, as well as that of all of his enemies, end with the word “man.” That’s all I need to put together a quick puzzle. If you’re subscribed to the podcast, you probably already have this new episode, but if not, you can download it manually here. (With music by Landon Beall, Broke for Free, Nheap, Mark Sparling [”Day 2″ and “Day 8″], and  Takashi Tateishi [“Game Start”].) A text version of this puzzle appears after the break below.
