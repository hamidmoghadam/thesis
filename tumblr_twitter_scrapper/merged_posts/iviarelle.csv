Then they win by default, because they make up their own rules in which being upset automatically invalidates your argument. The key is also to argue about things that they have no stake and experience in, so they dont snap first. Of course in the event that they do snap first, its of course passion, not anger… White people are like little kids who make up new rules and obnoxious powers to keep themselves from losing…. At the end of it all, they are happy that you are so civil and can debate things rationally and clearly without getting upset. Everyone shakes hands and thanks everyone for being able to discuss “conflicting” viewpoints. Because after all everyone needs to hear the opposing side to truly be sophisticated. Even if you’ve heard that side all your life and it completely devalues you as a human being. What i hear is that the mark of civilization to white people is being dehumanized and taking it like a champ.  They also have little to no concept of power dynamics in these ‘sophisticated” discussions.  Why I stopped indulging people who followed this argumentative “format”  This is so real and applicable to every dinner party I’ve ever been to  This is a particularly aggressive form of Sealioning. Sealioning is the name given to a specific, pervasive form of aggressive and willfully intentional cluelessness, that masquerades as a sincere desire to understand.  A Sealion is someone who, when confronted with a fact that they don’t care to acknowledge, say, the persistence of systemic racism in America, will ask endlessly for “proof” and insist that it is the other person’s job to stop everything they are doing and address the issue to their satisfaction. The purpose of Sealioning is never to actually learn or become more informed. The purpose is to interrogate. Much like actual interrogators, Sealions bombard their target with question after question, digging and digging until the target either says something stupid or is so pissed off that they react in the extreme. The other major reason why people hate Sealioning is because responding to it is a complete waste of time. It’s an insidious trap. Responding to questions asked reasonably is, of course, a natural thing for people to do. I like to do it myself; educating others is generally pretty entertaining, especially if they are receptive to learning. Dismissing those questions can appear condescending or rude, especially if you actually are condescending or rude. Of course, these questions are not asked because the person asking them genuinely wants to know the answer. If they did, they would do their own digging based on your statements, and only ask for obscure or difficult-to-discover information. This is the “debate principle”. It is best explained thusly: When you go to a debate, you educate yourself on the topics at hand, and only request evidence when a claim is either quite outlandish or unflinchingly obscure. No, these questions are asked to make a responder waste their time. It works, too; I’ve responded to Sealions before, answering all their questions and claims for evidence, only to be greeted by even more willful ignorance. It’s a way to force people into responding to questions phrased neutrally but asked in bad faith. The name “Sealioning” comes from a most splendid webcomic, “Wondermark”, by David Malki.   It can be found here: http://knowyourmeme.com/photos/873260-sea-lioningSealions are just “asking nicely” but they are asking questions that have been asked and answered fully many times, and are unwilling to so much as open a new tab to look up the answer, nor will they recognize the validity of your sources, your experience or expertise no matter what you do. It is impossible to satisfy a Sealion.Make no mistake.  Sealioning is a specific form of harassment. You may not explain their inquiry has already been address. You may not cite a source. You may not refer to a previous answer. You definitely may not ever point them to a link. You must spend all your time and energy responding as much as you can to every little details of every innocent, polite little question they ask. Sealioning isn’t a sincere attempt at anything. It’s a calculated technique to grind an opponent down.  If any of my followers feel like you’re being sealioned, I can play elephant seal and help destroy them.  Not only is this a thing, it’s actually something various hard right groups are teaching their members to do. It’s essentially just never backing down no matter what, never admitting someone else is correct, and always try to force the argument onto the path you want to go down. So I’ve found the best way to combat it is: A) Call them out on their inability to admit they were wrong. This sounds pretty simple, but it’s very easy to get dragged into whatever they say next instead of just pointing out that you’ve proven their first point is bullshit yet they’re still yakking on. B) They try to box you into a corner? Box them back. If they won’t accept a link, laugh at them for failing to understand it/read it. Call them out for trying to veer the conversation in another direction without yielding the point. Specifically state that you see their cheap tactics and find them weak and a sign of a poor debater.  C) Never let them move onto the next question. Demand they answer yours instead. Why should they get to set the terms of the debate? Why is it always them who deserves explanations?  D) Suggest that they’re arguing in bad faith. That they don’t really want an answer. And if they say no way? Then point out that someone arguing in good faith would do all the things they refuse to. They’d read links and evidence. They’d agree on at least *something*. And failing that, they’d walk away. Good faith arguers will reach a certain point and then just say agree to disagree. But these guys? Won’t. They will not leave it alone no matter what. That’s the hallmark of a sealion trained to demoralise us.  And when they indirectly admit that, you call them out on it. Then you don’t leave it alone. Hound that fucking sealion until he honks for mercy.  Still important. " False text

A few weeks back, a study went viral about the relationship between marriage equality policy and queer teen suicide rates, and a lot of people reacted thusly: “queer mental health is better when we’re not discriminated against! BREAKING: SKY IS BLUE, WATER IS WET” This happens a lot. People see research about a thing ~Everyone Already Knows~ and they mock it. Now I want to make two things really clear: 1. Everyone does not already know. 2. This shit can lose these projects their funding. Did you know that media coverage is a crucial factor in funding allocation? When we submit our application for grant renewal, we have to provide a list of news articles about our research so they can decide whether the public cares enough about us to let us keep doing our work. And most research doesn’t get all that much coverage, so individual reactions can really matter. If the primary reaction to our publications is eyerolling, we legitimately might not be able to continue. I’ve seen some frustration from people who believe this research funding would be better put to use “actually helping” the affected populations instead of–I don’t know, pinning them under microscopes or whatever it is they think we do. But funding for policy initiatives is driven by research. I know you wish politicians would listen to individual voices telling them where the problems are, but that’s honestly not a smart way to direct limited resources. We need solid evidence. And a lot of the areas that need the most attention aren’t obvious–who knew bisexual people are at a much higher risk for physical and mental health disparities than gay and lesbian people? Who would have guessed that transgender folks are more likely than any other group (including straight people) to be military veterans, but overwhelmingly don’t claim their benefits? I’m sure some people noticed these patterns, but they definitely weren’t common knowledge within the queer communities I’ve grown up around, and those findings are leading to direct action as we speak. I get that it can be frustrating to feel like your identity is being reduced to facts and figures for the benefit of red tape. But trust me, the researchers aren’t your enemy here. Most of us are queer too. All of us are just as frustrated by this crap as you are. We are doing our best, and I swear to you this work really is making a difference. Please don’t sabotage it.  I’m reblogging this because it only has 9 notes, and it should really, REALLY have a lot more.  Also, given the current US administration’s plan to stop collecting data on LGBTQ identities as part of the census, we are in need of accurate, useful data now more than ever.   Plus the ability to cite peer-reviewed evidence of these sorts of things and quantify the extent of “obvious” effects can be pretty important to researchers who are working in adjacent fields that don’t produce the sorts of headline soundbites that get mocked on social media. And often headlines and summaries are misleading and reductive- a study about wage gaps across a variety of demographics might get headlined “Women Still Make Less Than Men, New Study Shows” when the bulk of the paper is about the intersection of race and gender identity, and I’ve seen people on Tumblr mocking a study about the flavor compounds in food across the Indian subcontinent, conducted by Indian scientists at an Indian university, as “LOL white people don’t know how to cook.”  And to add to this– it’s also important to be able to point to something and say, no, the problem is not that these people aren’t straight. Being able to point to actual science that says, “no, it’s not us, it’s you and how you treat us”– well, that’s a a good thing.  There are a lot of people out there who genuinely believe that being any  flavour of queer is intrinsically harmful to you. That unhappiness is a  natural result of being gay, that to be trans is to be mentally ill,  that bisexuals are confused and troubled. There are people who believe that you cannot be happy or well if you’re queer, and not all of those people are bad people. Some of them have what they perceive to be your best interests at heart, and they want you to be happy, to be well, to be physically, emotionally and mentally safe. And they still act in a way that causes harm, that damages lives, isolates kids and tells them that pain is what they should expect for being who they are. It’s important to be able to say, “these policies kill kids”, to say, “no, this wouldn’t have happened anyway”, to say, “yes, it does matter what you do.”  Science: Because bigots don’t tend to believe the people they’re bigoted against when we way something hurts us.

For years, parents have pointed to anecdotal benefits of cannabidiol (CBD), a compound in the marijuana plant that does not produce a high, saying it reduces seizures in treatment-resistant epilepsy. Now doctors have performed a randomized trial to show cause and effect, with the findings published in Wednesday’s issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. To conduct the study, the researchers focused on Dravet syndrome, a rare form of epilepsy that begins in infancy and is linked to a particular mutation that often resists combinations of up to 10 conventional seizure medications. They enrolled 120 patients who ranged in age from 2.5 to 18 years. Sixty-one patients were randomly assigned to cannabidiol, and the 59 others to placebo. Neither the researchers nor the families knew who received the medication to prevent bias. All continued to take their existing medications. “The message is that cannabidiol does work in reducing convulsing seizures in children with Dravet syndrome,” said lead author Dr. Orrin Devinksy, who is director of NYU’s Langone Comprehensive Epilepsy Center. For those in the cannabinoid group, the median number of convulsive seizures per month dropped from 12.4 per month before treatment, to 5.9 seizures, the researchers reported. The placebo group, in comparison, only saw their convulsive seizures fall from 14.9 per month, to 14.1.  Continue Reading. " False link

Continue Reading.  Universal healthcare (medicare) across Canada was born with federal assistance in the1960s. By 1966, each province had a universal healthcare plan, paid for with a 50% contribution of costs by the provincial government and 50% from the federal government. These contributions from the federal government are called “transfer payments.” These days, the federal transfer payments cover only about 20%of the costs, down from the initial 50% share.  Ending the federal transfer payments for healthcare will be the beginning of the end for universal healthcare (medicare) in Canada. Bernier is not the ony Conservative in favour of this. It is part of official Conservative party policy reduce funding to medicare even further and to promote a private system. Vote wisely.  " False link

The Rice battery stores lithium in a unique anode, a seamless hybrid of graphene and carbon nanotubes. The material first created at Rice in 2012 is essentially a three-dimensional carbon surface that provides abundant area for lithium to inhabit. The anode itself approaches the theoretical maximum for storage of lithium metal while resisting the formation of damaging dendrites or “mossy” deposits. Dendrites have bedeviled attempts to replace lithium-ion with advanced lithium metal batteries that last longer and charge faster. Dendrites are lithium deposits that grow into the battery’s electrolyte. If they bridge the anode and cathode and create a short circuit, the battery may fail, catch fire or even explode.

Wait, you might be thinking — isn’t electoral reform dead? Didn’t Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wipe it from the government’s agenda back in February? Kind of, but it’s not that simple. While Trudeau attempted to abandon his campaign promise of electoral reform in early February, a window of opportunity for action to strengthen our democracy remains. But that window is closing — in less than a month MPs will vote on whether to move electoral reform forward or toss it aside. It is easy to be cynical, to chastise Trudeau for yet another broken promise, to turn our backs on him as he’s done to us. But let’s not lose sight of the fact that we still have a critical opportunity to affect change. The next step on electoral reform is actually a golden opportunity for our democracy to function as it should. Rather than toeing the party line, Members of Parliament have the chance to represent their constituents and hold the prime minister accountable to his promises by voting in favour of electoral reform on May 31. A brief look back at the dialogue on electoral reform in Canada over the last two years shows us just how crucial this window is, and how we, as constituents, can influence the outcome.

Part of the reason for the inevitable decline is that, while MP3s may still occupy the music libraries of millions of listeners around the world, from a technological standpoint, the format has been eclipsed by later audio codecs that simply do a better job of compressing music into small, manageable file sizes – a point that its original creators fully acknowledge.

When they were in the front, the passage rate was only 16.67 percent. That’s based on only 60 rides on a single coaster, and Wartinger guards his excitement in the journal article: ‘Preliminary study findings support the anecdotal evidence that a ride on a moderate-intensity roller coaster could benefit some patients with small kidney stones.’” 4. “Some rides are going to be more advantageous for some patients than other rides. So I wouldn’t say that the only ride that helps you pass stones is Big Thunder Mountain. That’s grossly inaccurate.” 5. “His advice for now: If you know you have a stone that’s smaller than five millimeters, riding a series of roller coasters could help you pass that stone before it gets to an obstructive size and either causes debilitating colic or requires a $10,000 procedure to try and break it up. And even once a stone is broken up using shock waves, tiny fragments and “dust” remain that need to be passed. The coaster could help with that, too.” SCIENCE: IT WORKS  Update:  “In all, we used 174 kidney stones of varying shapes, sizes and weights to see if each model worked on the same ride and on two other roller coasters,” Wartinger said. “Big Thunder Mountain was the only one that worked. We tried Space Mountain and Aerosmith’s Rock ‘n’ Roller Coaster and both failed.”Wartinger went on to explain that these other rides are too fast and too violent with a G-force that pins the stone into the kidney and doesn’t allow it to pass.“The ideal coaster is rough and quick with some twists and turns, but no upside down or inverted movements,” he said.

Until you gently snap their tail, at least. New research has literally shed a light on the drops’ odd balance of incredible strength and fragility, revealing it all comes down to a thin skin of glass held under incredible tension. A team of researchers led by scientists from the US and UK used a beam of polarised light to measure the internal properties of the glass drops to show how a tough outer skin and the channelling of cracks make for a paradoxical object that is as tough as it is brittle. Prince Rupert’s drops are relatively simple to make; they’re little more than molten glass dropped into cold water, creating a solid blob with a long, thin tail. Smacking the fat end with a hammer, pressing it with up to 20 tons of force, or even shooting it with a gun won’t do it a lot of damage. To break it, however, you only need to tap its tail, which will cause the entire object to disintegrate into a shower of tiny shards.  Continue Reading. " False link

The final drink reflects the tea cultivar, the growing environment and how the leaves are processed - dried, crushed, steamed, blended. Farmers pluck ‘baby’leaves, as one Snapple commercial put it in the mid-2000s, to begin making white tea. And yet scientists in China, South Korea and the United States say there is another way to further tea’s potential, beyond altering the dirt or the stages of harvest or processing. DNA analysis could lead to “a more diversified set of tea flavours” by tracing the genes responsible for taste, according to Lizhi Gao, a botany professor at the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Kunming Institute of Botany. He and colleagues have completed the “first high-quality” genome of the tea tree shrub, published this week in the journal Molecular Plant. The plant took five years to analyse, thanks to the sheer number of DNA sequences involved. “The tea tree genome is extremely large,” Gao wrote in an email to The Washington Post - counting 3 billion base pairs, about four times the size of coffee’s genome.

Dating the tools proved to be challenging. However, using recent technology, including uranium dating, the team believes they have firm evidence that humans were using tools to break apart the bones and make other tools. “When you look at the evidence — the material, the nature of the wear pattern on the bones, the actual mapping of the site — the evidence is absolutely incontrovertible,” Richard Fullagar, co-author of the paper that appeared in Nature said during a teleconference.
