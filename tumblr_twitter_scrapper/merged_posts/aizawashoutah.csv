I know you’re all excited about WTTM but some people have recorded and uploaded the livestream from @aitaikimochi but she never allowed this. Since the video hasn’t been officially published yet, she can get in trouble if people shares this. The video in question has a black band on the right and you can hear some short girl’s comment in it (in the end : “  I guess I’ll play one more time”). If you see any videos closed to this description, please don’t repost or reblog. The livestream wasn’t meant to be shared this way, it was already kind enough for Audrey to show it like this.

I don’t have enough capacity for coherent thought right now to break them down, and that should probably wait for a full scan to come out. But how wonderfully they work together, and complement each other, and play off each other after like a WEEK of friendship is the stuff that shipper dreams are made of. - But for one thing, they are both so cool and nonchalant about that whole sexy af performance, that they have to be incredibly comfortable with each other to pull it off with such ease. - Everyone who thought Otabek was nothing but a quiet shy guy is IN FOR SOME SURPRISES WHOO BOY. I love him to bits either way – as the cool bad boy on a bike, or as the super-cool club DJ, or as the super-super-cool-super-extra-finger-lickin-good boy. But now he has quite a bit of depth, and every new detail we learn just makes us love him more 👍 - It’s not that often that I’ve been part of a fandom that has allowed me to see my favorite ship become canon right before my eyes. This journey over the past several months has been so beyond awesome, and for all its flaws the YOI fandom is really nothing short of amazing. I am quite certain that we made this happen by showing our support and love for Otayuri ever since that fateful day of Episode 10. - Finally, now all the haters/anti-shippers can literally go suck it (and by “it” I mean Yuri’s index finger) ☝️☝️☝️👅👅👅 " False text

I suppose you don’t care for either justice or evil…but striving to be a better person is a wonderful thing” Who had said those words to him? Dazai can’t frankly remember. He’s tries his to wrack his brain to remember who had said  those  words to him but he shoots blanks every time. Literally. He puts the gun down, then raises the gun to his temple, finger slowly tugging the trigger. Dazai hears nothing, looking down he realizes that the gun is on the floor. Bending down to pick it up, he slowly stands back up and stretches his arms out gracefully. Red hair is what catches his attention. Maybe it was one of the members playing a prank on him. “No Longer Human.” muttered Dazai, brown eyes widening when the red hair doesn’t transform. “No Longer Human.” he gritted out, panic settling in when it still stood there. “You’re right Dazai, I’m no longer human.” Red hair said. “Did you do like I asked you to?” “What are you talking about?“ “Become a good human being, save the weak,” “Protect the orphaned.” Dazai finished out, he steps back from the red hair. “WHO ARE YOU?” “You can’t remember me?” Red hair said sadly. “So you didn’t do as I asked of you? You seemed like the type of person to follow through with his word. It seems I was wrong.” " False text
