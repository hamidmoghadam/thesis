It’s a parody - and I use that word very loosely, because there’s really nothing funny about it - of Les Miserables. It’s about a failed revolution, and a barricade, and the people who fought and died there for nothing. Nothing changes. Politics with a capital P goes on, and even the most pure and noble of intentions only becomes food for the pit of snakes who pull the strings. The powerful remain powerful, the powerless, despite their solidarity, their desperation, their violence, their hope, remain powerless. Their little lives don’t count at all. Things continue exactly as they always have, minus a few faces in the crowd. It is also, I think, where we see Sam Vimes at his lowest. Sure, Thud! does similar things in stripping him down, but that is under an outside influence, and he has his family to think of. He has something to fight for. In Night Watch, though, all of that is taken away. Sam Vimes, eternal cynic, for once has Cassandraic knowledge that his cynicism is absolutely founded. He knows how this will end, and there’s no Corporal Carrot to make the world magically better around him, no Sybil and Young Sam to push through for, no city to protect. The absolute best that he can expect is to succeed, and lose that family, that future, forever. The absolute worst? He dies. Everyone he cares about here dies. And it’s all in vain. Sam Vimes is an alcoholic. It’s something that we tend to bring up when we’re talking about how amazing he is, how much he’s overcome, but gloss over otherwise. Which is a little sad, because it’s fundamental. Sam Vimes faced this exact dragon, years ago. Sam Vimes saw there was no way to slay it. He saw the ants eating at the heart of every hope, every effort. He saw the first man he really knew as a good and kind and just - but never passive, never weak - man die, horribly, slain for no reason but petty grudge and Politics. He saw John Keel’s garden wither and die in its bed. He saw the hope of a better, brighter Ankh-Morpork squelched, and the sacrifice of a good man wasted. He saw the world, in all of its rotting, miserable, pestilent despair, spoiling every good thing that dared show its face, its only ordering principle the slow decay of entropy. Young Sam Vimes had no anchor. Young Sam Vimes had nothing left to turn to but the bottom of a bottle and the smelliest part of an Ankh-Morpork gutter. Sam Vimes, as of the events of Night Watch, is back there. Not only physically temporally displaced. He has nothing. There is no reason for him to stand up, to take on the role of John Keel, to take responsibility for the barricade, to try to bring Carcer back to justice. To fight the doomed fight. There is nothing between him and finding a quiet seat at the Broken Drum, ordering himself a pint, and giving up. There is nothing between him and despair. But he gets up anyway. He intervenes anyway. He tries to help anyway, even when he can’t believe it will make any difference. And it doesn’t, in the end. Except that people lived who, save for the actions of John Keel, would have died. Except it quite literally meant the world to them. And that’s where the hope is hiding, in this hopeless, bleak, despair of a book. There is no glory. There is no revolution. There is no good thing that cannot be corrupted. There is no point. Except. The Disc turns on the ‘except’. Always has. Always will. " False text

The world needs to know.   Update 1: They’re exchanging fire from both sides. Electricity is down. Friends are reporting that ISIS members are spotted in the schools and are giving them a few minutes to evacuate before they take over. Filipino media is silent.   Update 2: Christian teachers are being held hostage.   Update 3: Hospital staff being detained, ISIS flag has been raised in the city hospital. The fighting occurred not in the outskirts of Marawi, but on its streets, around the city hall and public market. I’m sorry, I’m stringing together what information my friends are still giving me. I don’t know how long they can keep this up - a lot of them are saying that their phones are dying.   Update 4: Armed Forces of the Philippines telling people to go underground, airstrikes coming.

The military is trying to invalidate ground reports to cover up their fuckups.   UPDATE 6: Philippine National Police and Armed Forces of the Philippines are not responding or have deployed extremely delayed support, according to the Marawi City Mayor in a phone interview.   UPDATE 7: CNN Philippines has a livestream covering the entire thing, eyewitness reports are in, Military is still saying “we’re in full control” when that’s obviously not the case.  https://web.facebook.com/CNNPhilippines/videos/1933243386915551/  UPDATE 8: reports in that terrorists are targeting cell towers now.   UPDATE 9: GENERALS POINTING FINGERS AT EACH OTHER INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE.

Rule #1: Before  What happens before they kiss. Is there a conversation going on? An emotional reunion? An intimate moment? Describe what the characters are doing to lead up to the kiss or to them wanting to kiss.  Rule #2: Eye Contact  What are they looking at? Each other? The ground? The sky? Eyes are the gateway to the soul, remember? Use that to your advantage. How are they looking at each other. What do they feel when they do?  Rule #3: Body Language  How are they moving? Describe what character is doing what. Are they jittery or calm? Happy or sad? What emotions are showing through their body language? Who leans in first? Where are their hands??  Rule #4: The Kiss  Now for the big thing. How do they go into the kiss? Is it fast or slow at first? Does one grab the other’s face or is it mutual and they both lean in till their lips touch. Explain how their lips meet then show what kind of kiss it is! Is it awkward? Sloppy? Romantic? Fierce? Angry? Sad? DESCRIBE is the most important thing in this because you want to let the reader know what is going on and what is happening. Are they making out? Is it a peck? How long does it last, but don’t make any kiss too long and too detailed. We don’t need gross stuff guys…Well let’s say we don’t need three whole pages of just these two making out.  Rule #5: Afterward  What happens now? The kiss is done. It’s happened. How have they reacted? Are they shocked? Angry? In love? Explain what they’re feeling after this. Are they feeling exposed in a way or awkward? Is there sexual tension or any tension at all? Do they say anything or does one run away. This is an important step just like the others because it is still full of feeling.  After this you have succeeded in making two characters show some affection :) not every kiss scene is the same but for big ones I usually focus on those rules and they’re pretty helpful.  Hope I helped! Happy writing! " False text

It’s a great job 99% of the time and a lot of our customers are pretty neat people. Any who, middle of the day this little old lady comes up. She’s lovably kooky. She effuses how much she loves the store and how she wishes she could spend more time in it but her husband is waiting in the car (OH! I BETTER BUY HIM SOME CHOCOLATE!), she piles a bunch of art supplies on the counter and then stops and tells me how my bangs are beautiful and remind her of the ocean (“Wooooosh” she says, making a wave gesture with her hand) Ok. I think to myself. Awesomely happy, weird little old ladies are my favorite kind of customer. They’re thrilled about everything and they’re comfortably bananas. I can have a good time with this one. So we chat and it’s nice.  Then this kid, who’s been up my counter a few times to gather his school textbooks, comes up in line behind her (we’re connected to a major university in the city so we have a lot of harried students pass through). She turns around to him and, out of nowhere, demands that he put his textbooks on the counter. He’s confused but she explains that she’s going to buy his textbooks.  He goes sheetrock white. He refuses and adamantly insists that she can’t do that. It’s like, $400 worth of textbooks. She, this tiny old woman, bodily takes them out of her hands, throws them on the counter and turns to me with a intense stare and tells me to put them on her bill. The kid at this point is practically in tears. He’s confused and shocked and grateful. Then she turns to him and says “you need chocolate.” She starts grabbing handfuls of chocolates and putting them in her pile.  He keeps asking her “why are you doing this?” She responds “Do you like Harry Potter?“ and throws a copy of the new Cursed Child on the pile too.  Finally she’s done and I ring her up for a crazy amount of money. She pays and asks me to please give the kid a few bags for his stuff. While I’m bagging up her merchandise the kid hugs her. We’re both telling her how amazing she is and what an awesome thing she’s done. She turns to both of us and says probably one of the most profound, unscripted things I’ve ever had someone say: “It’s important to be kind. You can’t know all the times that you’ve hurt people in tiny, significant ways. It’s easy to be cruel without meaning to be. There’s nothing you can do about that. But you can choose to be kind. Be kind.” The kid thanks her again and leaves. I tell her again how awesome she is. She’s staring out the door after him and says to me: “My son is a homeless meth addict. I don’t know what I did. I see that boy and I see the man my son could have been if someone had chosen to be kind to him at just the right time.” I’ve bagged up all her stuff and at this point am super awkward and feel like I should say something but I don’t know what. Then she turns to me and says: I wish I could have bangs like that but my darn hair is just too curly.“ And leaves.  And that is the story of the best customer I’ve ever had. Be kind to somebody today.  " False text

Last week, Labelle was slated to host a launch event for the release of her new book Dating Tips for Trans and Queer Weirdos. After receiving thousands of threats of violence from people who said they planned on crashing the launch, though, Labelle chose to cancel it for the protection of the guests. “We had to discuss as a staff how we felt about posting the event, whether we should continue hosting the event, and given the threats of violence how, or if, we could keep people safe,” Marshall Haywood, owner of the store for the event, told CBC News. “And because it did escalate quickly, we felt that on such short notice, we couldn’t really guarantee people’s safety.”  Continue Reading.  you can support her here: https://www.patreon.com/sophielabelle  This is infuriating, because not only have they targeted this talented young author, they have targeted the shop, Venus Envy, where she was slated to speak in Halifax.

Sure, you might have written the very best book within your niche, but your sales will eventually lose momentum unless you start producing accompanying content to blast to your audience via newsletters, e-mail marketing automations, your blog, social platforms and more!Why is a carefully curated content strategy so important for authors?Stay relevantFirstly, it’s imperative that they stay in touch with their followers in order to remain relevant and keep their finger on the pulse of what’s trending and of interest to readers.Test future book ideasSecondly, there’s no better way to test which topics resonate with your readers than by producing brief sections of content about them prior to committing to writing a full book. Your content strategy is where you’ll ultimately be able to experiment with and decide on your next book’s topic.Think of the last time you read a really great book. You more than likely ended up Googling the author afterwards and landing on their website or social media platforms. Once you got to their site or Facebook account, you were delighted to see that they were offering a free mini-course to, let’s say, help readers save more money, achieve their dreams of self-employment and so on. Without hesitating, you gladly signed up and subscribed to their e-mail newsletter list. If the book provided such great value to you, chances are their post-launch content strategy would to.Now that you’re following the author, you receive first hand notifications when they create new work, announce a book launch or share interviews they’ve done with the press. This makes you become more than likely to buy their next book, engage with the content they’ve produced and share it with your own followers – further expanding that author’s reach.There’s no better time to start creating content than now!Let’s flip it back to you – the author. You had enough on your mind to write a book, so we guarantee you are creative enough to create a valuable content strategy to help promote your author brand. Not sure what to write about?

Normally I’m of the policy to ignore books I don’t like and support diverse books I do, and if you choose to keep doing that, go for it man. But I can’t. Not with this. I can’t give Marvel any money at all. Even though I adore some of their titles. I just can’t. Not until this is gone.   @vaknosh  I’m definitely done with the Netflix shows now too   Seriously @nickspencerly please go fuck yourself raw. The linked article summarizes Secret Empire #0 so you can know what’s happening in that garbage fire without feeding it your money.  “In our overview of the lead-up to Secret Empire yesterday, we talked about how Captain America was created by two Jewish artists who would go on to serve in World War II, and how the change to his character has been called out as being directly disrespectful of their contributions. The events in Secret Empire #0 double down on that disrespect by not only brazenly altering the intentions of Jack Kirby and Joe Simon, but altering the course of the fictional history of the setting they helped create, for a real war they served in.”  oh hey, this is a great opportunity to boost Colin Spacetwinks’ new essay about Marvel. it’s really well researched and has explored a lot of ground (believe it or not this bizarre fixation with pushing their weird fantasy Nazi storyline is just one of many problems the company has right now) and is the biggest proof right now that you don’t need to keep giving this crap your money and support when indie comics and webcomics are right there " False link

The number one issue I’ve encounter in reading client’s work is that their story is set in a medieval period or in a “frontier America” type world and yet their child birth settings resemble late 20th century hospital births (because that’s basically what we’ve seen on television). If your setting is historical or is an analogue to a specific period, then you need to do a bit of research to know how the baby process was handled in such time periods…” @lakritzwolf I think we talked about that  I’m glad I came across this today because seriously, pregnancy and childbirth in writing is my biggest pet peeve.  One other important thing: Contemporary birthcare varies terribly. Delivery room in a US hospital: Highly overtechnisised. Looks like a surgery to me.  Delivery room in the hospital where I gave birth to my first child in Germany: The medical equipment is behind those doors and only accessed if needed.    Don’t assume just because it’s today it’s the same everywhere because it’s not.  This really is a great point. Thank you.  I have birth to my oldest in a hospital in the US, and my hospital room looked a lot more like yours in Germany. (Your US hospital pic is very likely a C-section delivery. That’s an OR, not a standard L&D room.) Some US hospital do have much nicer birth facilities than others. So, in that same vein, don’t assume that just because it’s modern day US it’s the same everywhere, either.  The room I gave birth in was made to look like a regular bedroom. It had some medical equipment too, so kind of half way between the US surgery room and the german one. No birthing pool as it is illegal in my country due to risk of drowning  (a baby died once so they banned it.) Policy here is to intervene in the natural process as little as possible. " False link
