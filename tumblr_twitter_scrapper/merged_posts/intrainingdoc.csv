But when it gets nasty, it gets really nasty.  I started my rotation in the ED last week, and my second patient was a 4 week old with a finger fracture.  Read that again.  FOUR weeks old. Meaning that he can’t roll over, can’t crawl,  can only see about a foot in front of his face and can’t lift his head. So that fact that he reportedly just “woke up like that” sketched us all out. So we got a skeletal survey, which is a series of x-rays of every bone in the body that we get on babies when we’re concerned that they’re being abused. And the results made me literally gasp out loud and feel like I was going to vomit. 12 fractures. 9 posterior rib fractures, which happen when adult hands squeeze a baby so hard that it breaks them. Two leg fractures, which happen when an adult picks a baby up and swings them by their leg. And then the finger, which I don’t even want to imagine.   It was then my job to go tell the parents what we had found and what was going to happen now. I took care of all of my other patients first and fiddled around on my computer for a few minutes. When I finally couldn’t put it off anymore, I walked towards their room, shaking so badly I wasn’t sure my voice would work. I was so afraid of what their reactions would be. Would they scream at me? Be physically violent? Take the baby and run (it happened to another resident earlier this month!)?  ""The x-rays came back and we found multiple rib fractures and two leg fractures. They are already healed and are older than the finger injury. At this point, we are required to contact CPS and admit him to the hospital to make sure that he will be safe at home before he can leave.”  The mom was shocked beyond words and wanted to know how this could have happened. I thought “You tell me and we’ll both know,” but said “I can’t tell you how the fractures happened, I can just tell you that they’re there.” The dad had his face in his hands and… didn’t seem too surprised. I’ll never know the whole story.  When we were in med school and all deciding which field to go into, people would often say, “I can’t go into Peds because seeing kids get sick with cancer is too sad.” I disagree. Our cancer patients are some of the strongest and pure-souled people on the planet. I am so honored to get to walk along side them on their journeys, and getting to know them is one of the best parts of my job. But child abuse sucks. It keeps us up at night and makes us lock ourselves in the bathroom at the hospital to cry. It puts fire in the eyes of even the sweetest and gentlest pediatric nurses and doctors. It’s what I hate the most about my job. Child abuse is one of, if not THE, worst thing that could ever happen to a child, and is 100% preventable. There are no excuses for hurting a child and there are no excuses for turning a blind eye when you see it. Everyone who works with children has to be on high alert and always trust their instincts. If you want to learn more, check out: https://www.cdc.gov/features/healthychildren/ and https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/preventing/preventionmonth/   This is so true. Cancer isn’t the saddest part of pediatrics. It’s what adults do to children that is the worst and the saddest part.Thank you to everyone in peds for doing what you do.  " False text

For 4 years, we cram everything into our heads, a little about every specialty. In the end, we all just can’t wait to specialize in our own fields and not have to remember the majority of other stuff we memorized. We can always just consult someone else if we need help right? Well… What if you didn’t recognize the underlying problem in the first place? This week on neurology, we had a 27 year old woman who was admitted overnight for severe headache. They ended up doing a brain MRI, which showed several small diffusion weighted defects in the posterior brain consistent with strokes. We were asked to see her in the morning for evaluation of “strokes”. I was asked to read her chart and go see her. I thought it was a little odd that a healthy 27 year old had strokes, but you never know. I start reading up and see that her systolic blood pressure has been above 160 all night. They were allowing some degree of permissive hypertension for her strokes. Her creatinine was 1.4. They also assumed this was because of her elevated blood pressures. Finally, there was protein in her urine. I keep reading and notice she is 4 days postpartum. I haven’t even seen the patient yet and put the pieces together in my head. Elevated blood pressure, severe headache with visual scotomas, elevated creatinine, protein in the urine, postpartum… Holy shit, this person has preeclampsia with severe features and needs to be started on a magnesium drip immediately! I want to go into Ob/Gyn, so naturally I was a little excited that I recognized this. I immediately went to my 70 year old attending and told him this. He looked surprised, and I could tell he probably hadn’t thought about this disease in decades since usually they are admitted to ob/gyn and not neurology. He asked me to call the ob/gyn that was on. Within a few hours, she was seen and started on a magnesium drip for preeclampsia with severe features. My attending and I went to radiology and had them re-read the scan. She had PRES not strokes. This woman could have gone home on aspirin, an anti-hypertensive, and a statin with neurology follow-up and had a seizure a day later from full blown eclampsia. In the end, I learned about how one person going down the rabbit hole of one diagnosis can lead to a series of several providers going down it as well. It was a shining moment for me as a medical student, not going to lie. But it also showed me the importance of being well read and not shutting out my mind to other specialties. We all need to know a little about everything and when to realize our limits and consult someone else. And a lot of the time, medical school is the only immersive experience we will get in many of these specialties. It matters more than just learning for the sake of the shelves. " False text

They discovered that regional  cerebral blood flow is reduced in the Broca’s area – the region in the  frontal lobe of the brain linked to speech production – in persons who  stutter. More severe stuttering is associated with even greater  reductions in blood flow to this region.  (Image caption:  Broca’s area, located in the frontal lobe of brain, plays a key role  in expressive speech. Blue regions represent areas of decreased blood  flow in children and adults with stuttering when compared to fluent  healthy participants. The red areas represent relatively higher blood  flow) In addition, a greater abnormality of cerebral blood flow in the  posterior language loop, associated with processing words that we hear,  correlates with more severe stuttering. This finding suggests that a  common pathophysiology throughout the neural “language” loop that  connects the frontal and posterior temporal lobe likely contributes to  stuttering severity. Peterson, who is director of the Institute for the Developing Mind at  CHLA and a professor of the Keck School of Medicine at the University  of Southern California, says that such a study of resting blood flow, or  perfusion, has never before been conducted in persons who stutter. His  team also recently published a study using proton magnetic resonance  spectroscopy to look at brain regions in both adults and children who  stutter. Those findings demonstrated links between stuttering and  changes in the brain circuits that control speech production, as well as  those supporting attention and emotion. The present blood flow study  adds significantly to the findings from that prior study and furthermore  suggests that disturbances in the speech processing areas of the brain  are likely of central importance as a cause of stuttering. According to Peterson, the new study – published on December 30 in the journal Human Brain Mapping  – provides scientists with a completely different window into the  brain. The researchers were able to zero in on the Broca’s area as well  as related brain circuitry specifically linked to speech, using regional  cerebral blood flow as a measure of brain activity, since blood flow is  typically coupled with neural activity. “When other portions of the brain circuit related to speech were also  affected according to our blood flow measurements, we saw more severe  stuttering in both children and adults,” said first author Jay Desai,  MD, a clinical neurologist at CHLA. “Blood flow was inversely correlated  to the degree of stuttering – the more severe the stuttering, the less  blood flow to this part of the brain,” said Desai, adding that the study  results were “quite striking.” " False text

However, researchers at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine found that a large portion of female patients with this eating disorder first develop one symptom of starvation at a normal BMI. The study was published in the International Journal of Eating Disorders.  “A person’s current BMI alone may not capture the impact of weight loss on psychological symptoms in those battling an eating disorder,” said Laura Berner, PhD, lead author and fellow at the UC San Diego Eating Disorders Center for Research and Treatment.  The study found that approximately 63 percent of patients first experienced amenorrhea, the absence of menstruation, in the mild AN severity category and more than one-third reported amenorrhea at an objectively normal BMI (at or above 18.5 kg).  “Menstrual function is an indicator of starvation and physical health. Our results add to a growing body of research suggesting that patients may show signs of starvation and severe psychological symptoms before an objectively low weight is reached,” said Berner.  Signs of starvation can also include diminished vertebral strength, abnormally slow heart rate, dizziness due to unstable blood pressure, high levels of concern about body shape and weight and extreme attempts to restrict dietary intake. The study findings have implications for both early detection and intervention for AN.  “All of the women in our sample were at an objectively low weight and were receiving an intensive level of treatment for their eating disorder. However, more than a third of these patients first showed a sign of starvation at a weight that might not have alarmed most health care providers,” said Berner. “The results highlight the importance of clinician assessment of weight history, not just current weight, and awareness of serious symptoms that may appear at a normal weight and could predict severe anorexia nervosa later.”  " False text

We all know that it is expensive, but when I say “expensive,” I actually mean “entirely unfeasible for many Americans.” I didn’t really understand either until I went from being a healthy kid to being in the PICU overnight, only to leave with hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical debt before my 17th birthday (and I was fortunate enough to have insurance!). I cannot begin to describe the impact this has had on my life. I’m saying this because there’s a lot of insensitivity going around about sick people who can’t afford care… about how they are just “lazy” and want a handout, or how if they’d just get a job, they might be able to pay their medical bills without destroying their lives. Frankly, it’s bullshit. In a system like ours where care is SO outrageous, and where health insurance is a necessity to make these costs even remotely feasible, it’s not just a simple personal failing due to laziness when someone can’t afford care. Particularly in light of what is going on with the ACA, there are going to be a lot of people voicing their very cruel and frankly incorrect opinion that people who can’t afford healthcare are just lazy mooches who don’t want to get a job. A little bit of sensitivity for such a complex issue would be nice. While there’s plenty that needs to be criticized and targeted about US healthcare, the patients struggling to get life-saving treatments aren’t it, and doing so just diverts attention away from the fact that US “medicine” has become a joke. And I’m saying this as someone in the thick of it, as both a chronically ill patient and a student doctor. " False text

Sanford Guide to Antimicrobial Therapy A great deal of emergency department patients are discharged or admitted on antibiotic therapy.

It details residency life in the 1970s. You can talk about this book with almost any medical student or attending. It is practically a medical school requirement.  Intern: A Doctor’s Initiation by Sandeep Jauhar A more modern look into medicine residency intern year from the perspective of Cardiologist Dr. Sandeep Jauhar. Comes with the highs and lows you can expect. After having been through 6 months of residency, I would say it is very accurate. Gifted Hands: The Ben Carson Story by Ben Carson. Just because I find Ben Carson incompetent as a politician does not mean I do not respect him as a doctor. He is a phenomenal pediatric neurosurgeon and this book details his story. On Doctoring: Stories, Poems, Essays by Richard Reynolds A book of stories and poems from doctors throughout time and also from famous poets and authors depicting their views of medicine. Private Practice: In the Early Twentieth-Century Medical Office of Dr. Richard Cabot by Christopher Crenner An interesting look into a Boston medicine clinic from the early 1900′s. With excerpts from old patient notes which I found very interesting.  And if you have an interest is something more dark: Blind Eye by James B. Stewart The real story of a doctor murderer from the 1990′s who killed multiple patients without getting caught for several years. Devil in the White City by Erik Larson  The story of the World’s Fair in Chicago in the late 1800′s. A great look into the history of Chicago and the murderous doctor who roamed its streets. And lastly: The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams. Just a great book in general. My favorite. Suggested by other users: The Making of a Woman Surgeon by Dr. Elizabeth Morgan Suggested by http://thetay-in-the-757.tumblr.com This book is my all time favorite, as I am a female aspiring to work in the healthcare system myself. Dr. Morgan chronicles her own journey in the male-dominated arena of medicine in the 1970s and 1980s, as she struggles to maintain an appropriate balance between remaining empathetic towards her patients and yet must toe the line of not becoming too emotionally involved with her patients so that she burns out, as well as maintaining her own femininity in a man’s world. When Breath Become Air by Dr. Paul Kalanithi Suggested by http://nandemokandemo.tumblr.com When Breath Becomes Air is an autobiography written by an esteemed neurosurgeon who discovers he has Stage IV lung cancer in his final stages of residency. It appeals to not only medical students, with his profound impressions of cadaver dissection and his first life and deaths, but also to current medical professionals by questioning philosophical domains of mortality and what a meaningful life is, as well as to non-medical professionals with moving thoughts on family, life, death and meaning. It is not a novel to be missed by any person.   " False text

It has become less about making patients better, comfortable, and ensuring they get out of the hospital to go home and not leaving in a casket, to only caring about what they have to say about their “experience” during their stay. Might as well start putting hospitals on Yelp and Tripadvisor.   Our system focuses too much on patient satisfaction and less on medical skill. Less about doing what is necessary to improve someone’s medical state and more about doing everything in our power to keep them happy. And worse is Administration across the country is all about this model of practice. So the healthcare systems slap down regulation after regulation to automize us basically turning us into robots. When the medical staff isn’t walking around on their tip toes trying not to break these outlandish rules that help keep pressgany scores up the level of medical care provided improves.   Currently if our system performs poorly we lose all of our incentive bonuses at the end of the year. Last year we didn’t get anything yet everyone in admin got over a million dollars in bonus pay.

But when it comes to a point that getting a bad review because we forgot to bring you water due to the fact another patient was actively dying, and then we get more of a lecturing about the negative review instead of figuring out what we could of done better for the other patient…is absurd to me.

Next we proceeded into her exam.  The stigmata for bacterial infection were conspicuously absent.  I described my findings to her, watching her mood deflate slightly when I explained that antibiotics would not help.  I continued to work my way down her body in a systematic exam, explaining as I went.  As I came to her hands I winced.  The skin was thickened, dried, and cracked.  My hands began to hurt in sympathy. “Tell me about your hands,” I said. She responded in deeply accented English that her hands became like this after working with the nail chemicals all day.  “And do you like this job?” I asked. “I hate it,” she responded.  I continued to inquire why, if she hated her job and it hurt her skin in such a terrible way, she did not seek other employment.  “In my country I was a nurse.  But here I would have to start schooling over.  It would take twice as long because I would first have to take English classes.” She continued to explain that when coming over, many Vietnamese people worked in nail salons because that is where other Vietnamese people worked.  In other words, it was one of the few places they could get a foot in the door as untrained workers who barely spoke discernible English.  Suddenly the Dat Phan comedy bit seemed a lot less funny. “Why come to the U.S.?”  I asked.  “If you were a nurse in Vietnam, why immigrate to a place with few job opportunities.” Her answer?  She makes more here as a nail technician than a nurse in Vietnam, meaning she can send money to her family at home.  And being here gives her two teenage children a better opportunity for employment as they grow up.  In short, this woman gave up a job she enjoyed, to work in conditions she hates, in order for her family to have opportunities she never could. Long after I wrote her note and sent her on her way, my Vietnamese patient lingered in my mind.  Interestingly, the more I thought the more I realized she did fit into a stereotype, although I had placed her in the wrong one.  Perhaps it is partially true to think that many Vietnamese immigrants are nail technicians.  But I think the better way to look at immigrants, in all flavors, is with the lens of selfless hope they often bring with them, rather than the employment circumstances they often find themselves in.  She, like the most tremendous among us, gave up her life goals in order to propel her family into a new socioeconomic class.  That to me doesn’t fit the image the media promotes for immigrants, but rather the image I think of when I see working class mothers struggling for their family’s sake.  And I think that stereotype, an example of the best that people have to offer, is a stereotype I can live with.   Reminds me of a post I saw somewhere on Tumblr: Hands up for our parents that came to America with nothing and gave us everything.   Yes to all this, AND let’s be careful not to fall into the belief that it’s possible for every immigrant, or every ghetto-ized person of color to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps. We need a living wage, fair housing, health care for all, truly equitable education, and much more for folks at all levels of our very steep pyramid.

Today my attending and I called a patient’s bother and power of attorney.  We explained to him that his brother (who had multiple serious medical comorbidities) had been found in cardiac arrest after an unknown period of time, and while the paramedics had gotten his heart to start beating again, he was in very grave condition and given his multiple other health problems, we didn’t know what his chances for recovery looked like or what his quality of life would be if he did. The brother stopped us.  “I’m a doctor in (Town a few hours away)”, he said, “And he’s been miserable these past few years, being as sick as he is and going through the treatment he did.  He wouldn’t want this.  I’m leaving to drive there as soon as I hang up, but I want you to take the tube out, put him on comfort care, and if he starts to die before I get there, let him go.  Don’t put the tube back in, don’t start pressors, don’t do CPR, just let him go, I don’t want him to suffer any more for my sake.” I can only imagine how hard that must’ve been for him. We would’ve completely understood if he’d wanted us to keep his brother intubated until he got here and could be with him as he died, but he wanted us to make and keep him comfortable, instead. If my brother is ever (heaven forbid) in that same situation and I have to make a decision, I hope I’d have the compassion and strength to tell his docs to put his comfort first and foremost, let his death progress as naturally as it could, get in a car, and accept that I may not get there in time to see him alive again, but feel it is worth it so I can spare him some suffering.

First, I ask the guy if he knows what his prostate is, and then I give a brief description of the prostate: “It’s basically a racquetball wrapped around the pee-tube coming out from your bladder, and it’s also next-door neighbors with your rectum. If it’s enlarged or sick, it can block your urine flow, and it can jack up your sex function. So that’s why I’m going to ask you these questions.” THEN, when they start pinging lots of +’s on the prostate symptoms (and, I suspect, answering them more honestly because they know what I’m getting at), I add this: “Well, sure sounds like your prostate could be the cause of your X symptoms, doesn’t it? So now, we need to feel it and see if it’s swollen or tender. Now that you’re an expert on prostates, can you guess how we examine it?” Believe it or not, my male patients seem to be overall less embarrassed and apprehensive about digital rectal exams if THEY are the first one in the room to say “finger in the butthole”… because by that point, they understand WHY it’s important to do this.   Never ask “are you missing any doses,” but rather “how often do you miss a dose?” Nobody is perfect. Let’s acknowledge that so your patient doesn’t feel like they have to lie.  When you run out of questions or blank out, always feel free to ask “is there anything else you think I should know that I haven’t asked?” It will give you a few more seconds to think.  In regards to pain complaints, always ask “what were you doing when it started?” It may be useless, but you’d be surprised how often you see people for neck pain who have no clue what caused it and when you ask that question they say “painting my ceiling”. I usually start my preventive care visits with “I’m going to ask you a bunch of nosy personal questions today so I can figure out what sort of diseases you might be at risk for. If at any time you think I’ve gone too far, please tell me, or if you have a question why I would ask about XYZ, please ask.”  When asking about anxiety, I usually ask people how they feel physically when they’re really anxious. I will explain that my heart beats extra hard and fast when I’m anxious, whereas some people get an upset stomach or shortness of breath. Often that helps zoom in on some somatic issues.  If a person has a series of vague complaints or they come in for fatigue, always always ask about sleep habits. Patients will roll their eyes and say they sleep fine and then admit they sleep 4 hours a night because they keep checking Facebook all night.  If you’re asking about a distance, like how far a person can walk before they have to stop and rest, try using relative terms like “from this room to the front desk” or “across the Walmart parking lot” rather than accurate distances like 100 yards or a half mile. Folks often don’t have much perspective on how far 100 feet is.  Also: I second Cranquis’ use of basic, easy to understand terms like “pee tube” and “jack up your sex function”. You and the patient will both know what you mean. However, when a patient uses vague terms like “my down-there” areas or “my privates,” make sure you can get them to be more specific. For example, if a woman complains of pelvic pain, specify is it deep in the abdomen like menstrual cramps, on the skin outside the vagina like a rash, inside the vagina like a yeast infection, etc.  That’s alls I can think of right now.  My addition is related to asking about mental health. My program (stupidly) focuses on not using the words “mental health” or “psychiatrist” when asking about history of depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, etc. because of the “stigma” associated with having to see a mental health professional. I find this extremely ironic because their approach to lessening the stigma associated with mental healthcare is by trying to tiptoe around it by asking questions like “Have you ever seen anyone for in the past for any sort of anxiety or depression?” The problem with asking about a mental health history in this manner is that it leaves out a multitude of other reasons someone may have seen a therapist, psychiatrist, or counselor. All aspects of mental health are extremely important, and by focusing on only two diagnoses (anxiety and depression) I feel that leaves out a lot of other conditions my patient might have, ranging from schizophrenia to arousal disorders.  So, what I usually ask is, “At any point in your life have you seen a mental health professional or counselor for any reason?” And it shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Not for you. Not for the patient. I have never once had a patient get offended by me asking about their mental health history. I hate this idea that we can’t say “mental health” because of the stigma associated with the phrase “mental health.” We won’t get rid of a stigma by avoiding the phrase entirely. If anything it just worsens it.   This thread keeps getting better and better. Check out the entry by @md-admissions in a separate reblog too.   This is fantastic! I’ll add some peds stuff because that’s what I’m on right now: –if your patient is old enough to talk, ask them who they brought with them. Like, point at the adult in the room and say “who is that?” It gives you a ton of insight into their social situation without having to ask awkward questions–for example, the person you may have assumed was mom is actually auntie and now you have a perfect opening to casually ask where mom is. It’s also fantastic because kids will always say things like “that’s Dad,” and you also call the father ‘Dad,’ which is a cheap but effective way to get a laugh out of a school age kids. –when you’re asking about developmental history, especially in the inpatient/urgent care/ER seeing, ask if anyone has ever been concerned about the child’s growth or development. It’s a quick way to assess for any major issues, then you can go through age-appropriate screening as needed. A surprisingly high number of people have told me that, yeah, little Johnny did need speech therapy for a year now that you think about it.  –Social history in teens is super awkward, always. I start the conversation by asking about what their friends are doing–kids are much more likely to admit that their friends are drinking than tell you about their own drinking habits. It also gives you a great judgement-free avenue for education–you can talk about stupid things their friends have done while drinking and how to avoid them while still reinforcing to the teen that drinking can be dangerous.  This is beautiful. Keep on keeping on!" False text

(Image caption:  Astrocytes are shedding light on neurodegeneration caused by a range of diseases) Astrocytes  have long been implicated in the pathology of a range of human  neurodegenerative diseases or injuries including Alzheimer’s,  Huntington’s Parkinson’s disease, brain trauma and spinal cord injury. But how they are produced and what their roles in disease may be, has been as yet unknown. This paper  provides an understanding of the mechanism involved and for the first  time provides hope that a lot of these diseases may in fact be  treatable. The study, published recently in Nature and led by  researchers at The University of Melbourne and Stanford University,  provides deeper understanding of the functions of injured or  diseased astrocytes found in the Central Nervous System (CNS) following  acute injury and chronic neurodegenerative disease. In a healthy brain, astrocytes are vital for the normal functioning  of the brain - providing nutrients to support neuron viability,  releasing factors that aid formation of connections between nerve  cells known as synapses, as well as many other important functions. One puzzle has been that in some circumstances the astrocytes appear  to have a toxic effect on neurons, whereas in others they support  neuronal viability and connectivity. Researcher Dr Shane Liddelow from the University of Melbourne’s  Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, and the Department of  Neurobiology at Stanford University, said astrocytes are often  characterised as ‘helper’ cells but they can also contribute to damage  caused by brain injury and disease by turning toxic and kill other types  of brain cells. “These apparently opposing effects have been a puzzle for some time.  By characterising two types of astrocytes this paper provides some  answers to the puzzle,” he said. “Following nerve damage, astrocytes form scar tissue that can help in  the regeneration of severed fibres. But we have also discovered that  under certain conditions, they can turn and become negatively reactive,  causing cell death,” Dr Liddelow said For many decades, the trauma and neurodegeneration research focus has  been on neurons. Researchers are excited by the discovery of these  neurotoxic reactive astrocytes, because for the first time, these  findings imply that acute injuries of the retina, brain and spinal cord  and chronic neurodegenerative diseases, may all be much more treatable  and even reversible than first thought. By providing new insights into the process of neurodegeneration,  researchers can look at new pathways for dealing with neurological  diseases and injuries, by targetting these toxic astrocytes, in addition  to neurones in neuropsychiatric diseases or oligodendrocytes as for  instance in multiple sclerosis. Ultimately, there is still hope that one day it may be possible to  switch back astrocytes from the “toxic” to the “helper” state, a long  term target for Dr. Liddelow and colleagues. " False text

Break your workload down ito manageable chunks. Prioritize. Schedule your time realistically. Begin studying early, with an hour or two per day, and slowly build as the exam approaches.  2. ‘I’ve Got So Much to Study…And so Little Time"" Preview. Survey your syllabus, reading material, and notes. Identify the most important topics emphasized, and areas still not understood. Previewing saves time, by helping you organize and focus in on the main topics.  3. “This Stuff is so Dry, I can’t Even Stay Awake Reading It” Get actively involved with the text as you read. Ask yourself, “What is important to remember about this section?” Take notes or underline key concepts. Discuss the material with others in your class. Stay on the offensive.  4. “I Read It. I Understand It. But I Just Can’t Get it To Sink In” Elaborate. We remember best the things that are most meaningful to us. As you are reading, try to elaborate upon new information with your own examples. Try to integrate what you’re studying with what you already know. You will be able to remember new material better if you can link it to something that’s already meaningful to you.  Chunking: Example: to remember the colors in the visible spectrum, Rog G.Biv –> reduce the information the three “chunks”. Mnemonics: Associate new information with something familiar.  5. “I Guess I Understand It” Test yourself. Make up questions about key sections in notes or reading. Examine the relationships between concepts and sections. Often, imply by changing section headings you can generate many effective questions. 6. “There’s Too Much to Remember” Organize. Information is recalled better if it is represented in an organized framework that will make retrieval more systematic.  Write chapter outlines of summaries; emphasize relationships between sections.  Group information into categories or hierarchies, where possible. Information Mapping. Draw up a matrix to organize and interrelate material.  7. “I Knew It A Minute Ago” Review. After reading a section, try to recall the information contained in it. Try answering the questions you made up for that section. If you cannot recall enough, re-read portions you had trouble remembering. The more time you spend studying, the more you tend to recall. Even after the point where information can be perfectly recalled, further study makes the material less likely to be forgotten entirely. How you organize and integrate new information is still more important than how much time you spend studying.    For more follow How To Study Quick!!  " False text
