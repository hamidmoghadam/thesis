Jaebum Shy Jaebum has appeared once again! The first time you kissed his cheek, you may not get much of a reaction because he’s trying to keep his cool. The more you did it though, the more comfortable with it he would be. Eventually, he may come to even look forward to the small sign of affection, but he’d never let you know that. Mark Mark would act a lot like Jaebum at first, but I don’t think he’d warm up to the idea as much. He may tolerate it as a greeting, but anything beyond that he may be a bit uncomfortable with. He seems like the type to give cheek kisses to his S/O, but may not be down to receive them from anyone except family. Mark may talk about it with you if his subtle hints weren’t enough to get the point across. Jackson Jackson would be SHOOK the first time you did it, but only for about .5 seconds. He would love the affection, and may come to reciprocate it. Every time you kissed his cheek, he’d devolve into a mushy mess. Jackson would start doing much more aegyo than usual around you, in hopes of getting a cheek kiss in return. Beware of the lengths this boy would go for his best friend’s affection. Jinyoung This little tease Jinyoung, I swear. Once he realized these cheek kisses were a habit of his best friend’s, he’d learn how you acted right before you kissed his cheek so he could anticipate it. From turning his head away to dead-ass looking you in the eye and raising an eyebrow, he’d make the simple action much more embarrassing. But his reaction whenever you succeeded in catching him off guard would make all of the teasing worth it. Youngjae Youngjae would come to love your cheek kisses, but only in private. He didn’t like the fact that you two always got the classic, “You two are so cute together!” or the “When did you guys start dating?” whenever you did it in public, so he’d ask you to keep the cheek kisses for private places. Regardless, he’d get all giggly every time, and just might try giving you a cheek kiss in return one day, who knows. BamBam Another member of the flustered crew, he’d get super happy and shy whenever you kissed his cheek. There were times when he’d be a tease, but for the most part I see him covering his face with his hands and trying to hold back a little squeal. You have just unlocked soft BamBam, congrats. Yugyeom Listen, this one is very split for me. If you’re tall enough to reach this boy’s cheeks without a stool or something, he’d get all soft and giggle. But if you fall into the other side, get ready for Evil Maknae!Yugyeom to RISE. Each time you tried and failed to kiss his cheek, he’d be worse than Jinyoung with his teasing. He may even rest his hand on your head, stopping you in your tracks just to tease you. Either way, this boy would let you kiss his cheek, secretly adoring it. REQUESTS ARE OPEN! " False text

From the store or wherever..“- you’ll try to go with him but he’ll take a step back from you and tell you no- “Just stay here, I’m coming right back”- liar- he comes back but after 2am- brings you some marshmallows though and tosses them into your lap where you’re sat on the bed, this giant ass bag of big fluffy sugar puffs and an entire gallon of milk he just sets on your nightstand - “what are these for?”- but he’s already collapsed on his side, shoes and jacket still on, and fallen asleep- he’d try to stay out as much as possible- leave the house for work earlier than usual and stay longer at night- he wont say much- he wont leave, but he’s practically gone mute other than the occasional ‘do you need something? I’m out’ or an unexplained apology- six months of silent Yugyeom- he’s just really scared- you got bigger every day - the kid started kicking and he couldn’t even celebrate the occasion with you because it only scared him more- two weeks before you’re due date you’d start having contractions- and he’d be so good- grab the keys and the over night bag- lead you outside- shout angrily at the fans that were crowded around in front of your building, shove a few paparazzi when they get too close to you- it’s the most he’s said though and you felt safer when he was being aggressive like that- don’t think he knows how to drive but he takes you by himself anyway - carries you inside and refuses the wheelchair a nurse rushes over- “I’m not putting her down get us to a room”- talks to you the whole way- “Baby I’m here”- “I’ll have them give you medicine okay, soon it will all go away”- the epidural he asks demands for knocks you out completely and he just sits by your bed and holds you hand and brushes your hair back from your forehead- you’d wake up to him asleep, hunched over leaned against the mattress, still squeezing your hand- you’ll probably have to wait 5 hours until you’re fully dilated but he wont leave you- the boys will show up eventually and you’ll force them to get Yugyeom some food bc “just because I cant eat doesn’t mean you shouldn’t”- he’ll get nervous all over again when the baby starts coming- and finally, finally, cry when you’re handed your son- refuses to hold him though- “No, no. I’m going to drop him y/n he-”- you have to practically shove the baby into his arms- he’ll affectionately laugh down at him once he has him properly situated, tears in his eyes - bc your son was two weeks earlier he’s premature and so so small in big Yugyeom’s hold- “He’s so tiny..”- Will happily kiss your cheek and gets his tears all over you face but will just laugh it off- take him home the next week- yugyeom’s fucked up, messy hair, bags under his eyes, hoodies and sweats all from just the first week- the cameras love that shit though- he doesn’t get angry at them this time because his son is sleeping in the car seat he’s carrying so he just leaves them alone, tells them to give you space- drives home- tucks you in and lets you sleep - then when you wake up and take a quick shower, you go out and find your boys asleep on the living room floor- same position and everything, laid on their stomachs, head rested on their arms - SAME CLOTHES TOO YUGYEOM IN GREY SWEATS AND GREY HOODIE AND YOUR SON IN A GREY ONESIE HOW CUTE- you gotta take a picture and post it omg it’s so precious- suddenly there’s deep mumbling- “Babe, if you post that I’m going to hurt you”" False text

Buy her a burger and then just casually drop it”“Just be straight forward about it. Tell her you like her and if she likes you back take her out”he would probably go with Mark’s being cool and lowkey waybut he would fail bc damn I just don’t see him succeeding so he would want to buy you a burger but then forget and then he would try the convenience store and think to himself that a cream cheese Sandwich would do the jb right?wrongso he meets you and is like “Yeah I got that for me- no wait for you. I bought this for you”and you would take it and be like“Aw thank you but I’m lactose intolerant”And he’ll just malfunction a little“Mark told me that would work and I should just be lowkey and cool about liking you! And now I forgot you are lactose intolerant!”and you just looked at him while biting your lip and he kept complaining so you just shushed him “I like you too Yugyeom”And his eyes were suddenly as big as his fake confidenceand there was this awkward silence for a second and then he was like“Can I hug you?”and you nodded and laghed at how cute that was like awwwwwwwwwand then he excuses himself because he needs to use the toiletBUT THAT’S JUST A LIE he actually texts into the 97′liner group chat and probably calls Bambam or somethingthe other members have two moodseither it’sJinyoung and JB in the living room with you while Yugyeom was on the toilet or smthand it was dead silent while they looked at you judginglythe clock on the wall made the only soundand you’d just sit there and look at your kneesand then JB would be protective as he is“Bring him back by 10″“Yes ma’- sir. Yes sir!”silence and then Yugyeom would finally come in and be like “Whut’s goin on”you had no idea tbh “Before you go. I don’t want to be a grandfather so protect”“Don’t have sex at all. Jaebum what kind of values do you try to teach our children?”And then the two start bickering and Yugyeom just slowly pulls you awaybut the two don’t want to be mean they just want to protect their youngestbut then on the other hand you would have Bamba who’s just like “Get fucked!”He would put a lot of thought into dates but don’t mention itlike not bc he is humble but because he will deny itso hardlet’s say he took you out to a restauranthe would request the flowers on the table to be your favourite but if you asked he would go“What??? Don’t be delusional!!”but you knowOne time you took him ice skatingturns out he can’t ice skate but felt too daMN COOL TO ADMITso now he stand stiff on the ice while you push himbut if you speed up even a bithe will be full o panting and fearing for his life“Stop Y/N or I will just sit down and pull you down with me!”he is just bluffingyou thought and didn’t slow down and then suddendly it’s like a tower fell and inevitably you fell too and now everyone is staring at the human mass on the floor  quietly swearing at each otheryou decide it would be good to just go for a coffee toosometimes you two would just lay around and suddenly he goes“how many chilis do you think I can fit in my mouth?”and you are just like “Yugyeom don’t you will regret that so much!”and he is just like “ok.ok.ok”the next day bambam facetimes you to show you Yugyeom crying while drinking milk “I don’t even feel sorry for you I told you!”out of pure interesst you would want to know how many he could put in though“3″He would be super caring for you thoughalways making sure you ate and drank and slept enoughif you were out together and a breeze hit he would immediatly throw a piece of his clothing around you“i’m not even cold!”“yes but I don’t want you to get sick!”If you ever got sick thougheven if it was just the slightest stuffed nosehe get’s you enough medicine to cure the entire nation and a preach about that one time four months ago you went out with slightly damp hair and how he told you it will get you sickFor skinship he would love holding youlikehe would bury you in his bodywould love leaving little kisses in your face randomlyhe would bite you toobut god if his members would be even Closehe is two meters away from youyou better know he would not see the end of it if the members would see him even just brushing a body part of yoursI think he would also like to be the small spoon every now and thenwith his head on your chest and his arms around your waist while talking to youabout his dreams and hopesand also his worriesand you would need to reassure and soothe himhe would be there for you alwaysand while he wouldn’t want to come across sappy 22/7there would be those moments he would get serious and tell you things like“I’m always there for you!”“No matter what it is you can come to me and I will help you with it!”“You mean the world to me!”“I love you”But especially saying “I love you” would be special to him and he wouldn’t want to say it too oftenyou knew when he did he really meant itmore often then not you would be teasing each other“Hey dumbfuck pass me the salt”“Why you need salt you have enough in your soul”“Sweet how you think you can diss me”“Sweet how you think I can’t”and if anyone doesn’t know it’s just your basic way of communication they’ll be like “Are they fine?”and Jinyoung is just standing there like“Susan wht do you mean that’s young love on it’s peak. Look at them bickering. Love birds”I feel like fights would happen quite regularly but they are more just petty, stubborn, heated convos and they don’t last long10 minutes maxhe would show you dances he is working on and sometimes bc he is a little fucker™he would show you dances that are waaaaaay too sexyand then you sit there like “what is that?”“just a choreo what do you mean?”sometimes you would see him Play with Coco and giggle like a small Boyor curl up while sleeping while his mouth slightly openand you think about how cute and adorbly he isand other times you remember that one If You Do Performanceand yeah uhm so much about cute YugyeomOverall: Dating Yugyeom would be full of fun an laughter.

Sometimes silence is best to observe and watch what you need to hear or be taught. A loving silence often works best than meaningless words. Jaebum; Jaebum has taught me that leadership is practiced, not so much in words, but as in attitude and actions. It’s important to make a team work. And although your team may not always need a leader, set out to make a difference. It’s not about the role but about the ending goal. Jackson; Jackson has taught me that you should always stick to your one true dream in life. No matter what you have to give up or leave, never give up on your dreams. Don’t be afraid to fail; Be afraid of not ever trying. Also to not take life too seriously; Laugh, cry, and always have fun. Jinyoung; Jinyoung taught me It’s okay to still doubt oneself even with success in life. It’s important to test. The way to discover secrets is to be a student of your own efforts. Youngjae; Youngjae has taught me to never underestimate your strength, never overestimate your weakness. Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. It isn’t always about having the prettiest face. It’s about having a pretty mind, a pretty heart, and most importantly, a pretty soul. BamBam; BamBam has taught me not to care what other think. Don’t waste time worrying and trying to act different just to please others. Do you, and the people who accept it are the ones who truly matter. It’s okay to make mistakes as long as you learn from them. Yugyeom; Yugyeom has taught me that it’s good to be outspoken and blunt  but there’s a very fine line between being rude and honest. Never confuse the two. Theres a time to play and a time to stop and listen. As a whole Got7 has taught me that fame and fortune don’t matter in the end, just as long as you’re happy. Success is the result of perfection, hard work, and learning from failure, loyalty, and persistence. Always keep a goal you’re trying to reach. Be grateful for the things you have and the people who helped you along the way. Stay healthy by not skipping meals, appreciate your family and love unconditionally. Thank you Mark, Jaebum, Jackson, Jinyoung, Youngjae, BamBam, and Yugyeom. " False text
