Lmao @ people who think I’m ridiculous for this post. I’m defensive because alcoholism is a huge issue. Everywhere in the world. Not to mention, I know it’s hard for some of you fucks to believe because of how widely accepted alcohol is, but there are a HUGE amount of people who have personal issues with alcohol. Either being recovering or previous alcoholics themselves, having a close personal tie with someone who abused alcohol, growing up in an unstable alcoholic household, having DEEPLY EMBEDDED family or spouse issues ALL because of alcohol. FUCK OFF with your me being so offended bullshit. Just assume people are sober till you find out on **their** terms they aren’t. Don’t expect that everyone likes to drink. Just like you wouldn’t expect that everyone likes to smoke cannabis, why would you do it with alcohol? (That’s rhetorical, it’s obviously because basically everyone assumes the entire world enjoys drinking). It’s not hard. Don’t offer people drinks unless you know they drink. BYE.  My favorite response when I tell people im straight edge is “what? You’ll never drink ever? Not one drink? I don’t believe you.” And they’ll laugh And I’ll look them straight in their fucking eye and tell them both my parents, and my aunt are recovering alcoholics. The rest of my family? Has never tried, nor ever got the chance to recover from their addiction.  It’s by some miracle my mother is alive right now because she drank so much her liver stopped working. She was in a coma for two weeks. The doctors almost gave up on her. My dad was an abusive drunk and then turned to hard drugs and that certainly didn’t help anything. My 3 younger sisters and I were almost put into foster care because of the both of them. I was only about 14 at the time. Making my youngest sister, 7. And because of all of this my family went bankrupt and we were almost homeless. All because of drinking :)  That usually shuts them up real fucking fast but, I shouldn’t have to explain that to anyone. I shouldn’t have to defend my (perfectly healthy!) choices!  If someone tells you they don’t drink, it’s for a fucking reason. Don’t be a dick. Casual alcoholism is a huge fucking problem in the world and its scary that most people can’t see it.  Also, some people just… don’t like drinking. There are people out there who just genuinely do not enjoy drinking alcohol. They don’t like the taste, they don’t like being impaired, and they have no desire to try to force themselves into enjoying it just because someone else thinks it’s “weird”. There are all kinds of reasons that someone might not choose to drink, and all of those reasons are valid. There’s nothing wrong with it, it doesn’t mean they “can’t have fun”, and I guarantee you they’re not judging you for drinking. And if they are? It’s definitely not as much as they’re being judged for not drinking. Don’t try to force people to drink. Don’t assume everyone likes to drink. And if someone says they don’t drink? Don’t force them to explain why just to get you to stop hounding them.  There are plenty of reasons to avoid booze and the particulars of someone’s reasons are none of your business.  Nobody deserves to catch crap because they don’t imbibe. " False text

You have, with your pure ignorance and refusal to understand the way the government and the world works, allowed a power-hungry business tycoon to take over the United States of America. “The land of the free, the home of the brave, under God, indivisible, with Liberty and Justice for ALL.”You are HYPOCRITES.Restoring the America-that-was is only stagnating the progression of our consciousness. You voted for a person who built an 18-month campaign off the back of your hatred. He manipulated ALL of you with such ease by speaking to the darker parts of you that had started to feel ashamed about the way you viewed the “politically correct” world. He became your champion, because he spoke to the parts of you that think you are superior to the rest of us (just like Hitler did in Germany before the Holocaust! Just read his autobiography: Mein Kampf).This politically correct world we’ve created, which is really just a world with social etiquette, where we have weeded out the language of racism and explained why, where we have established feminism as a growing notion of making women realize their validity and right to be treated as the full complex beings they are and men the same (which clearly needs A LOT of work considering how women across America, especially white women, voted for this man who insulted your very existence every time he opened his mouth or disrespected Hillary during his campaign), where we have had to create numerous labels to help queer people who didn’t fit the cis heterosexual mold feel valid and identified in a world where narrow-minded consciousness has made them feel invalid and invisible for so long. That’s the “politically correct” behavior you wanna get rid of? You wanna restore America to a world where the human beings around you feel scared to be themselves and live and love freely?Apart from how selfish that is, it is so very un-CHRIST-like, because your God is watching and He knows your hearts and He is aware of the true reason you chose such a human to run the most powerful country in the world, and I promise you the God that I have come to know and love is intolerant of judgment and hatred. And I know this, because I was raised Roman Catholic in a Latin household and went to private Catholic school my whole life so I have studied WAY more than most of you have studied the religion or the Bible for that matter. The ONLY reason is your inability to accept the growing world around you. You chose hatred. Your heart chose to separate yourself as a superior when the only superior in existence in this entire universe is SO much greater than you.Our “political correctness” that your champion, Donald Trump, so pointedly disregarded throughout his entire campaign and now with the appointment of his advisors and other government officials, is the language we have worked tirelessly to establish to feel safe in a world that never stops reminding us we are minorities. I am a bisexual Cuban-American woman and I am so proud of it. I am proud to be part of a community that only projects love and education and the support of one another. I am proud to be the granddaughter and daughter of immigrants who were brave enough to leave their homes and come to a whole new world with a different language and culture and immerse themselves fearlessly to start a better life for themselves and their families.I am proud to be a woman. Proud that the sex between my thighs provides a strength and resilience in me that only other women can feel, that my body curves in ways that allow me to create life within me, that my entire life is filled with adversity and doubt and people questioning my intelligence and my artistic potential and my expression of myself and my virtue and honor because I am too much woman. I am proud that I get to prove them all wrong. I am proud that I have to work even harder for it. I was raised to feel that I can do ANYTHING, and I will always believe that. I am proud to feel the whole spectrum of my feelings and I will gladly take the label of “bitch” and “problematic” for speaking my mind the same way any man would be admired and respected for doing. But, I will also extend the fullest hand of compassion and empathy for anyone labeling me as such.I also know that in my struggle of being a woman I am so very privileged. I was born with a lighter complexion and green eyes (thanks genetics) so from that narrow-minded perspective, I’m white. I have experienced the privilege those genes have granted me, and I am grateful and will continue to speak on behalf of the women around the world and in our very own country who do not experience a fraction of that respect because of the color of their skin or what they choose to wear, or how their hair looks, or how much makeup they have on or any other absurdity that we women are reduced to.It’s truly disheartening to me to see so many beautiful women who have no idea what their potential is. This election made it blatantly obvious just how many women can’t see it. We have failed ourselves as a nation. We are the example for the world, and we have failed our fellow humans who were watching us with hope that we would not allow hatred to prevail. I have had the privilege of being in a band that has allowed me to travel all over the world. I cannot express the gratitude I have for this experience because it opened my eyes to so many things and has allowed me to view the world from such a simple perspective, a perspective that I understand not very many people have the opportunity to experience.If I could tell every Trump supporter two things, it would be to travel and read a history book. Look beyond yourselves, look at how petty the morals you uphold seem when you realize we are not the only ones. Realize that your white skin is the result of immigration from Europe, that the only true “Americans” are Native Americans, who are indigenous people that inhabited this land before these conquerors from other countries (England, France, Italy, Spain) wiped them out almost entirely. None of us belong here but all of us deserve the right to feel safe and live our lives in peace. To not have to worry about potentially dying, or being electro-shocked, or beaten, or raped, or emotionally abused because our existence and/or choices for ourselves upset someone else. This is the world Trump is fostering. This is the division that has risen since the beginning of the campaign. We are not America indivisible any longer, we are united on two separate sides; Love and Hatred. We are not “whining” about our presidential choice losing, we are screaming battle cries against those whose political and personal agendas threaten our lives and sanity. We are making sure you hear us, no matter how much it bothers you, we EXIST." False link

While  Donald Trump is a bumbling political idiot, Mike Pence is actively  against the people and possibilities that we need to help America to  have a strong future. His career has been built on hateful exclusion,  not intelligent inclusion. Here are some things that every voter should know about Mike Pence: - Science and invention helped build America, but Mike Pence is 100% anti-science.  He chooses not to accept the preponderance of evidence that supports  anthropomorphic climate change, and he thinks schools should be required  to teach Christian “creationism” mythology alongside evolution in  science classrooms. - Mike Pence is anti-environment.  As governor, he has vetoed every piece of environmental regulation that  has crossed his desk. He doesn’t want the EPA to regulate greenhouse  gases, and he does want to open up pretty much every part of our country  to oil and coal companies. No more wildlands under Pence. He is one of  those irresponsible extremists who think that God gave us the world so  we could just use it up, and when it is all used up the second coming  will occur. There is no Biblical basis for this belief. - Females make up more than half of the American population, but Mike Pence is anti-woman.  He has said the Disney movie “Mulan,” which was based on a centuries  old Chinese poem, was the work of a “mischievous liberal” trying to  groom young children to accept women in combat. “Despite her delicate  features and voice, Disney expects us to believe that Mulan’s ingenuity  and courage were enough to carry her to military success on an equal  basis,” he wrote on his radio show’s website. - He obsessively pursues a personal vendetta to take Title X funding  away from Planned Parenthood because Planned Parenthood provides  abortion services. Title X money CANNOT be used for abortions. Abortions  are paid for by the recipient or through private, tagged donations.  Taking away Title X will not impact abortion services, but it would  leave thousands of women without access to cancer screenings or birth  control.  - Speaking of birth control, Mike Pence once again revealed his historical ignorance in saying that condoms are “modern” and “liberal.”   He thinks all women should be pregnant unless they can’t afford a baby,  in which case they should abstain from sex, even if they are married.  That’s right: sex is only for procreation in PenceWorld. If you can’t  afford the diapers, then hubby should be sleeping on the couch. - Mike Pence is also anti-gay,  to the point of denial. He doesn’t want the government to pay for  cancer screenings, but he does want the government to pay for abusive  “conversion therapy” programs that systematically undermine the victim’s  self-esteem, and then indoctrinate them into robotic gender-appropriate  behaviors. He has signed into law a bill that allows discrimination  against LGTBQ customers based on religious belief. - As governor of Indiana, Mike Pence was personally responsible for an outbreak of AIDS when he refused to allow clean needle exchanges for drug addicts. Instead, he asked people to pray for the addicts. - Mike Pence is racist.  He thinks there is “too much talk” about institutional racism in law  enforcement because “police officers are human beings.” His solution is  unity through “faith.” The Indiana governor has tried to prevent Syrian  refugees from settling in his state because the “pose a threat to safety  of residents.” Pence argued that his policy was based on fear, not  race, so it wasn’t discriminatory. A Federal Appeals Court dismissed his  racist arguments on October 3, 2016. - A Federal Court also had to block his bizarre anti-abortion law  that required burial or cremation for fetuses, whether miscarried or  aborted, no matter how far along the pregnancy had progressed.  - Mike Pence is pro-birth, but not pro-life.  He once funneled $3.5M dollars from Temporary Assistance to Needy  Families into programs that counsel against abortion. He wants those  women to have those babies, but he doesn’t care if the kids starve or  live on the streets afterward. - Mike Pence has refused to comply with federal guidelines aimed at reducing prison rape. When  you add it all together, you can see that the most dangerous part of  the Trump-Pence ticket is …that calculating quiet man who will be leading the charge from behind. Mike Pence is basically against anyone who is not white, conservative, Christian, and male. When  Mike Pence was a young lawyer on the rise, he challenged a longtime  Democratic congressman for a seat in a Republican-leaning Indiana  district. He seemed to have it in the bag until voters were stunned to  learn that he had been using political donations to pay personal  expenses including the mortgage on his house, his credit card bill,  groceries, golf tournament fees, and car payments for his wife.” http://www.smobserved.com/story/2016/10/10/opinion/mike-christian-sharia-pence-is-scarier-than-donald-trump/2081.html " False link
