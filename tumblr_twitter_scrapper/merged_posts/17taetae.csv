17taetae 160088023237 "2017-04-28 16:24:32 GMT" https://17taetae.tumblr.com/post/160088023237/never-me "kpopbrowniefics: “Hobi pass me that flower.” Hoseok stood behind her on the ladder his hands itching to grab her thighs and steady them and not the cold metal of the ladder. As he handed her another satin rose which she pinned to a sequined garland, he leaned his head back and enjoyed the view. How he salivated when he thought about palming her ass. He couldn’t though, that would be wrong and it wasn’t his place. “What do you think?” She asked, looking down at him right as his eyes met hers.“Looks good, you know you’re good at this kind of stuff. I’m sure he’ll like it.” He backed away from the ladder, as she motioned for him to back up so she could come down. “He better, hell it’s not like I busted my ass on this.” She crossed her arms over her chest, the oversized sweater she wore looking cute on her body. Hoseok flicked her cheek gently. “Namjoon isn’t as picky as you think.”Rolling her eyes, she scoffed. “Not as picky as you think. Don’t let his chicken wing dance moves fool you, he’s a stickler for detail.” She laughed, grabbing the ladder to put it away. Hoseok sighed, rushing over to take it from her. “Be careful.” “I’m not a baby.” Grinning as she spoke but she let him take it. She had been friends with Hoseok for awhile now, just friends and she never thought to look at it more than that. Now, she wouldn’t lie to herself, when she first saw him she’d swear she’d sleep with him but after getting to know him? He was a better friend, he could be depended on. He was loyal, he gave good advice and best of all he knew when to hug and console. Hoseok on the other hand was always trying to work his way into her life, but he didn’t know how and it seemed like whatever he did, he did it wrong. It ended up as friendship and this was not where he wanted to be. Then she met Namjoon, in the beginning he was worried about Jin. Jin who was so charismatic and handsome, but in the end she fell for Namjoon and he fell hard for her. Now he was on the sidelines wondering at which point exactly should he have just come out with what he wanted to say. “He’s going to be back tonight are you sure?” She looked at Hoseok as he closed the store closet door behind him. “He told me tomorrow, but I know he might be trying to surprise me.” “Jin is picking him up, he’s going to be home tonight. You’re that excited?” He didn’t mean to sound snarky but she caught it, raising an eyebrow. “What’s wrong?” Once again mistaking her friend’s attitude for the lack of time they would spend together. “You know I loved hanging out with you, and we do this all the time, but you’l have to forgive me while I snuggle with Namjoon for a bit.” Hobi gritted his teeth. “Naw..” Letting his bright smile take over his face again. “I just liked when it was us two chillin and not Mr. I-know-everything.” She laughed. “He can be a bit of an asshole, but he’s your best friend and my boyfriend. We can call him on it and move on.” She was oblivious and it annoyed him to no end. How could she not know? How could she ignore the way he looked at her, the way the light hit her hair and she looked like a goddess. They way she smiled and her dimples sunk in. Her laugh, how she tossed her head back and the smooth skin of her throat called to him. Hoseok closed his eyes and took a deep breath.She was busy setting the table for later, laying out forks neatly as she looked at the clock. He was going to be here in two hours. She had enough time to take her twists out, clean up, put on that racy outfit she bought and sit around the house waiting to pounce on him when he came home. Hobi watched her bend over the table, her tight calf muscles bunching. Closer he walked, right behind her so that when she stood up she bumped into him, turning around. “Can I help you? Jesus, move Hobi.” Laughing as she pointed to the table. “It all comes together right?” Taking her hand, Hoseok brought her fingers to his lips. “What is it that you love so much about him? He’s arrogant and self righteous at times.”She tried to take her hand back, frowning her face. “What’s up with you Hobi, are you trying to tell me something? Is he cheating?”“Would that make you leave him?” He pulled her closer, but she dug her heels in.“I want to know what you know, why you’re acting like this.” Her heart beat hard in her chest, Hobi would tell her, he wouldn’t let her go through all this and look like a fool. Wouldn’t he?“I just think…I know you’re better than…I’ve always wanted you.” He snatched her close to him, pressing his lips to hers. She fought him, a fisted hand hitting his chest. Once, twice until she stopped. He brought his other hand around her waist, holding her close until she stopped moving. Her lips once steel under his, were now soft. Hobi kept kissing her, his mouth moving around hers, god this was all he wanted. He pressed his body into hers, letting her feel the growing length forming in his jeans. He could please her just as well as Namjoon could. Just around the corner, flowers in hand Namjoon froze about to say something when he sucked in a harsh breath wondering where everything went wrong. Hoseok…>>>….He breathed hard, and blinked even harder trying to rid his eyes of the scene before him, she was fighting and then nothing. He felt a tear slip down his cheek as he bit his lip. A pain in his hand brought his attention back to the white roses he held, thorns biting into his fingers he dropped the bouquet and walked back out the door.Just as Hoseok pulled away, he smiled unprepared for the slap that echoed in the quiet room. “Are you done?” She asked him.Grabbing his cheek, he stumbled back. “What the hell! You were letting me!” “I stopped fighting you because you were hurting me.” Tears in her eyes, she blinked hard trying to push them away. “What are you doing?!”“Showing you how much I want you! How much better for you I am!” Hoseok screamed at her, pointing to himself. “Me and you are more alike than you are with him!” “Stop comparing yourself to him! Stop acting like you know me so well and you know what is compatible with me! Leave Hoseok, go now.” She wiped her face and her mouth with the back of her sleeve. That hurt. Watching her remove his kiss as a child would. Remove the trace of him from her mouth, so that she couldn’t taste him later. Then she broke down, sliding to the floor her face in her brown hands as she cried.He felt conflicted, he didn’t want to see her like this, but…he couldn’t take not telling her any longer. Hobi looked from the door to her. He reached out wanting to hold her, his fingers barely touching her twisted down hair when she slapped his hand away. Her eyes filled with venom as she spat out. “I said leave!” Fine. He would go, and keep everything he knew to himself. Fuck her, fuck Namjoon as well. Why did he never get what he wanted? Why was he always second string to Namjoon? Second string to everyone, he wanted to hit something. As he walked towards the door, her sobbing got louder, he heard a soft crunch under his foot and looked down seeing white roses. When did these get here? The slightly ajar door told him what he needed to know. They had been seen. She sat on the floor for what felt like an eternity until her knees began to ache. Standing up she felt them pop and she glanced over at her phone reading the time. Namjoon was going to be here soon, she wiped her face and ran into the bathroom. She was not going to think about Hoseok, matter of fact he was on punishment until she could figure something to say to him and what to do. In the shower she wrapped her arms around her body and thought about the kiss. If she hadn’t known better and was furiously trying to push the thought from her mind she might have enjoyed the kiss. His lips were soft, and the way he smelled, how he held her. No, she wasn’t like that. She had a man, a faithful one at that. Hoseok was a friend…nothing more.Drying off, she took her hair down applying edge control to some areas, brushing them gently into place. As she finished she picked up her phone and shot a quick text to Namjoon. Hey you usually call me around this timeShe watched the bubbles appear and disappear and then appear once more but no message ever popped up. Namjoon?I’m actually at the dorms right now…what do you want?Ok, thanks for being short? She thought, pretending to play dumb about him being home.Already? I thought you weren’t coming home until tomorrow?Don’t play dumb I know you know…you don’t need me…Hoseok was there wasn’t he?She sighed, why was he being such an ass? Ditching the texting she called him. No answer. Calling again, she tried to calm herself down.“What?” His voice came on the line.“Why are you being so rude? I missed you, you always come here after a trip. Why didn’t you come see me?”“You had Hoseok there didn’t you?” Her heart skipped a beat as the memory played in her head once more. He didn’t sound like he knew anything and she didn’t want to tell him right now.“I mean we hung out yea, and he was here today but he isn’t you. I want to see you.” She tried to sound sweet. “I made your favorite.” Namjoon sighed. “Let’s not play games. I saw you. I saw him. I saw his fucking hands on you.” Her breath caught in her throat creating an ache in her chest. “What?”He growled into the phone. “Don’t play with me, I ain’t said shit to him yet but I will.”“It wasn’t what it looked like.” Fingers gripping the phone. “I can explain, just come over and we can talk about it face to face.”She heard him scoff. “You actually think I want to see you right now? If I never see you again, it wouldn’t be soon enough.” Her lip quivered, tears stinging her eyes. “You don’t even know what happened! This is how I know! You didn’t see me slap him or push him away! Ask him yourself!”The line was silent, his heavy breathing through the speaker. She stayed quiet, hoping he’d say something, but he didn’t. “I’ll come to you.” Another heavy sigh. “I don’t want to see you.”“You don’t have a choice.” Hanging up the phone, she threw some clothes on and found a jacket. As she neared the front door she knelt down taking into her hand the crushed bouquet of white roses, he had come to see her and saw Hoseok kissing her instead.As she rode the train, she racked her brain on what to say. Would Hoseok be there? Would he lie? Would he tell the truth? God, what if the rest of the guys were there as well? She ran all the way to the dorms just as she reached the call box and saw Yoongi, Jin and V leaving. Their black masks on their faces, she saw the smiles behind them as they saw her. “Hey >>> my favorite person. Namjoon is back.” V said to her pulling her into a hug. “What’s wrong you look scared?”Trembling, she hugged V back and greeted the others. “Nothing, I’m fine, just cold. Is he still up there?”“In his room, must have had a bad flight back he looks pissed.” Jin said, wrapping a pink scarf around his neck. “Going to ‘comfort’ him?” Wagging his eyebrows as he said so. “Leave her alone, ya’ll will be alone, go on >>>.” Suga opened the door for her again, and the three walked off into the night. >>> licked her lips as she placed a hand on the doorknob to their shared apartment and opened the door. It smelled sweet and she noticed the sticky buns on the counter. Jin of course, no one else seemed to be here, Hoseok’s door was wide open. Namjoon’s was closed. taking her shoes off, she made long strides across the floor and down the hall to where his room was placing a hand on his doorknob, it was unlocked. He was leaning back on his bed in a dark room, the only light coming from the blue rope lights around his closet door. He had his phone in hand and earphones in his ears. “I told you no, you’re so damn hard-headed.” Swinging his legs off the bed to look at her; his silvery hair hanging above his eyes. “I told you I was coming anyway. How much did you see?” Wringing her hands together. Taking the plugs from his ears, Namjoon looked up at her. “Enough.”>>> swallowed hard. “I stopped fighting him because he was holding me so tight it hurt. I just stood there and let him finish, then I slapped him. Stung my hand I hit him so hard, he has to have a mark.” She tried to cross the room and come to him, but he held his hand up.“Namjoon. I’m not lying! Call him and ask him what happened. Tell him that you know. I told him to leave.” She felt panicky, she had done no wrong.“You know. I always knew he wanted you. I thought naw, not Hobi he’s not like that.” He looked at her, looking her body up and down. “Guess I was wrong.”“He’s a friend. Just my friend. He’s your friend too!” Flipping on the light switch as she spoke.“I thought he was.” Coming to a stand, Namjoon walked over to her, his hand on the door behind her he bent his face near hers. “Did you enjoy it? How he touched you? Was it something you thought about before us?”“No.” She lied, it wouldn’t do to tell the truth now. Not when it didn’t matter. She reached a hand out grasping at his shirt. “I love you. You know that.”He did. Inside he knew he did and for her to be acting like she was, Namjoon believed her. It still didn’t take away the hurt that he felt when he saw her with someone else. Take away the pain in his chest every time he closed his eyes and felt betrayal. Her fingers were so light on his shirt, her heart shaped face leaning up into his. Looking for something, anything. He let his fingers find her own and lead her back to his bed, sitting her down next to him. “I don’t deserve you. Trust me when i say I don’t. I know he can do better and I..I just thought about losing you. That maybe you finally saw that.” “You don’t get to tell me what I want. Especially when I know it’s you.” She watched his thumb smooth over her brown skin.Turning her face towards his, Namjoon let his lips rub over hers banishing the thought of anothers. “You were preparing something for me?” She hummed sweetly, speaking against his mouth. “At my place yes.” “Give it to me now.” Nipping her bottom lip as he spoke. Slipping her jacket off, she wrapped her arms around his neck as they fell backwards on the bed. His hands on her waist he worked his thumbs under the waist band of her joggers and pulled them down. Her hands under his shirt feeling the expanse of his chest. She missed him, she missed this. The way his warm skin stroked across her own, how he slowly undressed her, touched her. Her body was naked and under his by the time she was rubbing her thighs together eager for him to be between them. His mouth on the peaks of her breasts, tongue swirling around her nipples. She arched her back, legs falling open just as his hand slid down her chest, down her belly and between her legs. Bringing his mouth to her ear, he swirled his tongue around the edge. “This is mine right?” The electric spark that kicked up her spine, causing her to moan out loud just as his fingers slid down her moist slit. “All yours.” Hooking one arm under her knee he moved between her legs, tongue on her neck as he pushed himself into her opening. “Only mine?”Squeezing her eyes shut as he moved his hips back and forth slowly, he’d build her up before letting her fall. “Yes, please just…”“Just what?” Wrapping his arms around her body, encompassing her, >>> felt full of him. His weight, him deep within her pulling out slowly and sliding in hard.It was hard to think when he did that. Biting on her shoulder as he pistoned away. “You’re making me…” Breath catching as he let go of her leg so she could wrap them around him. Namjoon lifted his torso, holding her legs with him as he watched himself move in and out of her. He knew she was close, her hands on his waist as she arched her back and called his name. That’s what he wanted to hear, that’s what got him off, hearing her call his name. Knowing he was the one making her feel like she was flying. As they snuggled together and Namjoon whispered his love to her, Hoseok stood outside the door biting his bottom lip.It was never him. She went back to him, didn’t he make her feel anything? He wanted nothing more than to be where Namjoon was now.A few days later, she found herself at the dorms in the kitchen with Jin waiting for Namjoon to come back from the studio. She hadn’t spoken to Hoseok since the incident, not even a text and as far as she knew Namjoon hadn’t spoken to him either. “It’s a bit awkward don’t you think?” Jin asked her spooning cupcake batter into their holders. “What is?” She was licking a spoon he’d given her, but she knew what Jin was referring to. “Hoseok and Namjoon. I don’t blame them you’re beautiful but…I’m not going to sugarcoat this…together we…they don’t need to be-”Suga interrupted them standing in the doorway. “Fighting over you and hurting the group.” “Yoongi!” Jin slammed the bowl down. “Tact.” Suga shrugged sitting down at the island, taking the bowl. “You said you weren’t going to sugarcoat it.” He dipped his finger in the bowl, taking a glob of batter into his mouth. “Talk to Hoseok, tell him you’re with Namjoon and that’s it. Just talk to him, he’ll get over it and you want to stay friends. Or switch sides, or leave them both alone.” Jin sighed, putting his cupcakes into the oven. “Cold bastard.” Closing it he stood up and looked at her. “Listen, we all know how Hoseok feels and I was rooting for him when he first met you, but he didn’t make a move. He lost.”Yoongi grunted. “More like Namjoon cheated.” She looked back and forth between the men. “Wait, wait what?”Out of the corner of her eye she watched Jin grit his teeth at Yoongi. Slamming her hands down on the table, she turned to Jin. “Ok! Enough! Tell me what’s going on.” Taking off his apron, Jin sighed. “I am not getting into this, and you’ll be the one to answer. I’m done.” He set a timer before leaving the kitchen. Suga continued eating batter, not looking at her. The silence in the kitchen made her rub her hands together in nervousness. “Yoongi, tell me.” Rolling his eyes, the pink haired rapper turned his eyes on her. “Hoseok wanted you, Namjoon knew that and he stole you from under Hoseok’s nose. He romanced you like he knew Hoseok was too afraid to, by the time you were moaning under Namjoon, Hoseok was trying to figure out where he went wrong. It’s not a puzzle. It’s easy to see.” Getting up he placed the bowl in the sink. “Look, I’m not saying you’re a prize or that Namjoon doesn’t love you, but he likes to compete.” He walked from the kitchen stopping at the door to turn and look back her. “Choose one or none. I’m tired of the miasma around here.” As he left the kitchen she sat there looking down at the wood of the counter. She tried to think back to the time she first met Namjoon, had she noticed anything? Had she not seen something? Just as she was about to go sit in Namjoon’s room, she heard the front door open. Rushing out into the living room, she almost ran right into Hoseok. He stared at her unblinking as he shifted the bag on his back. His mouth open and closed, eyes darting anywhere but her face. “Hey.”“Hey.” Voice cracking as she cleared her throat. “We should talk.” Hoseok’s face went from a blank canvas to anger. “Haven’t talked to me in this long, why now?” Pushing past her he walked to his room.“Hobi wait.” Chasing after him, he turned around to face her.“Hobi what? Don’t call me that. Get out of my face >>>, go wait in Namjoon’s room so he can give you what you want.” He spat the last few words at her, turning again walking towards his room. This wasn’t like him, where was happy, sunny always smiling Hobi? The one who never let a pessimistic situation interrupt his mood? She followed him, opening the door as he tried to close it. “Stop, Hobi please. We need to talk.” He threw his bag on his bed, sighing as he sat down. “Sit. Talk. Like it’ll help.” His mouth contorted into a frown. Sitting down next to him on the bed felt strange, she looked at his hands gripping the blanket, how white his knuckles were. The veins in his arms as he strained, his face pointed away from her and looking towards the opposite wall. She reached her fingers toward his hand, touching his skin. He didn’t move. “Hoseok. We are friends. I love you, but not like I love him. The kiss was an accident. I’m begging you, for our sake and your group let’s just move past this. If you want we can start over and pretend-”“Pretend what?” He whispered. “Pretend like it never happened, like for one moment I didn’t feel that you wanted it? He’s not good enough for you, never was. I should have…I should have just.”“Told me how you felt before he ‘stole’ me from you?” She said quietly.Hoseok looked down at her, her fingers still on his knuckles, he let go of the blanket and turned his hand to rub over her fingers. “Exactly. Think about it >>> and believe me when I tell you if you left him he’d be over it in a week.” She snatched her fingers from him, eyes searching his face. “So now you’re trying to hurt me?” “Ask him what happened in Manila a year and half ago. Ask him what happened the whole time we were there.” Hoseok stood up walking over to his door. “Why don’t you tell me? Since you know so much, you tell me. You’re supposed to be my friend right? You’re also his friend so you see how this works out? You’re pitting us against each other, you are! We aren’t! Hoseok please, I’m begging you-”Hoseok laughed, a whooping sound that turned into a deep belly laugh. “Begging? No you aren’t. You want me to make you feel better, that’s all! Do you know how I’ve been feeling this whole time!” He walked towards her crowding >>> against the wall. “How I’ve felt about you and been ignored?! Watch you keep your eyes on him! It’s never been me! Do you know how that feels?!” He reached a hand up to wipe away a tear. Reaching a hand out >>> tried to touch him, but he slapped her hand away. “Hobi.”“Get out >>>. Get the fuck out.” He’d had never cursed at her. Never yelled at her like that. Hand shaking she slide under his arm still on the wall, and walked to the door. She wanted to say something, anything that would make it ok, but what could she say? Opening the door, she heard V, Jimin and Namjoon at the front door. She didn’t feel like being here, not when he was like this. Not when she couldn’t say anything to help him. Closing the door behind her, she took a deep breath forcing a smile on her face, as she walked to the living room. The whole night felt numb. Out to eat and then back to her house, she sat on the couch where Namjoon was currently kissing up her neck trying to pull the blanket off her. Namjoon knew that and he stole you from under Hoseok’s nose… Ask him what happened when we were in Manila…She bit her lip as he slipped his hand under her shirt, rubbing his thumb over her breast. He said that out of anger didn’t he? The curiosity nibbled at her mind. “Jagiya, come on, what’s wrong, usually you’re already on me.” Namjoon’s husky voice in her ear. Her voice was shaky afraid of the answer as she opened her mouth to speak. “What happened in Manila?”He sat up looking at her face as she turned towards him. “What? When?”“A year and a half ago…we were dating then. What happened in Manila a year and a half ago?” Rolling his eyes, Namjoon sat back on the couch a small smile on his face. “We had a concert there then, that was fun. Why are you bringing this up?”Standing up, she pulled the blanket off her body tossing it on the couch. “Is that all that happened?” He always looked out the corner of his eye when something was happening he didn’t like. Like he was now. Getting up Namjoon folded the blanket, buckled his pants and started towards the door. >>> followed him grabbing his shoulder. “Namjoon! Answer me!” She knew. She knew what happened but she wanted to hear him say it. “Answer you and say what?! Who have you been talking to, that you’re questioning me?!”Tears welled in her eyes as punched at his shoulder. “Bastard! Just say it! Tell me!” Her cheeks wet, as she continued to pound on his shoulder. Grabbing her wrist, he spoke quietly. “I fucked someone, don’t remember her name or her face. She was eager, I was willing. That was it.” Attempting to snatch her arm back, >>> felt sick. He pretended like nothing happened. That was six months into their relationship, she remembered when he came back, they made love for the first time. “Did you know how Hoseok felt as well?” Wiping her face, she wrapped her arms around herself, trying to will the tears to stop. “What? Oh my god, fucking…I wanted you >>>, baby listen. That girl was nothing-.” He wrapped his arms around her, holding her back close to his chest. “If she was nothing, then why’d you do it? God, you came back and we…right now you were trying to.” She tried to pull away from him, but he held tight. “>>> stop, it’s in the past. I have no one but you, I swear it.” Rubbing his nose in her coily top knot.She stepped hard on his foot and pulled away. “Leave.”Scoffing, Namjoon crossed his arms over his chest. “So what? You want to leave me over some old shit? I felt bad! I was wrong! I know this, but that was the past we are happy we don’t need to dwell on that >>> listen to me…”Wiping her eyes, >>> fixed her face. “I don’t want to hear anything but the sound of that door closing as you leave. Walk now. How long was I supposed to live with a lie? How long did you know how your friend felt? Leave.” Raising an eyebrow Namjoon grinned at her, pulling on his jacket. “I’ll see you later, give you some time to cool off. It’s ok.” As he closed the door >>> wondered what she should do. What she could do, the only person she would have turned to wasn’t here. Would he even come to her now? Everything was crashing in around her, this feeling, this emptiness. Was he telling the truth? Was it only one time? She sat back on the couch, tears flowing again, she didn’t want to be alone, she couldn’t. Her phone flashed. An email, but her eyes landed on her background. A picture of her and Hoseok at a park….at least a year old. If she didn’t have a boyfriend that was fine, but she would always need a friend. Picking up her phone she covered her sniffles and dialed…It wasn’t late but Hobi was drained. His head hurt and all he wanted to do was sleep. His ringing phone in the back of his mind however made that hard and, he rolled over in bed taking a look at the screen. A picture of him and >>>His thumb hovered over the answer button, as he bit his bottom lip. He wanted to answer it, he wanted to hear her sing-song voice and hear her laugh. Then he remembered earlier, closing his eyes Hobi pressed reject and turned back over. Twice his phone rang, and he didn’t answer although guilt and worry ate at him. What if something was wrong? What if she needed help? He heard the front door slam and heard Namjoon talking to Jin. Apparently, he was upset, sitting up in the darkness of his room, his door was slightly ajar. He watched Namjoon and Jin near his door. “So, you’re just not going to settle this? Joon, come on this is stupid. He’s your friend, we all are. Talk to Hobi.” Jin whispered.“I’m not talking to him. He wants to be a baby about it instead of coming to me, you know he told her about Manila? What kind of friend is that?!” Namjoon glanced towards Hobi door, but couldn’t see him.Jin sighed. “You were wrong too, don’t you see that? Look, I’m tired of walking on eggshells around here-”“Jin. It’ll handle itself. I’m getting some shit and going to the studio.” He watched Jin cross his arms. “Alone?”“My business, hyung.” Namjoon entered his room closing the door behind him. Looking towards Hobi’s room, Jin hovered a hand over the door wanting to know but instead he walked away. Phone screen lighting up, Hobi looked down at it. A text, swiping his finger over the screen he opened it. I know you don’t want to talk to me, much less see me. I just need you…please HobiHe sighed. He always was a sucker for her. Walking up to her door, he knocked a few times waiting. She didn’t answer. Jiggling the handle, he watched as the door opened and took a step inside. “>>>…it’s me. Hoseok. You here?” No answer. He closed the door behind him and switched on the living room light. Still nothing. Walking back to her room he saw a light from the bathroom, and made his way over knocking on the door. “>>>…it’s me.” “Hobi.” Her voice was faint, he opened the door to see her in the tub, the water must have been cold by now as she sat shivering in the water with her knees pulled to her chest. “>>>, what the hell.” He grabbed a towel holding it open for her. “Get out, come on, you must be freezing.” He lifted her arms wrapping the towel around her, he tried to keep his eyes ahead and not on her body as she fell into his arms. Rubbing the cloth against her skin, Hobi lead her back to her room sitting her down on the bed. Her coiled hair was on her head in a messy bun. Breathing softly she leaned against him, her hair smelling of tea tree oil was right beneath his nose. Slowly, his arm came around her holding her waist, the opposite arm on her thigh, he leaned his head down to breathe in her scent. He didn’t want to feel like this, he didn’t want to still love her like he did. God, what she did to him, how his heart ached when he was near her. To see her so vulnerable like this. This was them, this was their space, their niche in which they fit so well together. “Thank you.” Her voice hoarse, she tried to clear her throat but a cough came out. “You probably caught a cold in there. Why’d you do that?” He asked, feeling his body melt when she touched his hand and their fingers intertwined. “I don’t know. I wanted to feel numb, and you didn’t answer. I didn’t know who else to turn to. He said…you were right. I feel so stupid. I feel used. I don’t know.” She snuggled her head into his chest. He rubbed her arm, moving her away slowly to stand up. “You need to get dressed, let me make some tea ok?”She nodded her head standing up with the towel around her, walking to her closet, she closed the door slightly. Hobi stood at the door to her room, hands on the frame as he watched the towel fall down her body. The glimpses he got could get him through the night, but he didn’t know how he could leave without telling her he was the one for her. As >>> came into the kitchen she sat at the island watching Hobi pour some tea into cups. “You know Jackson Wang of Got7 swears by organic green tea, but, I feel peppermint is the better cure all.” He set a cup down in front of her, grinning. “You didn’t have to come Hoseok, I know that, and if it’s too painful for you to be here-”Hoseok cut her off. “It’s not. Truth be told I am angry at you but I wanted to see you. You know I’m always willing to see you.”“No matter what I do huh? No matter what decisions I make?” She couldn’t look him in the eye, she couldn’t stare at his face and watch him go through these confusing emotions. Sitting down next to her, Hobi turned his chair to face hers. “I know how I feel, you know how I feel. I can’t pressure you, I can only hope that maybe you’ll do what pleases the both of us. I know that sounds selfish but, with you-” Crawling his fingers over to where hers where, he clasped hers tightly. “I can’t help but to be selfish creature concerning you.” >>> looked up and into Hobi’s face. His now cinnamon brown hair and almond eyes. His wider near the bottom nose and strong jaw. He was beyond handsome and she’d always known that. Hell, she’d always been attracted to him. He was her type, he was the type of guy she’d fall for in an instant. How did all this end up how it was? Namjoon was charismatic, he was intelligent and witty. Not to say that Hobi wasn’t but Namjoon knew how to talk you into something and make you think the idea was yours. Licking her lips, she watched a grin break out over his face. Their fingers intertwined, they both leaned forward and kissed. It was slow and steady, a few pecks here and there and then hands on faces and Hobi pulling her off her chair and into his lap. Her legs straddling his, her pajama shorts riding up her ass, he gripped it tight and nibbled on her bottom lip before his tongue delved into her mouth. He was tasting her, and she was allowing it, hands in his hair she moaned into his mouth, body grinding against his. He couldn’t believe this was happening, finally, she was sharing what he always wanted with them and then, she was gone. Off his lap and on the couch, hands covering her face she was crying again. Hobi missed the warmth, the tent in his pants obviously needing more contact he sat next to her rubbing his back. “It’s ok, I got caught up in the moment.” She wouldn’t want him, he was trying to figure out how to accept that. “No, stop. I want you, I do but I’m still with him and I can’t just…god why is this so hard?” She nearly yelled, slamming her hands on her knees. “It doesn’t have to be! I told you after a week he’ll be fine. >>> please-”“Shut up.” She said, eyes wet as she looked up at him. Hobi raised an eyebrow. “What?” “You want me don’t you? You want me under you, you want my body. Maybe after you have it the appeal will wear off. Maybe that’s it.” She stood up, looking down at Hobi still kneeling on the floor. He crawled closer to her, wrapping his arms around her waist as he spoke into her stomach. “Even if I didn’t get that, nothing could keep me from you, no matter how much it hurts to see you with him.” Her fingers raking through his hair, she felt a flame race down her spine and through her pelvis. She wanted him, and she would have him, if only for tonight. Hobi peeled the shorts down her legs, not stunned at all when he saw she wasn’t wearing panties. His hand going down her taut stomach, he dipped his face near her belly button and kissed around it. Her hands on his, he shivered in anticipation, kissing her thighs going lower as she placed her legs on his shoulders. How long had he dreamed about delving his tongue into her moist cavern? His lips on her slit, he kissed her poking his tongue out gently to touch her. She moaned, pressing her body closer to his face. Using two fingers Hobi opened her petals, finding the treasure he was searching for his tongue caressing it, rolling around and around until she was moaning his name, grabbing his hair. Her feet on his shoulders, she very nearly rode his face as his teeth grazed her adding spice to this blissful feeling. As she came wetting his face with her juices, he licked his lips kicking his pants off in a hurry as he hovered his body over hers.Their lips in a careful dance, he placed a hand on her hip steadying her body. “I want to so bad, but if you don’t want me…” Letting his words trail off. God he prayed she didn’t want to stop. His length pressing against her thigh and rubbing against her, already coated in her wetness.  She said nothing hands on his face, her legs up around his waist she pulled him in, groaning as he penetrated her. Their eyes open and on each other, Hobi rocked his hips seating himself fully inside her. This was it, his heart was beating a mile a minute, body unable to be controlled he pressed his forehead to hers and listened to her pleading moans as they made love. She was sound asleep but Hoseok was awake heart still racing as he laid in bed next to her and thought about what just happened. How he was inside her, how she begged for more. They kissed, god more than kissing he was tasting her, gathering a bit of her soul into him as he shared his. He had always wanted this, waited on this. Namjoon. They were still together right? Maybe. He didn’t know and honestly he didn’t care, still twitching as he thought about it. They made love twice, and he was willing to go a third, but he let her sleep. Reaching over he trailed his fingers down her spine, watching as she shivered and then pulled her blankets up on her more. Hobi turned over on his side and snuggled into her back, calming once she put her leg over his and settled into sleep once more. The next morning was nothing different, she acted the same and truth be told it was like nothing ever happened between them. As she made breakfast he sat the island talking about what had happened lately. As she set a plate down in front of him, Hoseok grabbed her hand pulling her towards him. “We should talk about last night.” He pressed his lips against hers gently.>>> didn’t know how to feel, she kissed him back but knowing what she did made her stomach turn. She was no better than Namjoon, and with his friend, his member. She cleared her throat and took a step back sitting down next to Hoseok with her own plate. “What do you want me to say?” She asked, pouring syrup over her pancakes. Hobi raised an eyebrow, she wouldn’t meet his eyes now. Why? “That it was good, that you want to be with me. You’ll call it off with Namjoon and I can stop living this nightmare.” “Hobi- I-” She started. “I mean, we made love. More than once. Again this morning! You’re making me feel like…kinda unwanted right now.” He pushed at his eggs. >>> sighed, she wasn’t trying to. Honestly she wasn’t it was just…difficult. “I’m processing a lot right now. If I didn’t want to-I wouldn’t have. That simple Hobi…I just don’t know how I can face him.”“I’ll be with you if you want me too.” A glimmer of hope as he smiled at her. “Like that will make it better, god it’ll seem like I planned this.” She took a sip of her juice. “I don’t know what I want to do.” Hoseok got quiet, whispering now. “So you want to stay with him even though you know what he did? Stay with him and I guess when you’re upset I come over and make it better right?”>>> clenched her jaw in annoyance. “No, that is not what I’m saying. God, Hobi don’t make this hard. We had sex. We fucked. Namjoon’s girlfriend and his best friend, don’t you realize how that sounds? How it makes me look?” “Like you had a choice! Like you knew that it’s over between you guys and you chose me. Chose me. I’m asking you now, why is it so hard?” He pushed his plate away, staring at her. “Did you not hear what I just said?! You guys are apart of the same group, Jesus who is next? V? He’s overly nice to me sometimes.”“Taehyung had a crush on you but that’s over. It’s also not the point. Me or him, choose. I’m not going to keep running over here when he makes you cry. I’m not going to be the one to make it better, and watch you run back to him. I refuse, I won’t do it.” She stood up, throwing her hands in the air. “Then don’t! I’m not asking you too!” “That’s not what you said last night, and I have the texts to prove it.” Crossing his arms over his chest.She shook her head, turning her back on him. “That’s low…so what? Going to use that against me? Are you going to act like you weren’t the eager one to get into my pants?”“Oh fuck that.” Hobi stood up pacing now. “Like your legs weren’t on me, pulling me in, like you weren’t begging me the second time- I’m not going to ask you again! Me or him, and I won’t-”He stopped, looking up at the door, >>> turned around to see Namjoon standing there leaning against the door. “No, go on.” She covered her mouth, fingers trembling as she looked at Namjoon. Hobi stared him in the face, body going lax as he watched Namajoon come inside and sit down on the couch. “I come all the way over here to see you, and I hear people yelling outside the door. Who could that be? I say to myself. Sounds like Hoseok and >>>, why are they arguing like a married couple? So I come inside and wow…I hope my ears have deceived me.” He sat back on the couch, arms over the back as he looked from Hoseok to >>>. She said nothing still too afraid to move as Hoseok moved from where he was back to the island to sit down facing Namjoon. “So you know now, you heard everything.” Namjoon smiled. “Every. Damn. Thing.” Turning towards >>> he smiled at her, why was he smiling like that? “Did you go that thing with your tongue and your hand and sweep it over him?” He looked at Hoseok as he said his next words. “Makes me come every time, I like to watch her lick it up.” “Stop it.” She said, covering her face. “Shut up Namjoon.”“No, no I honestly want to know. Did she scratch her nails down your back and tell you harder right as she orgasms?” He looked into her eyes. “Shut up!” She screamed throwing a dish rag at him that was near her, it fell short falling in front of him.Grunting Namjoon said nothing for awhile, the silence in the room palpable. After awhile he sighed, speaking. “So what’s going to happen now Hoseok. You want her to leave me, so you can be with her. Apparently, I’m the bad guy.” Namjoon stood up walking towards Hoseok. “I’m the bad guy, but here you are behind my back, fucking my girl.” Hoseok pushed Namjoon, getting into his face. “Like you didn’t mess around on her?” Namjoon pushed him back. “Like what you did makes it any better! That’s MY girl, I don’t care what you think. You’re my friend!” The men grabbed each others shirts, as >>> ran in between them. “Stop it! Stop it now!” Namjoon slapped her hand away. “And you. You’re just a slut.” She was about to retaliate when Hoseok went for him again, trying to hold the men apart screaming at them. Namjoon pushed her towards Hobi. “Whatever, have fun…I’m leaving.” As >>> was about to run after Namjoon, Hoseok grabbed her arm. “What are you doing?” “I have to go to him, Hoseok. He-just trust me I have to.” She tried to pull from Hobi, pleading with him. “Please.” Hobi closed his eyes, grinding his teeth as he looked at her. “If I let you go, how do I know you’ll come back?”Her eyes watered as she looked at the door and then back at Hoseok, she felt her hand slip loose from his grip and when she was free she ran after Namjoon. Alone in the apartment, Hoseok felt his chest cave in, the heat rising to his cheeks as he blinked back his tears and punched a wall; letting loose a scream. “Namjoon! Namjoon please slow down.” She finally caught up to him near a bus stop grabbing onto his arm. “Get off me >>>, go back in there with Hoseok that’s where you wanna be right?” He got in her face, his mouth so close to hers. “That’s what you want?” “I never said that.” It hurt her to even utter the words. So why had she? Pushing her away, Namjoon covered his face and began to laugh. He laughed until he started to cry tears coming down his cheeks he turned away from her sitting down a wooden bench near some trees. She said nothing, watching him as he wiped his face with the back of his hand. He didn’t look at her, not even in her direction. He simply sighed, shoving his hands into his pockets. It was then that she approached him, sitting down away from him on the bench. She watched the wind ruffle his hair, his thick lips as he bit the bottom one. “I never meant to hurt you Joon. I didn’t want this to end up this way.” She inched her fingers across the space between them touching the sleeve of his jacket. “You never meant to hurt me. He repeated. “Why does it seem like it’s a lie? You’ve been in love with him, I knew it but I didn’t care because instead of giving it to him you gave it to me.” “That’s not true!” She shouted back. “Stop it >>>. Let’s just stop.” Sighing, he let his head lead back, his throat exposed, he swallowed hard. “I knew how he felt. I knew he’d never make a move unless you did so I made the first one.” She shivered as the wind began to blow, wrapping her arms around herself as she listened. “So you lied.” Namjoon scoffed. “Let’s not get into pointing fingers, you’re hardly in a place to do so.” He was right, and she sat back against the cold wood. “At first it was a joke. I wanted o pressure him into asking you, get him to confess but we went on a date and…I liked you. I never took the time to really see you and when I did I became obsessed over what I saw.” Swallowing hard Namjoon continues. “We started dating and Hoseok he…he came to me and asked me why. At first, I thought he’s just jealous but when I saw the hurt in his eyes I knew it was real, by that time I was falling for you and you for me and I couldn’t let go. That was a shitty thing to do and I was wrong. As for Manila…I think that was me trying to make you leave. I kept telling myself that I’d tell you and we’d be done. You’d be with Hobi, everything would work out. It didn’t play like that though, I got home and when I saw your face-I couldn’t.” Turning towards her, Namjoon took off his jacket and placed it around her shoulders. He pulled her close to him, moving her coils from near her eyes before rubbing her shoulders. He said nothing, studying the angles and planes of her face and he wondered if she felt truly happy with him. Would he be content as he was before to let her go? Could he let her go and not look back? “Joon.” He silenced her by kissing her. His lips lingering on hers. No, he couldn’t let go that easily, she was apart of him now and how he ached to have her. Even though she was with him, even though he knew and did what he did. He’d choose her again and again. Why? His fingers on her face, >>> turned her cheek into his palm. “I’m sorry. I don’t know what to do and I don’t know what to say, I just. How I feel is so…”“Conflicting.” He knew the emotion. He knew it too well. “You love me and you love him, but who do you love more?” She couldn’t answer that question. She couldn’t be the one to break either of their hearts. How could she live with herself like this? “I…I can’t-”Cutting her off Namjoon smiled. “That’s what I thought. Go home >>>, go home and think. Weigh the pros and cons and decide who you want because I won’t do this. I won’t be with you and know that you pine for him. I won’t watch him wither away because the one person he wants hasn’t made up her mind about how she feels for him. I don’t like indecision, you know that.” Standing her up, Namjoon rose with her and hailed a cab. They stood in silence as the black vehicle drove up. Namjoon held her hand in his own and briefly wondered if this would be the last time he would do so. “Go home and think give it a day, I’ll be in the studio for awhile. When you know what you want, come see me.”“I can’t do this, Joon please.” She pleaded, holding onto his arm as he pulled away from her. “Yes you can. I won’t hold it against you, I just want you to choose. If you pick me we go on like it never happened but you can’t be alone with him ever again. You can’t go back to that friendship. I’ll settle things with Hoseok but no more. If you choose him.” He took a deep breath. “I’ll understand, and it’ll hurt but I will live.” Getting into the taxi, he rolled the window down looking at her, saying nothing. The car started to pull away and when it turned around going down the street, she watched as he raised a hand to his lips and then to her. Back at home, Hoseok had cleaned up his mess but he paced in the living room wondering where they were and what she was doing. As >>> came into the door, he panicked and rushed to her grabbing her face in his hand. “>>>, you came back.” She touched his hands, shrugging out of Namjoon’s coat as she looked at Hoseok. “Of course I did. Where else would I go?” Watching the smile fade from Hobi’s lips. “With him.” He held her hand as they walked to the couch, sitting down next to her, he pulled her into his embrace. Namjoon’s smell was on her, he’d know that cologne anywhere. Grinding his teeth he pushed it away, and rubbed his nose into her hair. “Say something.” “He told me to think on it. He told me to take a day and weigh the pros and cons and he explained himself.” She sniffled, wiping a tear away as she looked at Hoseok. “He’s right.”“What do you mean?” Worry creeping into Hoseok’s voice as he wondered what she was thinking. He could be as eloquent as Namjoon but what exactly had he said to her? Would he lose her? Would he also lose a friend in a process?“I should do what he said and take some time and think about who I’m going to be with. Hoseok, he said that if I choose him we cannot be friends as we are now, how close we are. You don’t want me to be around him like that if I choose you, right?” “True. I understand you had a relationship but…this is difficult.” Hoseok looked down at his hands and realized they were shaking. “So you want me to leave?” “I want you to leave for now. I need to think. I need to really know what’s going on this has gone far enough don’t you think?” She stood up, taking a deep breath. “I just…if I lose you. I lose some of me too.” Hoseok said coming to a stand. “I’ve had you for a night and I can’t get enough, but if it’ll make you happy, what else am I to do? I’ll respect your decision.” He grabbed his own coat heading for the door. Hand on the wood he looked back at her one time smiling. >>> stared at him wondering how she would feel if the shoe were on the other foot. This whole time she had acted selfishly and she was reaping the repercussions of her decisions. As Hoseok closed the door, she heard him whisper that he loved her, the sound of the door shutting making her heart ache. What would she do now? Who would she choose? Cleaning up her house >>> washed her blankets and sheets, hoping to take a nap and not be riddled with the smell of Hoseok. In her mind, it sounded mean but she knew she was going to lean to him. Remember him, and start her emotional roller coaster all over again the moment Namjoon came into her mind. She laid down on her bed and pulled a pillow close to her taking a deep breath. She loved Namjoon, he was intelligent, witty, could be sarcastic but profoundly philosophical at the same time. He had a way of showing her he loved that, that was subtle. It was in the way he did things, asked her if she ate, wondered where she was, and checked the weather and reminded her to grab a jacket. He was sweet in his love-making, taking his time as he made her reach her peak. Hoseok was different, he was funny and caring. Thoughtful and sympathetic. He cared by doing, and he always showed that. In every effort he made sure those he loved were cared for. He had no problem holding hands and kissing. He didn’t care who was looking. She sniffled, wiping her nose she was supposed to be with Namjoon; but in her heart she desired Hobi, she always did. They would be waiting for her in two different places, where was she supposed to go? A day later, >>> awoke and dressed for the day. A black off shoulder sweater dress, she matched it with a pair of red suede boots. Styling her coily hair into a twisted pompadour. She took a deep breath and walked out the door heading to the train station. >>> wrung her hands as she closed her eyes and wondered what exactly she should say when she got there. I thought long and hard, and this is where I wanna beNo that wouldn’t do.I love you.Overused. If you’ll have me…Forget it. She’d wing it when she got there. Getting off of her stop, she stepped into the cold air, completely forgetting she’d need a jacket. Arms rubbing at her shoulders she continued to walk to the building, hoping that when she reached the door he hadn’t changed his mind. That he wouldn’t turn her away, where would she go then? She would be alone and realizing this game she played turned on her in the end. The studio or the dorms. Either way she was making a decision that she slept on and spent all day thinking about. Standing in front of the door, her heart raced and thumped inside her chest as she danced around on her feet, taking some time before he knocked on the door. Her hand raised in a fist she knocked gently, then once more with confidence as she heard him cry out, the shuffling near the door he unlocked it. Namjoon in the studio, she thought about how he slept on that impossibly small cot in there. Hoseok in the dorms she knew he probably had Jin breathing down his back asking him what was going on. As the door opened she was greeted by a stern jaw, though the smirk on the lips told her he was happy to see her. He opened the door, leaning his head against the frame. “So you came. I was worried you wouldn’t. I was scared in fact.” “You said that you’d learn to get on without me, that you’d respect my decision.” She answered, looking down at the ground and then back at him, his dark eyes studying her body. He opened the door fully, strong arms crossing over his chest. “Got dressed up too, I feel like it’s birthday.”She grinned, hiding her smile behind her hand. “Are you going to let me in or not?” “I don’t know.” Tapping his finger against his lip. I’ve been waiting for you.” Wrapping her arms around Hoseok’s neck she gently kissed his lips. “And you won’t have to wait anymore.” I know! I know! I left it ambiguous till the end! Don’t hurt me! LOL I LOVE THIS SO MUC I SCREAMED THE WHOLE TIME KJFJCHJH" False text

Because your favorite writer only writes about a pale skinned , long haired short girl and its HONESTLY ANNOYING! PLEASE END THAT SHIT. Your an asshole IDC, you only appeal to the one color , one look. If your gonna write a freaking smut/scenario appeal to everyone, and not just your self. BC. Woc dont need this discrimination, Even in our own little world. If you won’t. Then keep your stories to your self, or better yet tag it “pale skin only” or “girls with long straight hair, nice body, nice this and that, pale skin, talks like this & does this” might as well name the girl since its clearly you your talking about. Its not hard to be diverse. Its just ugly that I’m still seeing this separation , and having to find stories or tls like “Hispanic section” “black section” and white. Segregation even In a world where we all one fan base its purely stupid. And even for guys. There’s barely anything for fanboys to read BC its always girls but its mostly girls so I get it. But anyway, stop writing y/n as if we are all the same race when you explain the girl. You make people feel bad about themselves even more and if that wasn’t your intention, and your gonna say something bitchy like “don’t read them then” then that explains you as a person and your a sad ass person and you need to be sent back to 1940 where you belong.(there are a few good writers that appeal to everyone that needs more recognition too.)"

Some cuddling and kisses. Kisses and cuddling?” I asked smiling kissing his nose“That and pillow talk” He said and I raised an eyebrow“Pillow talk babe, really. Pillow talk is what happens after sex silly” I said“Well not necessarily. It doesn’t always have to be sexual you perv”“Do you want to make it sexual?” he asked“Taehyung I’m going to bed” I said turning away from him“No don’t! I’m sorry.” he wrapped his arm around my waist“Talk to me” he said“About what?” I asked“Talk to me about your family in America” He kissed my cheek pulling me closer“Well i talked to my mom the other day and she said she misses me as usual. My dad got a new job, my brother is still in college. Everything is still generally the same” I shrugged“They haven’t had to, you know. Deal with those bad policemen have they?” he asked and I chuckled shaking my head“If they did then i wouldn’t be here right now. I’d be in America probably protesting in the street” I said turning to face him“Baby protesting can be dangerous and scary” He said“Not if it’s a peaceful one” I said kissing his jaw“Peaceful protest can also be dangerous too. I don’t know what I would do if something like that ever happened to you.” he mumbled rubbing my back“Well lucky for you I won’t be going protesting for a while”“A while, what does that mean?” he asked“When I go to see my mom in September her and I are going to go and march in the streets” I said“Can I go with you?” he asked“Baby are you sure that’s what you want to do?” I asked“I’d be honored too” he said as he begin to yawnI kissed him and laid my head on his shoulder closing my eyes.“Goodnight baby girl”“Goodnight baby boy”I wanna go marching but am also afraid to get hurt."

He only stayed around her, and I think that she got comfortable with him too. And he’s cute, friendly and sweet so it’s hard not to like jimin. Examples: good thing jimin was waiting for her to come sit down with him sadly Victoria is left out  jimin’s arm around her  he likes the twins, a lot.  his arm is still around her  checking out the goods and the body this time  checking out the boobs again  he literally pulled her attention away from Rapmon, by taking her hand.  christina comes to sit with jimin again  christina’s arm around jimin  why is he sitting on Jewel’s chair, but he’s only talking to Christina…?  my conclusion: jimin and christina have chemistry. and its cute how he kept his eyes on her, and only seemed to stick around her. Rapmon is another case, he liked all three girls. He flirted talked to all of them.  Bewbs" False link
