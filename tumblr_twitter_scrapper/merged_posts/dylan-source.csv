Roger Yuan: I just finished fight-training Dylan O’Brien, the young actor from The Maze Runner. The project is called American Assassin, and it’s based on the Vince Flynn books. It’s fantastic. Dylan actually went through a horrific accident where, basically, he had to reconstruct his face. I had to train him physically, but I also had to help guide him, almost like a counselor, in terms of the emotional and psychological aspects of what he had gone through — to not be victimized by the accident, but use it as a tool to work through and get stronger for the future. I’ve been very, very fortunate. I’ve been able to work with Daniel Craig on Skyfall and Matt Damon on Jason Bourne, so to start a young man off in the process — to start Dylan O’Brien off as Mitch Rapp — I feel very blessed, and hopefully, it bears out that what happened was meant to be.

The production had shut down after O’Brien was sidelined when he was seriously injured on the set in March while filming the third installment of the popular YA franchise and was hospitalized with injuries to his face. The production was supposed to start up on May 9, but that was postponed as was the release date to give more time for O’Brien to convalesce. Fox had pushed the film’s release date from Feb. 17, 2017 to Jan. 12, 2018. O’Brien was said to have fallen off a set that was made to look like the back of a train and fractured either his cheekbone or orbital socket. The crew went their separate ways after the second postponement, but now schedules have been worked out to move forward early next year, albeit in a new location. The Maze Runner: The Death Cure will still be directed by Wes Ball. The script by T.S. Nowlin was adapted from one of the series of the popular books by James Dashner. Wyck Godfrey, Ellen Goldsmith-Vein and Lee Stollman are the producers. Read Article" True text

Everything’s laid out on the table, there’s nothing hiding between the two of them and that really creates a really solid bond or brings back the bond that they used to have.” Posey continues, “They’re in the same frame of mind that they were in in the first season, but they’ve gone through all of this stuff together, so they’re way more mature and wiser and more comfortable with each other, so you just see the love between Stiles and Scott grow even more and fans are going to fall in love with that.

I hadn’t actually done that before, but I didn’t want to do it as it was written. By the way, this wasn’t just me, it was everyone involved: we didn’t think it was there yet.”His character, Stan Hurley, is a mentor to the young assassin, played by The Maze Runner star Dylan O’Brien. Although this type of character was new for him, Keaton was up to the challenge for one very significant reason: “I’m going to be really honest—this [movie] has potential for international appeal.

This does not mean all the work is done on the first half of Season 6. With a number of scenes yet to be filmed, Davis says they’ll be back, “We’re picking back up again to do two more weeks of shooting in August.” Teen Wolf can generally shoot a single episode in about 7 working days. By working more than one unit at a time, they can do one episode and a bit more in the same period of time. If they’re coming back for a full two weeks, that suggests they’ve got a great deal still to do. Davis still won’t comment on Dylan O'Brien’s current condition or participation in Season 6 except to repeat what he’s told us before. Dylan will be on the show for Season 6. While some may speculate that returning to do what amounts to two more episodes later this summer has something to do with Dylan’s injury but that is pure speculation and cannot be confirmed.

I’ve only recently discovered this place. Last year I was an extra during the London filming of American Assassin and I got to ‘act’ (because extras don’t really) with Dylan. A couple of times I was about a couple of feet away; I was coolly professional of course since we were both working! It was freezing cold but we had to pretend it was summer in Turkey. They changed the street signs over and everything. I didn’t recognise Dylan at first. He was very slender and he looked much the same as he does in the photos; I say this because sometimes actors look different. I did sneak a look or two and was happy to see he looked fine. All through the filming he was cheerful and upbeat. I saw him joking with the crew. However, when required, he got down to work and was very professional. We asked one of the production assistants what he was like and she said he was lovely. He seemed to get on with everyone on set and, because I always watch for these things, it was everyone; male, female, younger, older.  He also talked to us, the extras! I’ve heard so many stories of stars feeling too high and mighty to associate with extras. There were some child extras on set and he tried to make them laugh. He also chatted with extras just standing near waiting for the shoot to start. There was one really buff guy extra in a tee-shirt and Dylan pretended to bow down and worship his buffness and people smiled. So yeah, positive impression of Dylan. Everyone on the set was really nice and the directors personally thanked us all for our hard work when we finished. I redacted just a tad, but thank you so much for sharing this experience with us!  I’m so happy to hear how lovely he was and if you have any more stories please let us know!  Thanks again!
