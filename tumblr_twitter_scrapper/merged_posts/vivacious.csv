Typical traits include the following: 1. As students, they work differently from other people. They often pick up on subtleties and may think deeply about a subject before sharing in a discussion or contributing in a classroom setting. (This does not necessarily mean they don’t understand the material, or are too shy to speak in public. It has more to do with the way the person processes information.) 2. They tend to be highly conscientious in their work. They notice and pay attention to details, and they think things through very carefully. Also, often being highly sensitive is equated with higher levels of intelligence, being highly intuitive and having a vivid imagination. Highly sensitive individuals work and learn best in quiet and calm environments. 3. Highly sensitive students and employees generally underperform when they are being evaluated. They are highly conscious of being watched, and this inhibits their ability to function at their peak. 4. Although some individuals who are born with this trait may seem to be more introverted by nature, being introverted and highly sensitive do not always go together. Instead, environmental factors have a greater influence on how the individual feels and reacts. 5. People with high sensitivity are more sensitive to both negative and positive experiences. Thus, they are more affected by rough treatment, pain, heartaches and insensitivity from others … but also seem to benefit more from being treated with kindness, care and thoughtfulness. 6. Other common characteristics of the highly sensitive person being easily over-stimulated (hence the need for quiet and calm), being more emotionally reactive than others, and having higher levels of empathy.    " False text

Intended for women with purse-bound phones, MEMI allows women to actually unplug while staying connected to the people that matter most. According to creator Leslie Pierson, MEMI isn’t trying to get women more plugged into their phones but instead, help them focus more on moments they care about while stripping away distraction. It’s about unplugging, just enough, while still having peace of mind that those who need you can still get through. It’s exactly what makes MEMI special and a shining example of a wearables company doing things right. While tech companies often create beautiful and interesting products, they far too often gloss over why it’s important to consumers and how it will actually fit into a person’s life. This is especially prevalent when designing for women. If a tech company doesn’t understand how a product fits into a woman’s life, the product is probably not going to resonate with them. MEMI is one of the first wearables to really understand women’s needs and wants. Recognizing many women wear jewelry rather than “devices,” MEMI created something that puts equal emphasis on function and fashion, and, most importantly, adds real value to their lives. MEMI recently knocked it out of the park with a successful Kickstarter campaign and is expected to formally hit the market in August. Another wearables for women that we love?

vivacious 51561473592 "2013-05-28 14:49:15 GMT" https://vivacious.tumblr.com/post/51561473592 " For brands that operate solely online, namely fashion retail e-commerce websites, it is important for them to employ a strong sense of branding and a stellar user experience in order to differentiate from the masses. Since the online marketplace is heavily saturated with products, each desperately vying for online customers, it is easy to get lost and confused in the midst of looking for the right product and website to shop at.  Companies such as Fab and Everlane are great examples of online e-commerce websites that have found great success, traction, and customer loyalty. What all of these online brands have in common is their user-centric focus, a strong understanding of their target audience, and simplicity in navigation that results in a delightful experience.   Fab Let’s start with analyzing Fab, one of the fastest growing e-commerce retail sites based in New York. In February 2013, Fab has reached a staggering number of 11 million users, a major jump from 175,000 members at the time of their launch in June 2011.  What attributed to their success? Fab CEO, Jason Goldberg, wrote in his personal blog (betashop.com) about his ideas for the creation of Fab. He noted that there was a lack of a “web-native e-commerce brand today for design products, particularly at discount pricing.” Goldberg understood that there was a niche market for this need and set out to execute his vision. Fab delivered an exceptional user experience that contrasts with the typical online shopping experience that Goldberg referred to as “uninspiring and overwhelming”.  User Experience Design Fab understood that their target audience are design-conscious individuals and they are on the website to browse and purchase products catered to their sense of style and interests. Unlike other e-commerce websites, Fab is membership only, easy to use, and truly showcases each product as its own unique entity. By taking a look at their homepage, it looks more like an editorial spread than a site that is filled with tables of products on sale. Large, modular-like grids are used to display promotional items and each fully saturated image corresponds back to Fab’s brand identity. Each picture is engaging and truly does the products justice and encourages product discovery throughout the site. They make it easy by having an excellent refined filtering system. Users can filter by: type of product, designer, price, color, popularity, and what’s featured.  By taking a look at their individual product page, the layout is designed in a way to guide the user into understanding more about the product, shipping information, as well as a time stamp on the duration of that discount offer (enticing users to quickly make the purchase).  Fab isn’t just a medium where people shop for things. They can come here to leisurely and happily browse. Fab’s website is designed more like a magazine filled with eye-catching products that can be saved and shared.   Shifts in Consumer Behavior Fab is also a company that embraces social media and an early adopter in using technology to their advantage. In addition to their online website, Fab is actively present on major social media channels and have their own iOS and Android apps available on mobile devices. Fab does a great job in staying consistent and compatible throughout all their platforms. Now that consumers are spending more time on mobile, Fab’s quick strategy to design a mobile app worked to their advantage. VentureBeat reported that about “one third of Fab’s traffic and sales each day come from mobile”. This number is astounding and reflective of how the modern consumer approaches online shopping. Fab’s mobile application was designed solely with the persona of a “mobile shopper” in mind.  As Goldberg describes Fab, he wanted to create a shopping experience that is “curated, social, exciting, and addictive.”  Everlane is a luxury clothing and design manufacturing company founded in 2010. Their mission is to provide high quality clothing at a relatively low price point by eliminating the middleman cost, which ultimately results in a better and more unique shopping experience for customers. Their philosophy and mission speaks loudly and is translated through their online web presence and design. Everlane specializes in luxury essentials for men and women such as the basic tee, the oxford shirt, sweaters, belts, and scarves.   Above is a screenshot of Everlane’s homepage. Their design embraces simplicity, simple and elegant typography in black and white, and guides the user in experiencing their journey on the website.  First and foremost, Everlane reminds the viewer about what their company is most proud of: their completely transparent business practices. This message is prevalent throughout their website and seamlessly educates the user in understanding where the products came from and the type of materials used in the making of each piece of clothing. By doing this, Everlane is doing something truly disruptive, and differentiates themselves from competing brands. Everlane values their customers and believe that this open communication will enhance their relationship.  Simplicity in design  Above we see an example of how Everlane displays their basic tee products to the consumer. With only 3 photos shown in a row, it makes it easy for the eye to glance through. Upon hovering over an image (eg. the first picture of the white tee), we get a close-up detailed shot of the product as well as sizing options. Below each image, in simple type, we are given the product model name and the price.  On the specific product description page above, users are given 5 different viewpoints of the shirt and an example of how the shirt looks worn on a person. The varying color options are displayed in a visually appealing palette that is also simple in design. The “Add to bag” button is large enough to capture the consumer’s attention but isn’t obstructively intrusive in an alarming way. Using box-like and large icons to refine the filter options is simpler than a drop-down menu. Also, Everlane has made their product images shareable, but instead of the typical Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest options, they have opted to just Pinterest. Why may this be? Perhaps it is because Pinterest is a site that serves to be visually appealing and harbors many inspiring fashion photos whereas sharing on Facebook and Twitter may not be as impactful.  Staying true to what they believe in Last Thanksgiving, Everlane made a bold statement on their website saying they will not participate in the Black Friday sales event. By making this stance, Everlane is showing the public what they truly care about and that they are so firm on their beliefs that a day of monetary gain can’t waver their opinion. Knowing this adds to the user experience about the Everlane brand. The company makes sure to attract people who share their views and they have done a great job in building this community following.   Fab and Everlane are companies that both understand the importance of strong brand design and aesthetic. Lessons we can take away from Fab and Everlane: 1. Understand your target audience and tailor the user experience design to fit their needs 2. Create simple and useful filtering options 3. Ensure uniform design among all channels to maintain consistency Their simplistic user experience paired with unique design elements have garnered them much success online. Fab and Everlane are portrayed as high-quality brands.

A little over a year ago, Chesky reached out and asked if he could travel to Omaha to have lunch, in part to talk about how Airbnb might help expand the number of rooms available in town during Berkshire’s annual meeting weekend. The discussion ended up lasting 4½ hours. Chesky’s biggest takeaway: the value of not getting caught up in the noise. “He’s literally in the center of Omaha,” Chesky says. “There’s no TVs anywhere. He spends all day reading. He takes maybe one meeting a day, and he thinks so deeply.” The experience made such an impact on Chesky that he went to the airport, and, afraid he would forget the conversation, immediately wrote a 3,600-word report and sent it to his team. For his part, Buffett says he sensed in Chesky a genuine passion for building his company: “I think he would be doing what he’s doing if he didn’t get paid a dime for it.” Buffett’s take on Airbnb? “I wish I’d thought of it.”No TVs anywhere.

Happiness. I’m not talking all-the-time, happy-go-lucky kind of a person. I’m talking someone who can genuinely appreciate the good times with you. 3. Clear communication. This is what leads to trust. Look for this in a partner. Communication is key — many people have said this, because it’s true. 4. Self-discipline. The ability to reign yourself in means incredible presence of mind. That usually means a calm interior. 5. Ability to see the good in things. An optimistic person usually means a happy demeanor. 6. Ambition. A good relationship is never stagnant. Always be on the move for that new experience. Make sure your potential LTR is ambitious, too. 7. Respect. Respect for property, animals, other people. This is key. If they do not respect any of the three, then they aren’t good enough for you. 8. Compassion. 9. Ego. Too much and you will find yourself rolling your eyes. Too little and you will find yourself rolling your eyes. A little bit of humility never hurt anyone. 10. Realistic. Everyone has some sort of lofty goal they’d love to achieve, but that’s where reality kicks in. Being realistic, although it may sounds pessimistic at times, lets you reflect on your situation (financial, most of the time). (And for me, because I’m an idealist, to have a realistic partner, that’s a real great partnership to have.) 11. Passion. If the person doesn’t have passion, they have no goals. No passion means no excitement. That’s not a good thing. We as humans should be able to be fired up over something, whether it be sports or pottery or programming. 12. Sense of humor. Quick to laughter, slow to anger. 13. Honesty. Lying is never good, especially when it comes to love. Being upfront with everything is important — which leads back to communication as being one of the foundations of a relationship. If they are honest, that’s a good sign. 14. You can count on them. Dependability is crucial. Nothing sours more quickly than a relationship if you can’t count on each other. 15. Self-reflectiveness. 16. Strong will. A relationship is being able to survive the rough seas and the strong winds. Without a strong will, clouds of doubt will form — and once it’s formed, it’s hard to make it go away. 17. Patience. A good thing takes time to blossom. As they say, Rome wasn’t built overnight. Keep that in mind. 18. Choose someone based on something that you know will last.  " True link

People whose accomplishments don’t come precedented by declarative sentiments of why they are deserving and able, but those who have so honestly worked for what they have and in that work have displayed such intimate parts of themselves that there is no other way to feel but human, not superior. 2. Complete selflessness, whether or not the situation calls for it. People will usually provide for those who are desperately and honestly in need, but it’s the people who are selfless in their day-to-day lives, without the expectation that they’ll be praised for their loving hearts, who are most admirable. 3. Those who retain awareness of themselves and how they could be perceived in light and in acknowledgement of other people’s feelings, intentions, desires and motives. 4. The willingness to learn and the willingness to be wrong. The strength of mind and heart to be open to possibilities that may debunk whatever their sense of peace is resting on. That is evidence of the truest strength a person can have. 5. The ability to express genuine happiness for other people without being resentful or bitter. To be able to remove themselves from their own frame of reference and experience the joy someone else is and understand why they want to share it with them, rather than succumb to the knee-jerk reaction that people only live to make them feel bad about themselves. 6. Genuine confidence, especially in the face of uncertainty. 7. Honesty even when it portrays them in a less than flawless light. People who can be completely upfront about the ways in which they are human, normal, flawed but trying, deceptively deep but honest and hurt but healing are those who understand that what’s greater than proving to others that they’re perfect is bonding with them over the ways that we’re all not. 8. Unconditional empathy. Those who throw doubt and inhibition and question to the wind and honestly feel for another person as though they were the ones having the experience. 9. Knowing that they don’t know it all, and probably never will. 10. A sense of personal style. There’s just something so admirable about people who have their own sense of self that they express outwardly for other people to see and understand. It’s easy to be stylish and attractive in the socially-normative sense. But there’s something endlessly fascinating and compelling about people who are unapologetically themselves, inwardly and outwardly. 11. Unforced gratitude; a curated mindset that everything they have is a privilege and blessing. People who are always thankful for things done for them, no matter how small or insignificant, because they realize that there is nothing more off-putting than those who don’t acknowledge what another person went out of their way to do for them. 12. Respect for that which they don’t understand. 13. Respect for people just because they are also living beings who deserve it innately, regardless of what they’ve chosen, done, believed or said. 14. The ability to hold a great conversation, one that does not revolve around berating someone else or complaining about themselves. 15. Those who don’t take stock in appearances, not theirs and not other people’s. Too often, upon meeting someone we feel the need, almost the social necessity, to describe them physically and backup their imperfections with but they’re such and such a thing. People who see beneath this don’t do that. 16. Admiration, not jealousy, for that which they are incapable of. 17. Understanding, especially in the face of those who act out against them. This is probably the most important one, because most people (myself included) forget that what people do to them and against them has much more to do with that person than themselves. Understanding that is understanding people at a very basic level, a level that is too largely ignored, and results in a growing inability to acknowledge one other as anything other than enemies we should be slated against as opposed to fellow humans who are swaths of intentions and motives and defenses we will probably never understand completely. " True link

One can develop a fairly good understanding of the power and elegance of calculus, say, without actually being able to use it to solve scientific or engineering problems. Think of it this way: you can appreciate art without acquiring the ability to paint, or enjoy a symphony without being able to read music. Math also deserves to be enjoyed for its own sake, without being constantly subjected to the question, “When will I use this?”  Call me an optimist but I believe that humans are innately attracted to mathematics.  Not arithmetic, not number-crunching, but mathematics.  What the difference? Well, that’s practically the same as asking what’s the difference between spelling and literature: the breadth and depth of ideas that encompass what maths is are destroyed if we limit it to just understanding addition and subtraction.  To be fair it’s difficult to define maths and often the abstract nature of the subject can scare people. But, at its heart, maths is a study of patterns. Stretching from basic algebra and geometry to topology and calculus, maths provides an avenue to examine things and draw conclusions (read: proofs) about them. And being able to prove stuff is really cool.  I think one of the reasons that maths is so under-appreciated is because of how it’s taught at schools where the main focuses are arithmetic drills and preparing for tests. It’s very similar, in many ways, to training for an important football match. Sure, you’re only doing long and repetitive drills, but its all to prepare for the main event. And, in this case,  I do fell the main event is worth the wait.  Totally agree!!!" False link

A team of statisticians at Stanford has spent the past few months analyzing 16,700 pictures on Reddit in order to analyze the impact of content, title, community to which it was submitted, and time of submission. Each picture was submitted an average of 7.9 times, which helped the researchers isolate each factor’s impact. What makes a popular submission to the link aggregator that drives more than 4.8 billion pageviews a month? The answer, of course, is “it depends.” The interplay between factors turned out to be hugely important, and different strategies worked for different subreddits, the topic-centric communities on Reddit. Good content “speaks for itself” and may become popular regardless of title, the researchers concluded. However, the title also makes a big difference, as does choice of community. For example, for r/gifs, r/pics, and r/gaming, titles did better when they were somewhat similar to other titles that get submitted to those verticals, but not too similar. For r/atheism and r/gaming, the titles are more formulaic. In those communities, a submission will perform better the more closely its title mirrors other titles in the vertical. " False link
