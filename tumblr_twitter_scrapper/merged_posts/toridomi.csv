It’s pretty simple!THE SHORT VERSION:I animated in Flash! including lip syncI took that, imported it into Krita and did all my clean-up (tracing/sprucing up) there, to get that nice chalky outline and color.That brush is one of the default brushes! (But I turned off opacity).KRITA is AmAZING and FREEEEEEand i love it and i recommend it to everyone (it MAINLY works as a photoshop like program, and if it ever gains the ability to use TPL brush files, im never touching photoshop again.  Otherwise, i use it for 99% of everything I do).Tuyoki/Tem introduced it to me and you can also animate in it like she does, it just doesnt have the ability (yet??) to import sound clips to do stuff like Lip Sync, but its great if you want a FREE PROGRAM (ScreAMS) to learn and practice animation in!!!! THE LONG VERSION:First, I did all my animating in Flash! I’m talking every movement/motion and all the lip sync! I did the entire thing on one file/timeline so I could make sure shots flowed well. This only worked bc I only really animated lip sync, everything else was keyframes. If I had smooth actual animation I would have had to cut my sound and file up into chunks for smaller file size (less lag).Then! I exported the whole thing as a .png sequence. Next, I went into my export folder, and separated the big sequence into around 10 chunks of 2-3 shots per part, and gave each chunk its own folder.I imported these chunks into Krita, and just traced/fixed stuff like I would do clean up normally in Flash!!I used this default brush.And thats really it! I exported from krita and sewed the pieces together in After Effects into One Big Video (also doing all the News Looking stuff/text), then took that into Premiere to link it with the sound clip (and that “breaking news” music)Anyway sorry I rant. One day I’ll make a proper flash/krita tutorial. One day.this post is thanks to @graveyard-eyes @xenopes + the 8 anons that asked" True text

I was dumb and scared and stopped cold turkey on top of that, and went through withdrawal for 8 days.  It was sudden, they had been making me feel stable for a while but suddenly 5 weeks in I became even more depressed than my breakdown this October and I lost a faith in life that I never even knew I had.  I can finally sleep and dream again (couldn’t for 5 days, after 3 days of not a single wink, I could only close eyes and drift slightly before weird shocks woke me up).  I’m filled with anxiety every time I lay down now, though. And I’m anxious about life in a way I never was thanks to the intrusive thoughts that haunted me those 8 days, and now sort of continue to.  I’m so scared of life and death and relationships and work now. I don’t know how people do it. I don’t know how I did it.  Fuck. I even wished I was religious during this whole thing. That I could lean on some kind of faith. idk if I ever can be, or if it would have even helped against the chemical turmoil happening in my brain, but I still kind of wish it.  I’m going to take it one day at a time for now, but I really hope I get some of my will and vigor back. It’s very lonely without it.

Tumblr is always asking for games for more diversity, and this is exactly that. Support the games that are giving you exactly what you asked for.  I played the prototype of the game on the PSN …. it’s actually super fun, and the animation is absolutely beautiful.

[[MOR]Can you explain the problem with this more? Im not trying to fight against it, i just dont understand why this would be considered offensiveThey drew a shirtless pre-op trans boyThey aren’t a trans boyAnd obviously their Kurapika headcanon has him as dysphoric, which is why he’s bindingSo drawing him without the binder on, while not being a trans boy???thats uh?you dont see people drawing trans women with dicksi’ll leave it at that I’m genderfluid and experience dysphoria on a regular basis. However, sometimes I don’t. There are days I wish I could bind (I can’t it makes me claustrophobic) and there are days I don’t care about it.My HC for Kurapika leans towards Demi boy. Kurapika has always read as very neutral and fluid for me and my headcanon has him feeling differently about his dysphoria depending on situation and time (like I do) I’m really really sorry for triggering you (or anyone else), but I don’t like the assumption that I don’t experience dysphoria bc I’m not strictly a Trans-boy. (Or that all trans boys experience dysphoria all the time…I know plenty that don’t…)Also while there are issues of fetishization and over sexualization of trans bodies, if done respectfully and humanely, art of trans bodies that present trans bodies as they are could help normalize the idea that gender and genitalia aren’t related, and maybe? maybe dysphoria could occur in less people or help normalize the idea that operation shouldn’t be necessary to consider someone “fully transitioned” (considering trans people have existed long before operations have)So as a trans kid, who experiences dysphoria, I fully support artists, trans or not, depicting trans bodies, nude or not, as diversely as possible. Just learn from my mistake and tag things with more empathy. (And I want to be clear it WAS a mistake and a very insensitive mistake on my part, bc I should know not everyone experiences dysphoria the same way I do)I’ve tagged the drawing now with a dysphoria warning, and again I’m really really sorry. But the issue is much more complicated than “if you’re not x-trans then you can’t depict or sympathize with x-trans people”" False text

Your experience here is really relative to the major you choose imo. The schools pays more attention to the COMD majors- illustration, graphic design, and I think packaging design/industrial design?  They get first dibs on the illustration electives which are a lot of the good electives that would be helpful to us animation students.  The fashion department is pretty nice from what I hear! And I think lots of good connections come out of there.  Animation (my major) is steadily growing and getting more funding because there’ve been lots of hardworking students making this place look good for the school.  Your first year at Pratt, however, is pretty much the same for most majors besides film, writing, and art education. they call it Foundation Year and everyone takes 3D, LCD, Drawing, 4D, Art History, Literature, and Civilizations (I think? that might be sophomore year) The Big Bummer is that you don’t get to choose professors for foundation year, they’re chosen for you and it’s a big hit or miss as to whether you get someone that is good vs someone that drives you insane. Most of those courses will be you and the same group of people, so they can be a hit or miss too. I got along with my group really well but we weren’t 100% compatible as people which didn’t cause any trouble but I sometimes felt lonely.  I mention all this bc professors and the people in my environment are something that are really important to me and my mental health.  Still, as long as you go in knowing that your first year could be pretty shitty you’ll be able to hold out. But! it could also be fantastic!!  Clubs are important AF!!!! for finding people you get along with and getting you through freshman year. There’s Anime Club and Video Game Club and of course!! Keyframe Animation Club (holla I’m pres next yr). Theres also a comic club, I don’t know if anyone is taking over after the seniors though but hopefully it’s around.  We are a school relatively devoid of weeaboos so usually the clubs are a good spot to meet good people despite the dorkiness that we all emanate. Comic club is a little more indie/underground geared than commercial geared but usually they have fun activities.  NOW. DDA. My major.  It’s still pretty bare bones for 2D students, there are a lot of mandatory classes that are relatively useless bc the professors that teach them aren’t really good at teaching or are frustrating as people. If you come to club we talk about electives that sometimes help make up for the lack of learning that goes on.  The animation courses are relatively good! You usually get a pick between Mike or Aaron. Mike is the head of 2D and while better at explaining things the first time around, he’s not very good at pointing out fundamentals that people are lacking during critique. I think he thinks everyone can see what is wrong in their piece they just don’t have the drawing skills to accomplish it? Unsure. Aaron gives you a lot more freedom in terms of assignments (and finals) and I regret not taking him for all my animation courses. he’s super quiet though and will critique pretty well but won’t give you tips until you ask. if you talk to him regularly tho he like becomes a giant ball of goof it’s amazing to see the transformation happen in seconds.  either way, the classes themselves WILL NOT BE ENOUGH. This is true for all 2D dda, we do not learn storyboarding, we do not learn how to properly compose shots, we do not learn industry standards of any of these processes, we do not learn flash or toon boom from professors, we do not learn color scripting, etc etc (mike taught a little flash/toonboom but only once and it’s easy to forget) there’s a storyboarding elective and a flash elective (that may not be taught anymore bc the one prof that teaches it got a full time studio job and is leaving) but you have to be aware of them, of everything.  we have cintiqs tho! and those are quite amazing.  so it’s important to build relationships w upperclassmen! (mostly through club, or helping on senior or junior films!) I HONESTLY AND WHOLE HEARTEDLY RECOMMEND: If you are from a relatively healthy home and can get work done in your house, I really recommend taking a year off after high school, part timing for money, saving up for a 22HD cintiq and just taking online art courses on storyboarding and illustration.  a degree in illustration or animation is NOT THAT IMPORTANT for breaking into the industry. At most the connections gained at college are the most important, but imo not worth the 55k a year here.  I HAD to because my life at home was not good and I couldn’t work and could barely function there.  you can make connections online (my skype is Krispy.kitten if anyone else needs advice or wants to chat! I’ll be taking my time to answer tho haha) by reaching out to artists or actively engaging in art communities and online courses! And going to your closest nude drawing sessions! as often as you can. (there’s usually more local nude drawing events than you’d think) if that year off doesn’t help or you don’t feel you’ve improved THEN I would start thinking about college.  if your parents want you doing something, taking science and history courses at your local college could earn you transfer credit so u don’t have to do elective bs at pratt (but check with the colleges u hope to apply to! even if u have to call or email, make sure they take the credit of whatever college and ask Whether it is changed from a science credit to a liberal arts credit-u don’t want it changing usually) ANYWAY LONG POST  I plan on making a tutorial over the summer for basic flash and basic animation techniques too! bc I don’t see those around ever so stay tuned!   good luck and feel free to ask anything of me whenever !"

Ajanae What if one day my brothers are walking down the street and the police try to beat them or even kill [them]? Dorian It hurts to know that a policeman, somebody who is hired and paid to protect me, has shot and killed a young man. This young man Mike Brown had his whole life ahead of him only 18 about to start college in a few days. It hurts me knowing somebody has it in them to kill somebody so easily. This is more than hurtful it’s shameful, racist, ignorant, and just sad. I think the protests have been good. What do you expect when something so ignorant happens? … I understand some things like looting and firing up stores seem crazy and uncalled for but if we’re not peacefully getting justice this is what has to be done. Kerriana I know and everyone knows that Darren Wilson had no right to shoot Michael Brown. Michael was unarmed and he surrendered. He had his hands up in the air. I’m mad because showing the footage of Michael Brown stealing from a convenient store was so irelevent and unimportant. I don’t like that when they put the video out, they were trying to make Michael look bad, look like a criminal. Tykese I feel like the things that are happening in Ferguson are unfair. I thought after Trayvon Martin the killing will stop but it comes back again. What did Mike Brown do for the police officer to kill him? If he was a caucasian male will he still shoot?

And, quite frankly, because white people have a role in undoing racism because white people created and, for the most part, currently maintain (whether they want to or not) the racist system that benefits white people to the detriment of people of color. My white friends who’ve spoken out harshly against the murder of Michael Brown end with a similar refrain: What can I do that will matter in the fight against racism? White people who are sick and tired of racism should work hard to become white allies. In the aftermath of the murder of Michael Brown, may he rest in power, here are some ways for white people to become white allies who are engaged thoughtfully and critically in examining the situation in Ferguson and standing on the side of justice and equity. This list is a good place to start your fight to dismantle racial inequity and shine a light on the oppressive structures that lead to yet another extrajudicial killing of a black person. 1. Learn about the racialized history of Ferguson and how it reflects the racialized history of America.  Michael Brown’s murder is not a social anomaly or statistical outlier. It is the direct product of deadly tensions born from decades of housing discrimination, white flight, intergenerational poverty and racial profiling. The militarized police response to peaceful assembly by the people mirrors what happened in the 1960s during the Civil Rights Movement…" False link

They’re happening all around the country tonight, including at the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, around 7 p.m. Eastern.  2. Recognize that Michael Brown’s death was not an isolated incident. In 2012, more than 300 black people were executed by police, security guards, or vigilantes. In the last month, three other unarmed African-American men—Eric Garner in New York, John Crawford III in Beavercreek, Ohio, and Ezell Ford in Los Angeles—have been killed by police. Those are the ones we know about. 3. Stop saying “This can’t be happening in America.” I understand the impulse, I really do. But that impulse only comes to those who are insulated and isolated from how America treats poor people and people of color every day. Langston Hughes wrote “America never was America to me” in 1935. If you didn’t quite understand that poem in your junior high or high-school lit classes, read it again, while you think about what’s happening in Ferguson. Let it sink in. 4. STFU about looting. And call out your friends and family members who won’t. It’s been five days since Michael Brown was murdered. On one of those days, some furious, grieving citizens caused some property damage. Nine have been arrested. Every other day since then, police with more gear than American soldiers going into battle have been occupying the neighborhood where Brown died, attacking peaceful protestors with tear gas and rubber bullets. They’ve tear-gassed a state senator and Al-Jazeera reporters, and arrested an alderman. They’ve demanded that reporters leave the area and arrested two who didn’t move fast enough. “Disproportionate” doesn’t begin to describe it. If you look at all that and still think it’s important to talk about looting for “balance,” you should know that you sound like a racist asshole. 5. Look Around You. If you live in an urban environment, you’re in a position to bear witness and document inappropriate and abusive police behavior. If you see an African-American neighbor being detained by police, wait to see what happens. Get your phone out. Download the ACLU’s “Police Tape” app, and if you see something that looks off, take a video that will upload directly to their servers, in case your phone is confiscated. Whatever police may tell you, this is your legal right. 6. Make a donation to a civil rights organization like the Southern Poverty Law Center or the ACLU. 7. Educate yourself about the systematic inequality that leads to civil unrest. The St. Louis American ran a powerful editorial today that fleshes out the history of Ferguson. When you finish reading that, go somewhere quiet for a bit and settle down with Ta-Nehisi Coates’s “The Case for Reparations.” Don’t stop there. 8. Put pressure on your elected representatives. Institutional abuse of African-American citizens is happening all over the country, and it demands a federal response. Talk to your senators and congresspeople about enacting policies to protect citizens from their protectors. While you’re at it, maybe suggest they work to limit the amount of military weaponry police can inherit from the armed forces. 9. Listen to your African-American friends when they try to tell you why this hurts. If you don’t have any African-American friends, you might want to think about why that is. 10. Okay, go ahead and tweet. And Facebook. Tumblr. Instagram. Vine. Amplify the voices of people on the ground, and help counteract the damaging narratives being propagated by some mainstream media organizations. It’s the very least we can do.  Written by Kate Harding   Sorry for reblogging this to an art blog, but (as a white person myself) I find this super useful and important. The demonstrations are not “bullshit” and people are not “just trying to find an excuse to do whatever they want”. Human beings simply don’t do this kind of stuff for no good reason. I don’t work like that, I doubt you work like that. Give some credit to others. There is always a good reason, and the only way to find it out is by sitting down and listening carefully.

In years past Campus Pride has only featured the 25 top-ranking schools as shown by the Campus Pride Index, a tool the group uses to assess LGBT-friendly policies and programs at colleges across the country. This year, 56 schools achieved the maximum rating of five stars. There’s been high demand for information and schools everywhere have been taking strides to make friendlier campuses, so this year the list is expanded to a top 50.  Just last week, the Princeton Review released its own list of LGBT-friendly and unfriendly schools, and there is very little overlap. Campus Pride says the difference is that its list is created “for and by” LGBT experts in higher ed.  Click the link above for more info about how these schools were chosen, or click its name below for more details about its rating. Until then, here’s the list:  Amherst CollegeAugsburg CollegeBrown UniversityCentral Washington UniversityConnecticut CollegeCornell UniversityDartmouth CollegeEmory UniversityHarvard UniversityIndiana UniversityIthaca CollegeMacalester CollegeNorthern Arizona UniversityOberlin CollegeOregon State UniversityPomona CollegePortland State UniversityPrinceton UniversityRutgers UniversitySan Diego State UniversitySouthern Illinois University CarbondaleSouthern Oregon UniversityStanford UniversitySyracuse UniversityThe Ohio State UniversityThe Pennsylvania State UniversityTulane UniversityUniversity of California, BerkeleyUniversity of California, Los AngelesUniversity of California, RiversideUniversity of California, Santa BarbaraUniversity of California, Santa CruzUniversity of Central FloridaUniversity of ChicagoUniversity of Illinois at ChicagoUniversity of Maryland, College ParkUniversity of Massachusetts, AmherstUniversity of MichiganUniversity of Minnesota – DuluthUniversity of Minnesota – Twin CitiesUniversity of OregonUniversity of PennsylvaniaUniversity of Rhode IslandUniversity of Southern CaliforniaUniversity of VermontUniversity of WashingtonUniversity of Wisconsin – MilwaukeeWarren Wilson CollegeWashington State UniversityWashington University in St. Louis  So many schools! Is yours on the list? Smith isn’t on here thank god (it was last year, just as they rejected a trans woman applicant because they are an “all women’s school” (despite accepting trans men). I’m sad my alma mater isn’t on here but another nearby state college is. My school is very trans friendly and had gender neutral bathrooms. Then again, I don’t know how it stacked up against other schools. I didn’t ID as nonbinary at the time and i didn’t know then what I know now about LGBT issues. Pretty sure most of these do not have gender neutral bathrooms? Nor terribly strong communities?There are problems with courses relating to gender/sexuality here on Pratt, and they’re limited (one or two classes?) and outdated. And administration is pretty lacking in understanding, ie not allowing registration of sex/name to be different than what’s on ur state ID or Birth Records which means having to explain to teachers gender and name changes over and over. But the lgbtqia community is huge and strong and loud and diverse. So I wonder how they’re rating these schools? My friend goes to Wash U STL and (correct me on this friend?) hasn’t really mentioned feeling any kind of community and has experienced a really really unsafe harassment situation that the school DID NOT TAKE CARE OF and was EXTREMELY victim blamey, which was UNRELATED to lgbtqia stuff so I can only imagine how little they take care of  forms of harassment directed at lgbtqia students."

Why the beating of Marlene Pinnock isn’t on all of our lips. Why the nation is not familiar with the names of Stephanie Maldonado, or of Ersula Ore. And how many women’s names do we not know because they don’t dare come forward? Because the violence they experience at the hands of the police is sexual, and the shame and stigma around sexual violence silences them? The truth is that, in the predominantly male-led civil rights organizations who lead efforts to respond to police brutality, in the male-dominated media that covers them, and in the hearts and minds of many people in this country, women who are of color, who are sex workers, undocumented immigrants, transgender (or, god forbid, more than one of those at once) are rarely candidates for “innocence,” and are often blamed for their own deaths, forgotten, or hardly counted at all. Women of color who are targeted by the police, and black women in particular, are seen as so disposable, so far from being moral actors, that their lives and deaths are just passed over by the mainstream — their victimization and murder just another facet of the American landscape. Aiyana Jones’ case is the last time that I can remember a black girl’s murder by the police gaining significant national attention; she was seven years old. I stand with the people of Ferguson. I see and share their rage. And I want to also see national rage for the deaths of women of color. I want to see widespread rage for the staggering number of trans lives lost. As a nation, we’re at a tipping point on racist, state-sanctioned violence, and we have the opportunity and power to turn our collective rage into systemic change. We must be diligent that demands that come out of this historical moment are for all of us, from all of us.” " False link

In a second press conference hours later, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson admitted that Brown’s shooting was unrelated to the incident. Jackson told reporters that Brown and a friend were in fact stopped, “because they were walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic.” He also admitted that Darren Wilson, the officer who killed Brown, didn’t suspect Brown at the time that he stopped him. When Chief Jackson was asked by reporters why his department chose to release the robbery tape if it was unrelated to the shooting, he replied that he had to because “the media asked for it.”  Who says social media doesn’t make a difference?
