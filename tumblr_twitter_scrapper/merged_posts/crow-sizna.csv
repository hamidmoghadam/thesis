Six months ago I asked you to help me because my parents kicked me out after they found out I‚Äôve fallen in love with a girl. I was working in their place and I lost that job too. My boyfriend at that moment told everyone I know about this and spread some lies. He took my dog and a lot of my stuff. He stalked me. He found my tumblr as well and I had to make a new account. I live in my friend house but it was really small so I slept on the floor in the pantry for the last five months.  Now I live in a tiny tiny room and have half time job as a waitress.¬† Two months ago I finally went to psychiatrist and I was diagnosed with severe depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder. It was a lot to finally have someone to talk to about everything.The problem is that I don‚Äôt have the money for all of these meds she prescripted me. I already take asthma medications for couple of years and others for my sensitive stomach. The meds from psychiatrist are quite expensive because I had to choose private payd visit instead of free because they told me I had to wait four months for it. And I can‚Äôt wait that long. I have suicide thoughts and I‚Äôm afraid what I could do. And I‚Äôm still waiting for the therapy. These are my meds now   And the proof of how much they cost    I can‚Äôt really afford for all of them right now.¬†And I really need to use them because I already feel a little better and I don‚Äôt want to be depressed anymore. And I don‚Äôt really have money for even food. I mostly eat only twice a day. I hope this is enough proof for people who are attacking me saying that I‚Äôm lying. I‚Äôm from Poland and here if you go to the private doctor you need to pay 100% for the meds even with the insurance. And the rest of them is still expensive even with 10 or 30% being cheaper. Also we don‚Äôt have any coupons for meds and any apps. You have that in America, that‚Äôs great. But we don‚Äôt. And this month my doctor added some new meds for my asthma (i had spirometry test and it came out pretty bad)¬†and because of that right now I don‚Äôt have anough money to pay my rent.  I talked with my landorld who is a sweet older lady and she is so wonderful that she let me be a little late with my rent. So I have time to the end of the month. I‚Äôve made new posts and least five times because every time the post hits 1k notes people are starting to ignore it, thinking I already have thousand of dollars. Well I don‚Äôt, because people are just mostly reblogging it. I know some people are annoyed by my friend asking everyone to reblog my post. She only wants to help me, because we know each other from childhood and now she is far away from me and can‚Äôt really help me. Please don‚Äôt be mean to her. She is an angel.And you are also annoying with me (if the messages about me just killing myself because i‚Äôm dirty lazy fagot tells anything) but please bear with me for few more days. I‚Äôm trying, I really am but it‚Äôs hard when you are all alone. So if you could spare few dollars please send them via paypal My email: ¬†anne.du@mail.com You can choose any currency you want. Thank you for any help! And please reblog this post. " False text

Which was a PAIN to compile the info for. Anno can vouch for that. Now there are a few extras at the end. A reminder that this list is for PRE-REBOOT and is not at all canon for the New 52, which isn‚Äôt surprising since everyone‚Äôs height varies so extremely between artists these days. -x-x-x- No one seems to really realize all of this unless they look it up all at once, but the size differences between the members of the Bat-family are very surprising. ~~~ PRE-REBOOT ~~~Bruce Wayne/Batman: 6‚Äô 2‚Äù, 210lbs and no one knows what his age is supposed to be anymore.

Birthday: August 16thTim Drake/Red Robin: 5‚Äô 5‚Äù 125lbs, and is roughly 17 years old now. Birthday: July 19thDamian Wayne/Robin: (4‚Äô 6‚Äù / 84lbs) - (5‚Äô 2‚Äù / 120lbs) -¬† (5‚Äô 4‚Äù / 140lbs),¬† height & weight varies by artist, appearance since creation, and info source. He is roughly 10-11 years old now. Birthday:¬†??? Barbara Gordon/Batgirl: 5‚Äô 7‚Äù 126lbs, and is VERY roughly between Dick and Bruce‚Äôs age. Her age was retconned so many times it‚Äôs impossible to get an exact age. However, until it became officially inappropriate for underage relationships in recent years, Babs was always quite a few years older than Dick. Birthday: September 23 (according to an OLD DC calender) Cassandra Cain/Batgirl: 5‚Äô 5‚Äù 127lbs, and is roughly 19 years old. Birthday: January 26th (celebrated) Stephanie Brown/Batgirl: 5‚Äô 5‚Äù 129lbs, and is roughly 18-19 years old. Birthday: August 11th (comic first appearance)The ages/weights/heights are the proper ages according to several official DC reference pages/books prior to the reboot. Who knows what they are after really. I‚Äôm not sure DC really knows either. Every time I post this someone pops in to dispute it, but I‚Äôm only going off of what DC has officially said even if it doesn‚Äôt always make sense. We can all say DC has screwed up plenty over the years. EXTRAS:  Alfred Pennyworth: 5‚Äô 10‚Äù 160lbs   Talia al Ghul: 5‚Äô 8‚Äù 141lbs (comics) and 5‚Äô 6‚Äù (BtAS)   Selina Kyle: 5‚Äô 7‚Äù 133lbs (comics) and 5‚Äô 6‚Äù (BtAS)   James (Jim) Gordon: 6‚Äô 0"" 168lbs   Prudence Wood: taller than both Tim and Steph but shorter than Dick, putting her at roughly 5‚Äô6‚Äù- 5‚Äô9‚Äù  Tam Fox: Noticeably shorter than Tim, Steph, and Vicki Vale so likely around 5‚Äô3‚Äù  Sasha (Scarlet): Noticeably about a head shorter than Jason but a bit taller than Damian, so she is in the range of 5‚Äô6‚Äù Conclusion?-Tim is tiny as all hell, and needs to eat. He really is the ‚ÄòBaby Bird‚Äô. Tim is officially SEVEN inches shorter than Jason, and 100lbs lighter. Both Steph and Cass are his height but weigh more, even if only by a touch.-Jason is actually taller than Dick, and heavier than Bruce.-Damian is going to be built like a damned linebacker, and will probably be larger than Bruce in height AND weight. He is only an inch shorter than Tim and is 15lbs heavier, while being 6 years younger. (if of course going off his larger size range I initially recorded last year, and also believable by FutureBatDamian‚Äôs size)  James (Jim) Gordon: 6‚Äô 0"" 168lbs  reblogging this largely for me to use as a reference.

He nodded at it. ‚ÄúAlso, you‚Äôre moving that thing before everyone starts dancing. No way we‚Äôre risking someone‚Äôs drunk ass knocking it over.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, obviously ‚Äî wait, what?‚Äù Steve frowned, his brow crinkling, all adorable-like. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt want a first dance? How come?‚Äù Bucky shrugged. ‚ÄúBecause we‚Äôre not big spotlight people? And this puts us front and center while people watch us dance. And that just‚Ä¶‚Äù He bit back a smile. ‚ÄúThis is just gonna be so embarrassing for you.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, you mean seeing as how you can‚Äôt dance?‚Äù Bucky scoffed, even as he turned in Steve‚Äôs arms. ‚ÄúExcuse you, no one in our neighborhood could do a better Foxtrot than me.‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, you keep telling yourself that, Buck.‚Äù Bucky laughed, even as the first strains of Fred Astaire‚Äôs The Way You Look Tonight picked up. The song had been such an easy pick for both of them, seeing as how it was the song they‚Äôd spent an entire night listening to when Bucky had taught Steve how to dance. Someday, when I‚Äôm awfully low‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúYou know for someone who claims I can‚Äôt dance, I sure do remember you begging me to teach you how,‚Äù Bucky teased, as they turned slowly around the dance floor, going at their own pace despite the midtempo of the song. ‚ÄúOh, please.‚Äù Steve gripped his hand, and Bucky laughed as Steve spun him out before pulling him back in close. He really was a good dancer, the grace of a fighter transitioning smoothly into dance steps. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt beg you. You were the one who begged me to let you teach me. Something about how I‚Äôd get dates faster that way.‚Äù There is nothing for me but to love you‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúJoke‚Äôs on you, though,‚Äù Steve went on. He tightened his grip on Bucky‚Äôs waist, and Bucky was certain his heart was fit to burst. Any moment now. ‚ÄúBecause you were right. Letting you teach me how to dance really did get me a date faster. Got me a dancing date with you that very night.‚Äù  And it‚Äôs done!! Stephrc79 has finally finished her fic The Wedding of Bucky Barnes! It was A LOT of work! Congratulations on your hard work and thank you for this great fic!!        ‚ù§  " False link

According to the Pokemon Go privacy policy, Niantic may collect ‚Äî among other things ‚Äî your email address, IP address, the web page you were using before logging into Pokemon Go, your user name, and your location. And if you use your Google account for sign-in, unless you specifically revoke it, Niantic has access to your entire Google account. That means Niantic has read and write access to your email, Google Drive docs, and more. (It also means that if the Niantic servers are hacked, whoever hacked the servers would potentially have access to your entire Google account. And you can bet the game‚Äôs extreme popularity has made it a target for hackers. Given the number of children playing the game, that‚Äôs a scary thought.)

Special shout out to the suit porn descriptions by @boopifer. Go love up on her. ~~~~ They linked hands and, sure enough, there was that calm again. Steve felt warm and solid at his side, his grip firm and a perfect fit in Bucky‚Äôs own. This was just‚Ä¶right. This was where Bucky belonged for the rest of his life. They had been through so much in their lives. They knew the fire and ice that could only come from walking through Hell to find peace on the other side. And right now, Steve was looking at Bucky like he, too, knew that peace. Like he, too, had found that crystalline lake of serenity. All noise gone, just the quiet around them and the beating of their own hearts. Nothing else. Right now belonged to no one but them. And Bucky could cry with how deeply, incandescently happy he was. The music shifted, and so did Steve‚Äôs grip in his hand. The doors ‚Äî which had been shut in preparation for their grand entrance ‚Äî blew open to a sea of silvers, blacks, and whites. Ornate chandeliers dropped down over silver chairs tied with shimmering black cords, each one filled with all the people they loved, and breached down the middle by a carpet of intricate black and white, the aisle that led up to their forever. But Bucky didn‚Äôt see any of it. The only thing he could see ‚Äî the only thing he ever wanted to see ‚Äî was Steve‚Äôs face smiling back at him as they walked down that aisle. A blur behind unshed tears, but there all the same.   They stopped at the altar, and the music faded out, and it took everything Bucky had not to lean in and feel those lips against his own. Lips he‚Äôd kissed thousands upon thousands of times, and yet he was certain would feel brand new in the here and now. " False link

You are saying you would rather see the small ways in which humanity can fail than the enormous ways in which we are capable of being extraordinary.  so that terrible vulture article happened, and i had furious feelings all over my shiny new wordpress may go up on medium later, after i‚Äôve gotten some feedback; for now, enjoy  Ok this shit.
