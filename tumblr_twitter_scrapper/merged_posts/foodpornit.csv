Food isn’t about snobbery, it’s about love. #WriteThatDownB) Fat is the love of food. Not an insult. Skinny people can be fat. Healthy people can be fat. When we talk about someones love for food, we just call them fat, it doesn’t matter what they look like." True text

Food Porn taken with Instagram and other image altering applications. While I appreciate the novelty of taking pictures and transforming them into really cool vintage-looking photos…. who wants to eat/look at vintage (read: old) food? What I love most about all of these new smart-phones is the ability to take a high resolution picture with 5+ megapixels. Get the camera lens in there so we can see the textures of the food, the sauce the plate/paper it’s served on. Let the dish be the star of your photo, not the third party application that turned into a sepia food photo with frayed edges.  Clearly, I don’t speak for everyone, but as someone who really… REALLY wants to repost your beautiful food for the masses to drool over, please just shoot really cool food pictures without “apping” them! (like the sexy pizza cone that I’ve displayed below) Hungrily yours, That Guy @FoodPorn " True text
