Ironically, they are worse at delivering their message than people who speak English as a second or third language, according to Chong. “A lot of native speakers are happy that English has become the world’s global language. They feel they don’t have to spend time learning another language,” says Chong. “But… often you have a boardroom full of people from different countries communicating in English and all understanding each other and then suddenly the American or Brit walks into the room and nobody can understand them.” “Native speakers of English generally are monolingual and are not very good at tuning into language variation,” professor Jennifer Jenkins says. The non-native speakers, it turns out, speak more purposefully and carefully, typical of someone speaking a second or third language. Anglophones, on the other hand, often talk too fast for others to follow, and use jokes, slang and references specific to their own culture, says Chong. In emails, they use baffling abbreviations such as ‘OOO’, instead of simply saying that they will be out of the office. “The native English speaker… is the only one who might not feel the need to accommodate or adapt to the others,” she adds.  The article Taming the Steamroller has useful suggestions about ways to do better as a native English speaker communicating with non-native speakers. " False link
