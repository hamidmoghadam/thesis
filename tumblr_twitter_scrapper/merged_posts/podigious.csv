podigious 146711413289 "2016-06-30 17:23:41 GMT" http://podigious.tumblr.com/post/146711413289/my-digimon-tri-recording-experience "jeffnimoyanime: Holy DigiCrap, one little announcement and the whole Internet goes crazy! I had no idea that the English dubbing of Digimon Tri wasn’t public knowledge until I announced I recorded Tentomon again. No one asked me not to tell anyone, so I guess it’s ok to talk about it. I am getting flooded with questions, so rather than answering each one individually, here is how it all happened.For a long time now fans kept asking me if I was going to be in Digimon Tri. My last experience with Digimon was script adaptation, voice directing, voice acting, and being Supervising Producer on Digimon Data Squad (previously Digimon Savers). Even though it’s the least known series in the franchise, it’s my personal favorite, so I hope this renewed 15th anniversary interest in Digimon makes fans give it a second look. Since then I knew they dubbed Fusion without me, so I assumed whatever production company was in charge of the franchise now had moved on without me.But then I got a call from Studiopolis and asked me to voice Tentomon again for Tri. They didn’t ask me to write or direct, just act. Of course, I would have loved to do all those things again for Digimon, but even just the involvement of voice acting is thrilling enough because it means a return to the series that I loved and made me famous (plus, there are a lot less headaches and a lot less work to do when you’re only acting).I came back to the familiar Studiopolis offices and met an engineer/voice director named Ryan. Never met him before, and he didn’t tell me his last name, so that’s all I know. But he was a very nice guy, and seemed to know the series well, and he was a very good director. There were 4 episodes written, but I can’t remember if Tentomon was in all of them or not.I had just got off a redeye flight from New York, and my voice was rather raw. I actually asked if they would reschedule because I didn’t think I could get to Tentomon’s higher register until I had a few days rest, but they wanted me to come in and give it a try (Tri?). I did my best, but when it comes out, Tentomon might sound a little horse for the first few episodes. 3 days later my voice sounds fine again, so maybe my next session I can go back and re-record the first ones again if they haven’t already mixed the sound (it was only about 8 lines, so we could do it real quick).My last line for Tentomon at that session was “Tentomon digivolve to….Kabuterimon!” Ryan told me he wasn’t sure how they were going to do it, so they wanted me to say “Kabuterimon” in Tentomon’s voice. I told him that Kabuterimon says that part, not Tentomon. Ryan asked, “Are you sure?” I laughed and said, “Yeah, pretty sure.” Lol. After all those episodes and movies, I had better be sure! Ryan laughed as well and took my word for it. He knew my involvement with the series, so he trusted me. We actually got along quite well, and he was very open to collaboration.During playbacks I recognized some other voices (get ready to break again, Internet). Colleen O’Shaughnessy as Sora, and Mona Marshall as Izzy. I’m good friends with Doug Erholtz, so I knew he WASN’T playing TK (he is playing a recurring role though). Ryan told me my old TriGun partner Johnny Yong Bosch was playing TK. I also recognized Laura Summer’s voice as Patomon. Ryan told me almost all the digimon voices are coming back, but many of the humans were recast. That’s ALL I KNOW! Please, no more questions, you now know exactly what I know, so we’re all caught up!I’m looking forward to my next VO session as Tentomon (although after I blew the surprise, maybe they’ll fire me, oh well). One more thing… after my session was over, I went into the control room to say goodbye to Ryan, and thank him. We shook hands and I asked, “Please take good care of my baby, won’t you?” He smiled and said, “Absolutely, it’s in good hands.” I’m sure it is!" False text

Japanese spoiler blog Alternator reported today that the latest issue of V Jump magazine contains an announcement of a new upcoming Digimon series, Digimon Universe Applimonsters. Said to be an Autumn 2016 collaboration between Bandai, Bandai Namco Entertainment, and Toei Animation, Universe Applimonsters is supposed to encompass a toyline, TV anime series, and video games. Alternator acquired the information via a furage (“Flying  Get”) meaning they acquired an issue of the magazine more than a day  ahead of its street date. Such acquisitions are made possible by paying  off middleman distributors, or stores that get their stock early. Alternator’s original statement with an English translation is provided below the jump.  Whether this news is to be regarded as trustworthy or not is a source of contention. The facts are as follows; Alternator has  been around since April 2013, and in that time seems to have maintained  a clean record, not attempting to spread hoaxes. The other statement in  their post, that Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 will be announced for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, was proven true four and a half hours after they first reported it. Alternator normally labels rumors, but is treating Digimon Universe as fact. No other source has corroborated the Universe  story, but the site also has a number of other claims made around the  same time, and confirming or debunking them may point to the reliability  of the Universe story;  Keep reading  internal screaming good screaming? bad screaming?
