Here’s my opinion on this tall order as an actor on the show, so take it with a grain of salt. While a smaller season (13 episodes) would keep the narratives more succinct, a larger season would compliment our show in the exact way we have all been wanting. What you guys probably don’t know, because you’re only seeing the final product, is that we cut a TON of footage from this season due to timing. If nothing shot was omitted, we, realistically, would have had around 17 episodes worth of content. We’re a huge ensemble for a show. Massive. And were only getting bigger. With Kevin becoming a series regular in season two, and the introduction of a host of new, fundamental, characters to the season, a taller order will give us space to discuss characters that many people feel didn’t get the screen time they deserved (which we all agree with). it will also benefit us with negative space. What do I mean by negative space? I mean silence. Silence is a fundamental, drama building rule for entertainment. Actors will often bury a lot of micro expressions within that silence, and that can lend itself to character development. negative space is something season 1, truthfully, doesn’t have a lot of. And a larger season will allow us to keep and hold our voices in scenes that I believe will serve the quality of our show. Another thing to consider, is that the majority of our audience comes from digital mediums such as the CW app and netflix. With our introduction to US netflix this month, many people will be binging our show all at once. A larger season only assists this kind of digestion. Lastly, a larger season keeps everyone on the crew working :) many families will be very pleased to have a larger working order. As of now, I can’t spoil too much, but we are not planning on any “filler” episodes. Considering how jam packed season 1 was, a larger order will allow us to re-infuse the show with a lot of the neo-noir genre elements we all grew to love as a cast and crew. We’re all very excited to start working, and equally excited for you guys to see all our prospective work. -Cole  Have some faith in the guy come on.  https://www.reddit.com/user/ColeMSprouse " False text

He’s going to a different school, living in a different area of town. Perhaps most significantly, it seems like he’s joining the Southside Serpents. I think that will create obvious tension with Betty, assuming he tells her. There’s a chance Jughead will be trying to live a double life, one with Betty and one with the Serpents. That is absolutely a big story we’re telling with Betty and Jughead in season two.” Sounds like trouble, but something they’ll overcome.  ANCHOR. COUPLE." False text

This “Bughead” relationship, is something to root for in 2017 at last.Everyone who ever wanted the girl next door to forgo her crush on the jock and see the sensitive guy in the corner should be jumping for joy right now.  The fact that all of the characters involved are more layered than that, and Jughead never pined or fit into a problematic “nice guy” stereotype is also great. Plus, they make a really good team — something I always look for in my favorite ‘ships. Honestly, Betty and Jughead as a simple and straightforward couple is the fantasy these days. They’re not ghosting each other via text message. They don’t hide their emotions behind a wall of fear and three levels of irony. Both of them have demons and angst like any self-respecting teen, but not when it comes to each other. We should value this kind of romantic sincerity! Keep it safe! " False link
