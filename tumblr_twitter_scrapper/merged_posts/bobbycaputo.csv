He was released from the hospital this afternoon after having his pacemaker put in yesterday. My mother was on her way to pick him up but he grew impatient and decided to start walking home. It’s about a 3.5 mile walk and it was like 95 degrees out. What the fuck man, this is why you almost fucking died because your a stubborn jerk. In the end my mom found him about 4 blocks from the hospital. She should have just let his ass walk home." True text

I figured the surgery would go well but I haven’t really mentioned it to anyone because I didn’t want to jinx it or whatever. Over the last weekend on two spectate occasions, he got really light headed and almost passed out. The second time was so bad my mother ended up bringing him to the hospital. His heart rate was hovering around 40 and his blood pressure was crazy high. He might not be the best dad but I’m glad he’s doing well. Hopefully he’ll use this experience to better himself. As it was, the whole heart problem probably was his own doing because he’s an asshole because of reasons. Aaaand especially more so since it was mentioned to him when he had back surgery last year and he just ignored the warnings, to the point he was repeatedly ignoring calls from his cardiologist. Siggghh, what an asshole. Speaking of heart conditions, another guy I know from work ended up not feeling well and went down to the ER. Fast forward 48 hours, he’s going to have a quadruple bypass tomorrow. He’s the third person in as many weeks I know that has had some sort heart surgery. Now I find out tonight that a good friend of mine is wearing a heart monitor. Apparently his issues are stress related, but still. Not cool man. Not cool." True text

There was not even a pool reporter or a pool photographer from a United States media organization allowed to step into the Oval Office for five seconds to take a photo of Trump and the Russians.  •But, hey, that’s okay because we can always count on TASS, the official Russian state news agency to cover our President’s meeting in the most important office of the “People’s House”: We ARE going to remember the names of the Republican members of Congress who aren’t raising questions, objections, or worries about what’s happening in this country, right?

Right-wing folks really love to talk about “anti-American sentiments” and “treason” until it comes to the (white) people who actually did commit treason and were anti-American in every sense of the word.   ALL OF THIS  and it was all because they wanted to keep slaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaves  Also, they didn’t fly those damned flags in the years following the Civil War, they only flew them again after the Civil Rights Act was passed.  They were literally flown to protest the abolishment of Jim Crow.   There are two appropriate places for Confederate flags: a) inside of museum displays, with accurate historical context, so that future generations don’t make the same damn mistakes b) the trash can I thought about the appropriateness of using them in Civil War Reenactments, but that particular flag wasn’t universally flown on the battlefield, and if you’re going to reenact historical battles as a hobby you should at least get the details right.  So even that’s a maybe.
