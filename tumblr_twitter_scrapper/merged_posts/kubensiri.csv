Get the information below. ■ Characters Del Sur CV: Kazuya Nakai Gender: Male Age: 34 Weapon: Sword Origin: Kingdom of Trei’kur, Planet Faykreed The brave general who leads the Trei’kur Army. He is a signeturgy swordsman who is skilled in the use of a sword, but also specializes in fire-based attacks. He is brutal and a savage, and will not hesitate to take the most vile means necessary to carry out what he must do. He does not hesitate when it comes to his vile behavior, such as taking Relia hostage. When the King’s Chosen—the group Victor belongs to—invades East Trei’kur, they do battle with Del Sur… ■ Dungeons Trei’kur Execution Tower The Trei’kur Execution Tower is an execution site northwest of East Trei’kur. In the days of old, the Trei’kur Army would execute criminals here, but today it is used as a campsite for soldiers. Before heading to the Execution Tower, the formidable foe Del Sur lies in wait. Mysterious Research Facility A vast research facility where technology was developed, and where machinery and some sort of creatures inside glass-shaped tubes filled with liquid can be seen. What kind of research was going on using these creatures? Suspiciously-dressed soldiers and machine-type enemies block the way before you. ■ System Transporter The Transporter is a system that lets you warp to any location from the Charles D. Goale warp room. Since you can return back to the Charles D. Goale by using a transmission device, you can move to faraway locations via the Charles D. Goale. ■ Battle System Advance Attack and Surprise Attack At the start of battle, if you launch a preemptive attack before you’re noticed by enemies, it’s called an “Advance Attack.” On the contrary, if you receive a preemptive attack from the enemy at the start of battle, it’s called a “Surprise Attack.” Each has its own advantages and disadvantages in status effects. —Advance Attack For a fixed period, ATK and INT increase. —Surprise Attack For a fixed period, DEF decreases. ■ Battle Miki’s Signeturgy —Explosion A fireball falls from above the enemy and causes a large explosion. The explosion wide range could result in a multiple-stage hit. —Resurrection Revive allies who have fallen on the battlefield with all of their HP. —Sunshine A multiple-stage hit attack that drops a number of light pillars from above the enemy. It also lowers the enemy’s INT. Anne’s Reserve Rush and Guard Counter —Canon Blaze (Reserve Rush) Anne flings up the enemy pulled down by the bottom of her palm and follows up with a wave of energy blasts. —Might Discharge (Guard Counter) Springs forth a ball of energy that blows enemies upward. When surrounded by enemies, you can use this to escape or as a chance to land new combos.

When carrying out an operation, he is entrusted with a very important role and always rushes in first, and while there is a side to him that is mischievous and lacks experience, he has the deep trust and high expectations of Victor’s superior officers.HanaCV: Hana TakedaGender: FemaleAge: 22Weapon: StaffOrigin Ronsack, Kingdom of Langdauq, Planet FaykreedDespite being only 22, she is one of Victor’s subordinates who belongs to the Kingdom of Resulia’s Central Resulia Army Special Forces Special Response Tactics Group. With her high signeturgy capabilities, she was also working with Fiore in the Langdauq Royal Signeturgy Research Institute. To prove her abilities, she joins the Kingdom of Resulia’s army. She is the daughter of a prestigious family and speaks in a “desu wa”-style tone. (Editor’s Note: This is women’s language that adds a feminine touch to the sentence.)DaxCV: Tokuyoshi KawashimaGender: MaleAge: 40Weapon: Bow gunOrigin: Northern Territory of Sohma, Kingdom of Resulia, Planet FaykreedBelongs to the Special Response Tactics Group in the same hometown as Victor. He’s older than Victor, but still respects him as his boss. Although one might say the accuracy of the information brought by Dax determines the success or failure of their operations, this is no exaggeration, as Dax is the team’s important intelligence member. He is a silent character who does not often speak unless necessary.■ BattleRelia’s Mysterious PowerIn battle, when Relia’s mysterious power is suddenly activated, the tides of battle can quickly change. It appears to be something like signeturgy and stops all enemies in their tracks.Ally Support SkillsIn battle, Relia can consume MP to activate support skills that enhance the status of her allies for a certain amount of time. These skills include weapon-based physical attack power-ups, physical defense power-ups, signeturgy-based mental attack power-ups, and mental defense power-ups.■ DungeonsNorthern Territory of SohmaVictor’s hometown located in the northernmost part of the Kingdom of Resulia. It had not snowed for a year here, but within two-to-three months snowfall had piled up in many areas. To the south, you can see the peaks of the snow-filled Eihied Mountains, and enjoy the tranquil and beautiful scenery. However, unlike the tropical-style life of Sthal Village, the people of Sohma live setting their wits to work as to protect themselves from the severe winter cold.Western Dakaav MineAn old, now abandoned mine that connects the Kingdom of Resulia to the Kingdom of Trei’kur. Since it was once possible to mine a variety of minerals, people from all over once gathered here and its surrounding towns prospered. Since the mine was intricately dug a long distance, the mine itself is complicated, and because it has been left alone for such a long time, there is no one that remembers a more detailed path through the tunnel. It is a place where if a single person makes the mistake of going in alone and gets lost inside, they’re at risk of losing their life.Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness is due out for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 in Japan on March 31, and for PlayStation 4 in North America and Europe in 2016.

People bury a person alive to scare them or to get rid of them. In this situation, rely only on yourself. Do not waste oxygen. In a classic coffin there’s only enough oxygen for about an hour, maybe two. Inhale deeply, exhale very slowly. Once inhaled - do not swallow, or you will start to hyperventilate. Do not light up lighters or matches, they will waste oxygen. Using a flashlight is allowed. Screaming increases anxiety, which causes increased heartbeat and therefore - waste of oxygen. So don’t scream. Shake up the lid with your hands. In some cheap low-quality coffins you will be able to even make a hole (with an engagement ring or a belt buckle.) Cross your arms over your chest, holding onto your shoulders with your hands, and pull the shirt off upward. Tie it in a knot above your head, like so: This will prevent you from suffocating when the dirt falls on your face.  Kick the lid with your legs. In some cheap coffins the lid is broken or damaged already after being buried, due to the weight of the ground above it.  As soon as the lid breaks, throw and move the dirt that falls through in the direction of your feet. When it takes up a lot of space, try pressing the ground to the sides of the coffin with your legs and feet. Move around a bit.  Whatever you do - your main goal is to sit up: dirt will fill up the empty space and move to your advantage, so no matter what - do not stop and try breathing steadily and calmly.  Get up. Remember: the dirt in the grave is very loose, so battling your way up will be easier than it seems. It’s the other way around during a rainy weather however, since water makes dirt heavy and sticky.   JUST TO PROVE TUMBLR HAS A SURVIVAL GUIDE FOR FUCKING EVERYTHING.  just in case guys " False link
