Not only that, but ‚Äúi wanted to protect you from the dark history of the paladin so that you would have a chance to bond with your lions on your own,‚Äù is literally the worst lie i have ever heard, if anything it would be easier to bond with because you‚Äôd understand their history (eg black showing shiro her history) in s2 ep 4 we have the only time a paladin asks about the previous paladins with keith asking coran if blue had a galra paladin, and before he can answer, lance interrupts. That can‚Äôt a coincidence. allura and coran are clearly hiding a lot of information from the paladins. it‚Äôs extremely shady, and i have a big feeling it‚Äôs going to blow up in their faces in a future season.

As soon as she got to the school her teacher looked at her, and with wide eyes and said You, with a Hulk doll? well that is surprising so i¬†immediately¬†stepped¬†in and asked the¬†teacher¬†to please pay¬†attention¬†during play time, because i didnt want her to have a hard time with the boys, after i picked her up the teacher told me that everything went ok. ¬†that my baby had gave the toy to the boys and went to play something else.. that¬†struck¬†me as really weird, because Nico was really exited about playing with her friend and his Capitan america. so on the way home i asked what happened They took him away and didnt let me play with them because i¬¥m a girl, they also tripped me so i fell during P.E, but i didnt see who did it.

I won‚Äôt be recording any more after this, but my name might still appear occasionally because of shoots I have said were okay to use; however I am no longer actively participating [t/n: unsure if correct]. Of course, I won‚Äôt be saying anything like¬†‚ÄúI‚Äôm making a major debut under a different name!‚Äù; I am retiring normally.  „Äê  Second thing „Äë  On August 26th, I will release one last album.At the very, very end, I would like to release a last album. The title is¬†‚ÄúShikakubatsu‚Äù. I think of it as a kind of spiritual sequel to my doujin album    ‚Äúmaru‚óãsankaku‚ñ≥‚Äù released a few years ago. As for the tracklist, I thought I would let my listeners decide from a selection of songs i have chosen, through a vote. (The truth is, there are too many songs I‚Äôd like to sing and I couldn‚Äôt decide)¬†This time, there will be two discs; one disc (Shikaku) will contain the songs my listeners and I have decided on from ‚Üë above. The second disc‚Äôs (Batsu) contents are currently a secret. Mostly, I‚Äôm thinking myself of what to put in; I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôd like to do something like an omake. Since the release date of August 26th is after my retirement, it may feel like a¬†‚Äúrelease and run away‚Äù, or rather,¬†‚Äúrun away, then release‚Äù, but, It would be nice if this CD could become something that the people buying it, and the people helping to produce it, could proudly say is a good thing. I intend to announce information on toukuten on my twitter, this Blomaga, and the following LINE@ account, so by all means please follow those accounts. Other information can be found at the special site here: http://shikakubatsu.com/  „Äê  Extra  „Äë   I started LINE@I‚Äôve started a LINE@ account entirely for album announcements.¬†http://line.me/ti/p/%40pbw7579qFor things like automatic replies, I put in a variety of nonsense things. I don‚Äôt really understand how to use this, so it might really end up turning into nonsense by the end, but‚Ä¶ If information could make its way onto the timeline that‚Äôd be nice, huh. „Äê   Additional Extra  „Äë   I‚Äôm doing a one-man official namahousouOn July 17th, I‚Äôll do an official niconico namahousou. The details have not been released yet, but when I am able to, I‚Äôll make another news post. This is more large-scale than I thought it would be, but please stay tuned~.The truth is, instead of announcing that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm retiring!‚Äù, I had been thinking of just fading out just like this, but I‚Äôve been active for so long, and gained a following of fans that was way more than I ever expected. Even now, I was able to ask the company for some help and settled some things, and thus I have announced my retirement.¬†For following me until now, thank you very much.¬†There‚Äôs about one month left, but with the inunekotenchou release event, 2G last live, and videos and namahousou, I think I will become very active for the remaining time, so I humbly thank you and look forward to your support.P.S.Perhaps people have heard this through the niconama, but I don‚Äôt have a particular reason for quitting. If I had to give a reason, it‚Äôd have to be that I feel like ‚ÄúI‚Äôve done everything I wanted to do here, huh?‚Äù. It‚Äôs just that I wanted to convey my gratitude to many different people, so I made this announcement. To have changed from being an ordinary person (Though it‚Äôs possible that that‚Äôs not the case) to being able to do activities like this, I think is all thanks to the people that have supported me until now. This time, the album¬†‚ÄúShinkakubatsu‚Äù is supposed to represent these feelings of gratitude, however, it accidentally became something I‚Äôm receiving money for. More than the cost, I‚Äôm thinking it would be nice if I could make something that everyone is happy to have, so I am so thankful for your cooperation. Truly, truly, thank you so much for everything. I have so much gratitude for everyone (of course, the company is included as well!). With about one month until I retire, and about two months until the CD is released, I humbly thank you.[t/n: I assume when he says company he‚Äôs talking about dwango, who does niconico and owns the label that‚Äôs releasing this CD? :S Sorry, I don‚Äôt follow these things very well;;]" False link
