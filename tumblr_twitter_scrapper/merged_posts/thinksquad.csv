Unpopular opinion: items in possession of large corporate entities that are used by states to compound taxation and deeply intertwined with the state, is unclaimed property. If something is the possession of “walmart” it is not owned as walmart is not a person but a legal entity created by the state to make business easier to control, and easier manage “capitalism.” Mercantilist entities that are creations of the state have no protections under the n.a.p.  The state did not create Walmart, Sam Walton did. Sam did use every legal means the state afforded to him to allow his business to succeed. Was those legal means shady, I could agree with that, but the same can be said for how the state funds to help the poor.   But your logic anarchoblake is that the money that the state gave to help the corporation is unclaimed property. This must mean that if you are poor, and the state gives you assistance, that the items you bought with it is also unclaimed property. Is WIC theft for a poor baby? The size of a business or government assistance should be no indication that theft is valid or not. Theft is theft.  If taxation is theft, then what they do with the money beyond the actual thievery, can be a discussion, but everyone within a legal border of the state, even people who believe they did not sign a social contract, fall under that jurisdiction.  As for as legality, Yes Sole Proprietor, LLC, and Corporations are fictitious entities created by the state, but those fictitious entities, are owned by individuals or groups of individuals. So yeah fuck those individuals for investing for the future.  Also I love your mental kung fu on the NAP.   The existence of the legal entity is a construct of the state and is thus meaningless.  Money is accumulated in corporate accounts separate from the companies owner’s or shareholder’s money and separate from any existent living being. This money is taxed as well as the income of all owners and employee. The existence of corporate entities aids the state by centralizing industry and compounding taxation.  This is separate from corporate welfare, and the oligarchical false alternative to monopolies. On the basis that no one owns publicly traded companies and the accumulation of capital is simply to show growth numbers in a ponzi scheme, the entire enterprise is illegitimate. If you are poor and a thief gives you stolen money without your knowledge, the money is not unclaimed. Property owned and possessed by individuals is a far cry from corporate entities. Similar in the way all property of the state is unowned property and forfeit as unclaimed, so too is the possession of government created entities. If it can’t exist without the state, it is not a legitimate creation. The victim in this case is the legal creation of the state, a non-entity. There is no victim. Your statement about borders has no bearing on this debate. Legality does not equal morality.  I am sorry I thought we were talking legality, in which the state holds all the balls, not morality. I agree legality doesn’t equal morality So this is easy. Is it moral to steal? This is an absolute. The how, why, where, or when’s are irrelevant. Those are just justifications for action. So if you believe that through mental kung fu that like your first paragraph, “The existence of the legal entity is a construct of the state and is thus meaningless.” and anything the state creates is then not protected morally. So let’s take Jessica, she is great at martial arts, she has been training all her life, well from the age of 6, and she is now in her 30′s. She decided to open a martial arts studio, but also wants to help train the next generation of fighters. So she also has weights and other equipment. She thinks about holding multiple classes, and even personal training classes. She wants this to be a legal business so her and her husband create an LLC, so her business license. So she has to get a fictitious name license, “Paper Street Soap Company” a Fight Club reference. And any other licenses she might need to make this legal. All going to the state since they hold the legality of it. Could she create a business without the state, well sure, but like most people, she loves her country, and believes this is the right thing to do. She also knows that right off the bat she is not going to probably make enough money to break even, and most companies don’t break even till their 3rd year, but she is determined. So one day, she has some students who are sparing, Let’s say they are James, and Tyrone, (Tyrone is white and James is black you racist fucks) But Tyrone’s feet were sweaty and sort of stuck to the mat when James was sweeping and broke his ankle. So everyone rushes to see what happens and gathers around. You see this as an opportunity. You decide to go into her office, where you see some of her supplements, still sealed.  A framed picture on the wall of Bruce Lee signed by Bruce himself, an expensive looking kimono hanging on the wall, and some Gi’s she must sell to her students. Oh and her purse is there too. You also see that she has her business license from the fucking state, hanging on the wall and you know if this bitch would have only created this business without the state. You would not be stealing her shit. It’s her fault. You are not responsible for this, she is. Using your words again,  “The victim in this case is the legal creation of the state, a non-entity. There is no victim.” If you’re going to misrepresent what i said and make ridiculous sculpted scenarios you can fuck right off. I never claimed it was ok to steal from a small business, the owner being jessica in your long winded little story, the property is not unclaimed. It’s jessicas. Making it theft. A clear victim can be presented with a case against you.Saying i victimized a place like bestbuy is like saying i victimized the states statutes by speeding. There is no victim to present. Did i victimize all of the workers in the collective body of bestbuy? No. They make their hourly wages all the same. The salaried members make their pay. The only thing affected by loss of corporate unowned property is the profit margin of the corporation, and in effect the amount of taxes paid off their accounts I asked was it moral to steal and you answered yes. Like I stated the how, why, where, and who are meaningless, irrelevant, and only confuse the matter. You said it was so in your mind it is. This is an absolute, is it moral to steal? It’s that simple" False text

Just as Radio lost out to the innovations of TV, TV is losing out to new media.I ask about Tumblr because as social media platforms, come and go, RIP Vine, it seems trend-wise content creators, who value free speech, or even censored speech as in SJW, have been leaving in droves. While you can still find those certain blogs, the new blood, seems very stagnate. While Verizon will be the new bearer of the Tumblr reigns, after buying Yahoo. I wonder what the future holds. I bring up Verizon because they are the new owners, and ROI is the name of the game, ROI meaning: Return on Investment, is always a factor in keeping something around. As they compete with other social media platforms, to gain new people to their platform, the platform has to innovate in order to compete. Stagnation equals death. Now with the advent of the post-truth era, many will leave platforms, because of censorship whether they feel it’s justified or not, and others will double down on the new media they are used to using. For those who hate censorship, move to Minds.com or Gab.ai people are finding new ways to express themselves. For every Facebook there is a Myspace or Friendster, so what is the future of Tumblr, the site that helped launch the Occupy Wallstreet movement, endless porn blogs, the fostering of the SJW movement, and personal fandoms. While each of those movements either died on this platform or moved on. New movements, new causes, and new blood is something that the higher ups are not attracting to this social media website, and in order for its survival to happen, new creators, new people, new innovation need to keep happening or like Vine, it too will die.  " True text

Some research into local news at Cal and what Robert Reich has posted will shed light on this (along other UC Berkeley alumni/students). The media definitely misreported it. Let’s not increase the bipartisan divide. Hate speech is hate speech and it shouldn’t take party affiliations to protest it. This is not free speech vs tolerance.     This is where you and I disagree, all speech should be free. Yes, even hate speech. As dumb and idiotic as most of it is, it should still be free to say. As Evelyn Beatrice Hall has been quoted as saying,  ""I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it"" But Thinksquad, shouldn’t I be able to yell “fire” in a crowded…Let be cut you off. That is a call to action. So no. Just like “kill ____” you can fill in the blank, but that too is a call to action. There is a difference from words and actions. You mentioned liberal agenda, I am sorry but that too is where you are wrong, this is the progressive agenda, as the liberal, and progressive agenda are two different ideologies. Liberals are very much against PC culture, liberals like Louis CK, Jerry Seinfeld, Seth MacFarlane, and the list goes on…While the progressives have stolen the college campuses, and stir the democratic ship, there is finally a civil war between the sides. Now you mentioned Robert Reich, former Clinton staffer, was in the Department of Labor for Bill Clinton, he believes that Milo hired the “anarchist” to trash the school. " True text

Goodbaudy travels without registration, without plates, without a license and without insurance.“Insurance is a scam,” he said.Knowing police will pull him over, he’s always ready with a camera. Goodbaudy posts all of his run-ins with the law on his YouTube Channel “Freedom from Government.” His videos have racked up more than 18 million views.He’s now even selling what he uses in lieu of a license plate. The tag reads “Private” -  ""Not for commerce use - private mode of travel,“ and it often gets the attention of police on the road.""If a cop comes up to me and asks me for my license, registration and insurance, I would ask him if he’s planning on using any of those against me in court,” Goodbaudy said.Because he believes in his right to travel freely, he doesn’t think he is breaking any laws and doesn’t need to prove himself to police either. Goodbaudy isn’t the only follower of this growing movement.There are thousands of people with similar beliefs all across the country who defy what most of us believe is the law and then post their confrontation online. It’s impossible to know how many like-minded people there are, however, because there’s no centralized leadership.The Southern Poverty Law Center, who would classify themselves as sovereigns, said the movement has been growing at a fast pace since 2000. Some estimates put numbers at several hundred thousand to half a million people.“I think there’s been a major awakening of consciousness, and I can’t explain why I just feel like people are finally coming out of their fog,” Goodbaudy said.You might be surprised to learn Goodbaudy isn’t anti-government, he’s just sick of government using police as a way to make a buck off him.“I feel like police have been misinformed to go out and generate revenue off the people they’re supposed to be protecting and serving,” he said.He doesn’t support building a wall, because that would represent government restricting people’s travel.“We didn’t make this land. We came here, just like anybody else would,” he said.Goodbaudy just wants to be free with what he views as his natural born rights.“As long I’m not doing any harm or causing any property damage, I should be able to do what I want,” he said. “It’s America. It’s supposed to be a free country.”" True link

WikiLeaks has been revealing one tool at the end of each week over the past two months.As noted in the documents, Athena is “a very simple implant application” that offers remote access to the target machine. The malware can be used to deliver a payload so that files can be delivered to and retrieved from a directory of the host.“The target computer operating systems are Windows XP Pro SP3 32-bit (Athena only), Windows 7 32-bit/64-bit, Windows 8.1 32- bit/64-bit, Windows 2008 Enterprise Server, Windows 2012 Server, and Windows 10,” the documents note.There’s a separate implementation of the malware called Hera, or Athena-Bravo, that supports Windows 8 to Windows 10.Athena, which is also called Athena-Alpha, gains persistence via the Windows RemoteAccess service, while Hera/Athena-Bravo uses the Dnscache service.The documents outline several ways to deliver the malware including remote installation, the supply chain, via an “asset”, or with a tool called Windex detailed in earlier WikiLeaks releases."

In an interview with Fox News before the election, Brazile denied leaking the questions to Clinton. But in a March 17, 2017, column for Time magazine, she finally admitted doing so, saying it was a “mistake I will forever regret.”A spokesman for the Rich family has repeatedly criticized detective Wheeler, who was hired by Rich’s family in March to find the DNC staffer’s murderer, for not ruling out the possibility that Rich may have leaked DNC emails to WikiLeaks. The Rich family recently sent Wheeler a “cease and desist” order to stop his investigation into the murder.As WND reported, Rich was murdered July 10, 2016, near his affluent neighborhood in Washington, D.C. He was shot in the back with a handgun at 4:18 a.m. while he walked home, and nothing was taken from him. He was transported to a local hospital and was pronounced dead at 5:57 a.m. On July 22, just 12 days after Rich’s death and days before the Democratic Party Convention in Philadelphia, WikiLeaks released 20,000 emails from DNC officials.Wheeler said in several interviews last week that a federal investigator has elaborate details about Rich’s connection to WikiLeaks and is a credible source.“I don’t like to suggest things without saying the person’s name, but I can’t say that person’s name, because that person would be thrown under the bus,” Wheeler told Fox News’ Sean Hannity. “This person, we checked him out, we have to check him out, he’s very credible – he said he laid eyes on the computer and he laid eyes on the case file.“When you look at that with the totality of everything else that I’ve found on this case, it’s very consistent for a person with my experience to begin to think, perhaps there were some email communications between Seth and WikiLeaks.”Wheeler told Hannity: “There were some problems that Seth was having on his job at the DNC right before he was killed. And the person that called the father after I called the police to get information (Brazile), that’s the person that Seth was having problems with at the DNC. So connect the dots, here; it’s starting to all come together.”Wheeler added: “I don’t know for sure, I don’t know as matter of fact, if the emails went out to WikiLeaks or anybody else. But it sure appears that way.”Brazile resigned as a contributor from CNN on Oct. 14 after it was revealed in hacked e-mails from John Podesta’s account that she leaked the questions to Clinton’s campaign before CNN-sponsored events with the candidates.“We are completely uncomfortable with what we have learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign while she was a CNN contributor,” CNN spokesperson Lauren Pratapas said in October.Trump blasted Brazile on the campaign trail for using her position at the cable news network to collude with Clinton.“Speaking of draining the swamp, Donna Brazile did it again,” Trump said just weeks before the election. “WikiLeaks today, she gave the questions to a debate to Hillary Clinton. And that was a couple of weeks ago. Happened again, but this time far worse. She gave the questions to a debate to Hillary Clinton.”" True link

And this belief can be so strong, they can sometimes follow that belief up with a false confession. Early last year, a team of lawyers and statisticians published a paper stating that 4.1 percent of criminal defendants who are sentenced to death in the US are falsely convicted. To investigate this phenomenon, a study led by psychological scientist Julia Shaw from the University of Bedfordshire in the UK investigated the possible cause, and found that, if questioned in the right way, innocent people can fabricate stories in their minds with so much detail, they can falsely convince themselves that they committed a crime. “Our findings show that false memories of committing crime with police contact can be surprisingly easy to generate, and can have all the same kinds of complex details as real memories,” Shaw said in a press release. “All participants need to generate a richly detailed false memory is three hours in a friendly interview environment, where the interviewer introduces a few wrong details and uses poor memory-retrieval techniques.” … " False link

Other Founders would say July 4th, the day that is currently recognized as a federal holiday by our national government. And still other Founders would say, “what Independence Day?” since the holiday wasn’t widely celebrated until many of the Founders had passed away.Here is the evidence, so you can decide which Independence Day is really Independence Day!Officially, the Continental Congress declared its freedom from Britain on July 2, 1776, when it approved a resolution and delegates from New York were given permission to make it a unanimous vote.John Adams thought July 2 would be marked as a national holiday for generations to come.“The most memorable Epocha, in the History of America. I am apt to believe that it will be celebrated, by succeeding Generations, as the great anniversary Festival… It ought to be solemnized with Pomp and Parade with shews, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this continent to the other from this Time forward forever more,” Adams said about what he envisioned as a July 2nd national holiday.After voting on independence on July 2, the Continental Congress needed to draft a document explaining the move to the public. It had been proposed in draft form by the Committee of Five (John Adams, Roger Sherman, Robert Livingston, Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson) and it took two days for the Congress to agree on the edits.Once the Congress approved the actual Declaration on Independence document on July 4, it ordered that it be sent to a printer named John Dunlap. About 200 copies of the Dunlap Broadside were printed, with John Hancock’s name printed at the bottom. Today, 26 copies remain.That is why the Declaration has the words, “IN CONGRESS, July 4, 1776,” at its top, because that is the day the approved last version was signed in Philadelphia.On July 8, 1776, Colonel John Nixon of Philadelphia read a printed Declaration of Independence to the public for the first time on what is now called Independence Square.(Most of the members of the Continental Congress signed a version of the Declaration on August 2, 1776 in Philadelphia. The names of the signers were released publicly in early 1777. So that famous painting showing the signing of the Declaration on July 4, 1776 is a bit of an exaggeration.)The late historian Pauline Maier said in her 1997 book about the Declaration that no member of Congress recalled in early July 1777 that it was almost a year since they declared their freedom from the British. They finally remembered the event on July 3, 1777, and July 4th became the day that seemed to make sense for celebrating independence.Maier also said that the Declaration (and celebrating its signing) was stuck in an early feud between the Federalists (of John Adams) and the Republicans (of Thomas Jefferson).  The Declaration and its anniversary day weren’t widely celebrated until the Federalists faded away from the political scene after 1812.In 1870, Independence Day was made an unpaid holiday for federal employees. In 1941, Congress made it a paid holiday for them.In the last letter he ever wrote, Thomas Jefferson spoke in 1826 of the importance of the day. “For ourselves, let the annual return of this day forever refresh our recollections of these rights, and an undiminished devotion to them,” he said.Two days later, Jefferson and Adams both passed away on the Fourth of July."
