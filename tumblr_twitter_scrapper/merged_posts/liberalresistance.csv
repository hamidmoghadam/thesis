It may prove instructive. After the break-in at the Democratic National Committee Headquarters, which was housed in the Watergate office building near the Lincoln Memorial, in June 1972, a vigorous, multi-pronged investigation of the break-in and related issues began. Reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward of the Washington Post took one prong; the Department of Justice took another, and Congress took a third. (Recent references to the “Saturday Night Massacre” refer to Nixon’s efforts to forestall the Justice Department’s probe by firing the special investigator looking into Watergate. The other two probes were unaffected.) For over two years, Republicans in Congress mounted a vigorous defense of Nixon despite being the minority party in both the House and the Senate. They supported Nixon as the tapes came out, as the stories of “the plumbers” emerged, as the general vileness of the Nixon administration was revealed. (Nixon was a racist, an ethnic and religious bigot, a paranoid and a drunk, so it was quite a scene.) Finally, however, in late July 1974, a tape emerged in which Nixon was heard to order the head of the CIA to contact the head of the FBI and inform the FBI that Watergate was a matter of national security and so the FBI should abandon its investigation. This tape, which had been made in June 1972, became the so-called “smoking gun” that proved Nixon had obstructed justice.  Once the smoking gun tape was released, a delegation of senior Congressional Republicans, most of whom had been defending him, went to the White House and told Nixon that if he did not resign, he would be impeached by the House of Representatives, and then would be convicted by the Senate. Nixon mulled it over and announced his resignation in a televised speech on August 8, 1974. He left office at noon the next day. And was promptly pardoned by President Ford for any crimes he (Nixon) committed or may have committed while President. (There were allegations of tax fraud, too, that never got explored.) The takeaway? When the Republicans start going to the White House, it’s game over for Trump. Until then? We all wonder: what the fuck is going on? What does it take? " False text

liberalresistance 160678803425 "2017-05-15 01:55:36 GMT" https://liberalresistance.tumblr.com/post/160678803425/the-end-of-trump "robertreich:  The question is no longer whether there are grounds to impeach Donald Trump. It is when enough Republicans will put their loyalty to America ahead of their loyalty to their party.  Trump’s statements last week about his firing of former FBI director James Comey provide ample evidence that Trump engaged in an obstruction of justice – a major charge in impeachment proceedings brought against Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton. It’s worth recalling that the illegality underlying Nixon’s impeachment was a burglary at the Watergate complex, while the illegality underlying Clinton’s was lying to a grand jury about sex with an intern in the White House. Trump’s obstruction is potentially far more serious. It involves an investigation about whether Trump or his aides colluded with Russia in rigging a presidential election – the most direct assault on American democracy in history, Last Thursday, in an interview with NBC News’s Lester Holt about his firing of Comey, Trump said: “I was going to fire regardless of recommendation.” Trump also said that he had pressed Comey during a private dinner to tell him if he was under investigation. Trump conceded that the ongoing investigation into Russian influence on the 2016 election, which includes a probe into the possibility that Moscow was coordinating with the Trump campaign, was one of the factors Trump considered before firing Comey. “In fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, ‘You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, it’s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won,’ ” Trump said. The law is reasonably clear. If Trump removed Comey to avoid being investigated, that’s an obstruction of justice – an impeachable offense.  On Friday, Trump tweeted that Comey “better hope that there are no ‘tapes’ of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!” Here, the law is also clear. Seeking to silence, intimidate or even influence someone who is likely to offer evidence in a congressional or criminal proceeding is also an obstruction of justice – and an impeachable offense. As a practical matter, though, nothing will happen until a majority of the House decides on bringing a bill of impeachment. Which means, under the present congress, twenty-two Republicans would have to join with House Democrats to put enough pressure on the Speaker of the House to allow such a bill to be considered. The odds of this occurring in this Congress, under present circumstances, are approximately zero. So – barring a “smoking gun” that shows Trump’s complicity with Russian operatives in interfering in the 2016 election – Trump’s fate seems to hinge on the midterm elections of 2018. Those elections are less than eighteen months away. That’s a long time in American politics. Under a Trump presidency, that’s an eternity. But there’s another possibility. In my experience, most elected politicians have two goals – to do what they consider to be the right things for the American public, and to be reelected (not necessarily in that order). If Trump’s poll numbers continue to plummet – particularly among Republicans and Independents – twenty-two House Republicans may well decide their chances for being reelected are better if they abandon him before the 2018 midterms. Paul Ryan and the House Republican leadership might make a similar calculation, at least enough to put a bill of impeachment on the table. Most House Republicans prefer Vice President Mike Pence to Donald Trump anyway. As one said to me several months ago, “Pence is a predictable conservative. Trump is an unpredictable egomaniac. Most of us are more comfortable with the former.” There’s a good chance Trump’s polls will continue to fall. First, he’s shown to be his own worst enemy. Even when things are going reasonably well, he seems bizarrely intent on stirring controversy – and saying or tweeting things that get him into trouble. There’s also a matter of the economy. The expansion that began in 2009 is getting long in the tooth. If history is any guide, we’re due for a slowdown or recession. And justified or not, presidents get blamed when Americans lose jobs. Donald Trump doesn’t have the character or the temperament to be president of the United States. But this obvious fact isn’t enough to get him fired. He’ll be fired when enough Americans decide they can’t abide him anymore. Then, maybe in an impeachment proceeding, it will come out that Trump did something incredibly stupid – like give a nod of approval to one of his campaign bottom feeders like Roger Stone to tell a Russian operative to go ahead with their plan to interfere in the 2016 election. The House impeaches. The Senate convicts. That’s the end of Trump.  " False text

Here’s What the Bill Actually Does, and How to Fight Back. On May 4, the U.S. House voted to pass the worst bill for women’s health in a generation: the American Health Care Act (AHCA). This bill not only seeks to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA), but also to “defund” Planned Parenthood by blocking Medicaid patients from care at its health centers.  As the bill heads to the Senate, here’s what it actually does — and what it doesn’t do. What Thursday’s Vote Did NOT Do  It didn’t become law.The ACA repeal bill passed the House by a narrow margin, and now it faces an uphill battle in the Senate. We can expect more changes to the bill that will impact women’s health.  It didn’t close Planned Parenthood.All Planned Parenthood health centers are open as usual, and staff are doing what they’ve always done: getting up in the morning; opening the health center doors; and providing high-quality, affordable health care to all people who need it. That includes patients who rely on Medicaid coverage.  It didn’t cancel your insurance.The benefits of the ACA are still here for you, even if you’re 26 or younger and on your parents’ plan. In fact, the majority of people can still purchase a plan for $75 or less. If you have health care coverage, it is still in effect until there is an actual change in the law, which takes time. So, make your medical appointments, and get the care you deserve and are entitled to under the law. What the AHCA Threatens to Do to Women’s Health In particular, the AHCA would: Take away health coverage for 24 million people  “Defund” Planned Parenthood by blocking people who rely on Medicaid from accessing preventive care at its health centers — including birth control, cancer screenings, and STD testing and treatment Reduce access to no-cost preventive services, including birth control End protections that keep insurers from charging people with pre-existing conditions unaffordable rates — allowing insurance companies to once again charge people tens of thousands of dollars a month because they had cancer Impose a nationwide ban on private insurance coverage of abortion  Undermine Essential Health Benefits — including maternity coverage and prescription drugs, which disproportionately affect women.  Gut the Medicaid program, which approximately 1 in 4 women of reproductive age rely on to access no-cost, critical reproductive health care (such as birth control, lifesaving cancer screenings, and maternity care) 4 Ways to Fight Back Now Infuriated? You’re not alone. Here are the top three ways to stand up for health care and stand with Planned Parenthood right now. #1: Call Your SenatorsThis is the most important way to take action right now. Use our easy online form to call your U.S. senators. We’ll give you a script so you can tell them to protect health care and stand with Planned Parenthood. #2: Tag Your Senators on FacebookDo you notice when somebody tags you on Facebook? Chances are,  your answer is “yes” — and that goes for your senators, too. Our simple form automatically tags your senators and gives you time to edit the post. #3: Tweet at Your SenatorsIf you have Twitter, take a moment to tweet at your senators. Our easy-to-use form automatically finds your senators’ handles. It also gives you a sample tweet if you don’t want to write your own. #4: Tweet at Reps who Voted Against Women’s HealthClick on the link above and scroll own for our list of representatives who voted in favor of this dangerous bill. If you see your House member, tell them you will not forget that they stripped access to care — and will not forgive. " False text

Of course, high drama, romance and scandal will be a huge part of the proceedings. This show is going to be a must-watch when it premieres on May 29, and not just for the Shondaland factor. If you’re anything like me, you’re probably a huge costume or historical drama fan. I love seeing all the trappings of a good soap opera played out in sumptuous clothes and beautiful surroundings. It’s escapist entertainment at its best and most fashionable. From my time on the internet, there have been many Twitter live tweets of PBS’ historical dramas, from Downton Abbey to Granchester, led by Black women. Yet, the historical drama genre frequently leaves Black women and other women of color out of the storyline. Instead, many marginalized communities are forced to align themselves with stories that view them as either on the outskirts of society or removed from society altogether. Films based on the works of Jane Austen come to mind, seeing how we’re in the age of racebending, it’d be really interesting to see how a director or screenwriter would interpret Pride and Prejudice with a non-White Elizabeth. It would add another level of nuance, possibly, and it would also provide non-White audience members an outlet to finally see someone they can identify with on a more personal level in the genre they love. On the other hand, instead of racebending every costume drama character, it would be great if studios didn’t whitewash the characters of color who are in these classic stories. Take Wuthering Heights for instance. The character of Heathcliff isn’t White like he’s been portrayed in the movies. Instead, he’s described as a lascar, which is an antiquated term referring to Indian sailors. Also, further description provided by Emily Brontë—which includes a now-offensive term—could also mean Heathcliff is of the Roma people, who did originate from India and went on to migrate to other parts of the world. In any event, he’s not White. However, he’s routinely played by White actors, at least until the 2011 indie adaptation of Wuthering Heights, which starred then-unknown actor James Howson as Heathcliff. Another example of keeping non-White characters’ racial integrity intact would be The Count of Monte Cristo. The book itself is written by Alexandre Dumas, a Black French author. Incidentally, it should be said that Cary Fukunaga and John Legend are currently working on adapting the book The Black Count: Glory, Revolution, Betrayal, And The Real Count of Monte Cristo, into a film. The book is about Dumas’ father and inspiration for Edmond Dantès—the main character in The Count of Monte Cristo—French Revolution-era general Thomas-Alexandre Dumas. With that inspiration in mind, wouldn’t it have been great to have the many film adaptations of The Count of Monte Cristo actually respect Dumas’ original vision? The lack of Black and non-White characters in prominent roles in historical fiction has led too many viewers and creators to believe that it’s not historically accurate to have non-White characters as lords and ladies of the manor. Instead, non-White characters are relegated to either slave and servant roles or roles depicting the poor. That’s not to say that those roles are invalid, but there was more to Europe’s population of color than just existing as laborers for White society. There were royal musicians, military elite and indeed, queens. Furthermore, Europe has been a multicultural society for as long as there have been people in existence, so the idea that Europe was at one point a safe haven for pure Whiteness is a dangerous and limiting falsehood. This brings me back to Still Star-Crossed. It’s high time we as Black women have more than just Belle, the story of Black English aristocrat Dido Elizabeth Belle, to hang our hats on. We need to have a variety of images of Black women in historical European society, and Still Star-Crossed is helping carry the load Belle has had to carry all by itself. There will be no finer day in Shondaland than when I’ll be able to sit down with my various TV-viewing snacks and watch the premiere episode of Still Star-Crossed, excited to see a dark-skinned Black woman and her family ooze regality on my screen. The fact that audiences across America will see the same thing will be icing on the cake; finally, everyone will have the opportunity to realize that yes, Black women were everywhere, even 1300s Italy.

For Hernandez, the mural is a statement on the vitality of the changing neighborhood, one that’s often depicted as a place in which tensions between Puerto Rican and Mexican residents are described as tense and hostile."

Imagine having to face every single day knowing that your son was murdered. Imagine you have no answers — that no one has been brought to justice and there are few clues leading to the killer or killers. Imagine that every single day, with every phone call you hope that it’s the police, calling to tell you that there has been a break in the case. Imagine that instead, every call that comes in is a reporter asking what you think of a series of lies or conspiracies about the death. That nightmare is what our family goes through every day. Our beloved son Seth Rich was gunned down in the early hours of July 10, 2016, in his Washington, D.C., neighborhood of Bloomingdale. On the day he was murdered, Seth was excited about a new job he had been offered on Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign… [Right-wing] news outlets and commentators continue, day after painful day, to peddle discredited conspiracy theories that Seth was killed after having provided WikiLeaks with emails from the DNC. Those theories, which some reporters have since retracted, are baseless, and they are unspeakably cruel. We know that Seth’s personal email and his personal computer were both inspected by detectives early in the investigation and that the inspection revealed no evidence of any communications with anyone at WikiLeaks or anyone associated with WikiLeaks. Nor did that inspection reveal any evidence that Seth had leaked DNC emails to WikiLeaks or to anyone else. Indeed, those who have suggested that Seth’s role as a data analyst at the DNC gave him access to a wide trove of emails are simply incorrect — Seth’s job was to develop analytical models to encourage voters to turn out to vote. He didn’t have access to DNC emails, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee emails, John Podesta’s emails or Hillary Clinton’s emails. That simply wasn’t his job. Despite these facts, our family’s nightmare persists. Seth’s death has been turned into a political football.  Right-wingers are not human beings and we need to stop treating them as such.

The justices ruled Monday that Republicans who controlled the state legislature and governor’s office in 2011 placed too many African-Americans in the two districts. The result was to weaken African-American voting strength elsewhere in North Carolina. Both districts have since been redrawn and the state conducted elections under the new congressional map in 2016. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
