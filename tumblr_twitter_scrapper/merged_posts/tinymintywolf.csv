I am so sorry for this delay and I will do my best to get them assembled, packaged, and shipped out ASAP. I will email customers who pre-ordered with an estimate of shipping times once i have worked out details with my alternative supplier, as soon as I get back from Ba-Con this weekend.This situation is extremely frustrating for me and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. I‚Äôll be including a free mini print with all pre-orders that were placed as a bonus, and as thanks for everyone‚Äôs patience. " True text
