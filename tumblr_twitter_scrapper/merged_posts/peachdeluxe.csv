Jackson told reporters that Brown and a friend were in fact stopped, “because they were walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic.” He also admitted that Darren Wilson, the officer who killed Brown, didn’t suspect Brown at the time that he stopped him. When Chief Jackson was asked by reporters why his department chose to release the robbery tape if it was unrelated to the shooting, he replied that he had to because “the media asked for it.” " False link
