Very strong and ambitious without giving in to greed. Lost his sanity for a bit but sheer willpower brought it back, and mopped 0 seconds about it, went straight back to decimating ass in the name of justice and to save many numerous dames (honestly, if there was a dame in danger, this guy and his lion pal popped up immediately). Batman if his motif was the lion and also if Albert was a lion. Notable Feat: One of his adventures had him disenchant a cursed maiden who had been turned into a dragon by kissing her three times. That’s right, folks, Sir Ywain smooched dragon girls for reals and you’ll never achieve the heights of his glory.  Sir Percival the Grail Knight: Exceedingly powerful yet never once lorded his immense strength over anyone, and in fact, his impossibly humble nature actually had him act in ways to make others around him seem cooler, even though he was extremely capable. Clad in only a silk dress, Percival once threw a fully armored and armed knight over a castle wall, and this other time, clad in only shitty tin “armor” he made from pots, dddddestroyed an Evil Knight Of Certain Renown and stole his armor. The armor of pots happened because a merchant pulled a fast one over him (he traded his extremely expensive silk and gold-weave dress for a cart of junk), and then defended the man that fucked him over when the town was about to lynch him. Notable Feat: Defeated Sir Lancelot of the Lake (yes, that Lancelot) in fair and single combat, and kept disarming him instead of injuring him. Even then, he kept claiming “oh no, he won, I was just lucky, I am pretty sure he had the advantage” so as to not sully the hero’s name. Oh, yeah, and, you know, he fucking achieved the Holy Grail.  Sir Gawain: Dayman, Fighter of the Nightman, Champion of the Sun, You Are A Master of Karate, And Friendship For Everyone. Good man, very strong, was kind of a dumbass, but that adds to the charm. He’s the kind muscleman that spots for your scrawny ass in the gym your first time and tells you how to do the exercises properly. Most likely to become a good friend in the long term. Notable Feat: His whole fucking life, man. The code of chivalry didn’t actually apply to peasantry, as in, knights were not required to protect peasants at all, yet Gawain was known as the Defender of the Poor. What a fucking stud.  Galahad Tier:  Sir Galahad of Twilight: Galahad gets his own tier because he’s like some sort of Mary Sue that came outta nowhere in late transcriptions of Arthurian Mythos and sort of just was the best at everything ever in any context, which is funny because his father, Sir Lancelot, was more or less the same but actually likable (as in, Lancelot was not part of the original Old Welsh scriptures, and was basically really cool but also had a lot of flaws to his badassery, whereas Galahad is kinda just perfect). However, his divine protection does not allow me to put him at the bottom, for forces that dwarf my comprehension keep moving him up here. Notable Feat: Being a self-insert OC that got accepted in the canon.Chivalrous Tier:  Sir Lancelot of the Lake: Goku, but lecherous. Notable Feat: Goku, but lecherous.  Sir Bedivere of the Perfect Sinews: The world’s first slot machine. Went on a ridiculous numbers of adventures in the early game, some of them even with Arthur’s dog, Cavall, and despite having only one arm, m dude was basically a Dynasty Warriors character. Openly practiced witchcraft, which almost got him hanged a couple of times, if it hadn’t been for Arthur’s interference and testimonies to his legitimately good character. Notable Feat: With Cavall the Dog, went on an adventure to kill an Evil Magical Boar and steal its comb, before hitting the boar so hard it fell right into the ocean and drowned, because Bedivere Don’t Fuck Around.  Sir Bors the Younger: Never on schedule, but always on time. Sir Bors wasn’t a superhuman like some of his peers, but his strong point was his virtue and how hard he adhered to the Code of Chivalry, which is more that can be said for a lot of knights, even in higher tiers. A hot young maiden once told him “FUCK WITH ME OR I WILL KILL MYSELF” but he refuse because he wouldn’t break his Vow of Celibacy. The girl, of course, turned out to be a DEMON that tried to trick him. Then, another time, his brother, Sir Lionel, was getting whipped by a notched whip by an assailant while a young girl was being kidnapped by a rogue knight. Notable Feat: He chose to save the young girl over his brother. His brother was Kinda Pissed, so he came back to murder Bors for abandoning him, and Bors didn’t defend himself, saying “yeah I understand why you are angry, honestly”. God himself saves Bors by striking down Lionel with a pillar of fire. Bors then went to be one of the three knights to achieve the Holy Grail (the other two being Percival and Galahad)  Sir Tristan (Or “Tristram” for you historians): Not only was Mister Sadman a capable fighter, Tristan also played instruments and sang, and he was said have a very beautiful voice. The beauty behind Tristan is that he went through multiple trials and tribulations that tested his worth as a person and as a Knight truly (as in, someone who pursues the path of chivalry) rather than his martial might. Notable Feat: Accidentally consumes a love potion with Iseult, who was on her way to marry someone, and he still held onto his reigns as a knight without betraying either chivalry or her love too much. Manure Tier:  King Arthur: cuck. Notable Feat: His knights all went on way more exciting adventures than him and his peak is when he gets shanked by his illegitimate son and shanks him back and then spends like fourteen hours bitching at Bedivere for him to go drop his sword in a lake."

Someone asked on a post a while ago who Donald’s sister is. Short crash course if you don’t know anything about Disney Ducks; She has different names depending on which country’s comics you are reading, but in english her name is usually ‘Della’ while in the Europe she’s generally called ‘Dumbella’. She and Donald are twins. Della is Huey Dewey and Louis’ mom.  Long story short, she eventually couldn’t cope with the triplets any more after they set off a firecracker under their father’s chair and put him in hospital, so she effectively dumped them on Donald because “I can’t handle them any more. You take them for a while.” If you think that’s messed up I’ll also add that Donald and his sister were not on speaking terms at this time (and remain so. Donald is also not on speaking terms with his parents). After this, Della disappears from the picture. There’s been some problems by the comic writer’s trying to decide what to do but it is generally been decided not to elaborate on where Della is, because there is really only 2 answers. The first (and more likely) being that she just abandoned the triplets after leaving them with Donald. And the second is that she and her husband met with some accident which is why they never came back. The writers of most Disney comics decided both answers are too depressing to really explore when dealing with children, so they’ve never properly answered the question. So that’s who Donald’s sister is.  What  Fucking Donald Duck lore, man.  This is nearly as depressing as the realization Goofy is a single father because his wife is presumably dead. " False text

Doctor finds anecdotal evidence that people are passing kidney stones after riding on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad at Disney World 2.

When they were in the front, the passage rate was only 16.67 percent. That’s based on only 60 rides on a single coaster, and Wartinger guards his excitement in the journal article: ‘Preliminary study findings support the anecdotal evidence that a ride on a moderate-intensity roller coaster could benefit some patients with small kidney stones.’” 4. “Some rides are going to be more advantageous for some patients than other rides. So I wouldn’t say that the only ride that helps you pass stones is Big Thunder Mountain. That’s grossly inaccurate.” 5. “His advice for now: If you know you have a stone that’s smaller than five millimeters, riding a series of roller coasters could help you pass that stone before it gets to an obstructive size and either causes debilitating colic or requires a $10,000 procedure to try and break it up. And even once a stone is broken up using shock waves, tiny fragments and “dust” remain that need to be passed. The coaster could help with that, too.” SCIENCE: IT WORKS  Update:  “In all, we used 174 kidney stones of varying shapes, sizes and weights to see if each model worked on the same ride and on two other roller coasters,” Wartinger said. “Big Thunder Mountain was the only one that worked. We tried Space Mountain and Aerosmith’s Rock ‘n’ Roller Coaster and both failed.”Wartinger went on to explain that these other rides are too fast and too violent with a G-force that pins the stone into the kidney and doesn’t allow it to pass.“The ideal coaster is rough and quick with some twists and turns, but no upside down or inverted movements,” he said.

Today, Squanchtendo (yes, that’s their actual name) announces their first project: a game called Accounting, which Roiland is designing in collaboration with The Stanley Parable designer William Pugh. “William lied to me and said he worked at [Titanfall 2 developer] Respawn,” Roiland told Polygon at PAX West earlier this month. “I was in the building where Respawn’s offices were, and I wanted a tour. I was like, ‘Oh my god, maybe if I tweet, somebody [at Respawn] will see it and give me a tour.’” There was only one problem with this: William Pugh doesn’t work at Respawn. William Pugh has never worked at Respawn. Willliam Pugh doesn’t even work in the same country as Respawn. Currently, William Pugh directs his own small game studio called Crows Crows Crows, built to create experimental games like Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and The Terribly Cursed Emerald: A Whirlwind Heist, which it released for free last year. “I immediately followed him, and I direct messaged him, and I’m like, ‘Oh my god, I’m right here! I’m like in the lobby!’” said Roiland. “And he’s like “Listen, I don’t … I’m so sorry, I don’t actually work at Respawn. But I’m a huge fan of Rick and Morty.” “I found out who he was, and I had already played and loved The Stanley Parable, so I was like, ‘Oh my god! Dude, I’m a huge fan!’” said Roiland. “And it was like this … weird switcheroonie, y'know, like, ‘I don’t work at Respawn, but I made this game.’” The rest is history. After their chance Twitter meeting, Pugh and Roiland flew out to Los Angeles and spent a week jamming out a game idea: prototyping it, recording all the dialogue, and running back and forth between them to implement it. The result: Accounting, a surreal, laugh-out-loud HTC Vive game that sees you putting on a VR mask and exploring surreal, unpredictable room-scale worlds, most of which consist of Roiland and Pugh screaming hilarious improvised dialogue at you. You’ll later find another VR headset within that world and then go one layer deeper to begin the cycle anew. Accounting is coming ‘very soon,’ Squanchtendo says on the game’s website, and it will be available as a free download from Steam.” " False link

Well, there is one now. About time. “Chiune Sugihara was a Japanese diplomat who was stationed at a consulate in Kaunas, Lithuania during the early days of World War II. Between July 31 and August 28, 1940, Sugihara and his wife spent long nights writing and issuing more than 2,000 visas for Jewish refugees desperate to flee the Nazis and build new lives in Japan – even though his actions defied the Japanese government’s orders. “ " False link

He looked like a little tiger cub. Visitors have always said that he is very, very similar to a tiger cub. Ten days ago, he disappeared. We all thought that he would reappear, since he is very attached to the children and loves to play with them and go out with them in the yard. But now we have begun to seriously worry. Perhaps he is with someone nearby. That person may not know how to find the owners. I am sure that no one needs someone else’s cat. Therefore, we would be grateful for any information. Thanks in advance.” we truly live in the shitpost timeline " False link
