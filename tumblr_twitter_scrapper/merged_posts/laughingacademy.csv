It was very good.  It was made into  a stage play. That was very good.   Then Motion Pictures became a thing and there was an adaptation of Dracula made in Germany. But it wasn’t authorized so the names were all changed and the vampire wasn’t called Dracula.  He was Orlock. This didn’t save him from a fate worse than sunlight, legal problems. So, he doesn’t really Count (hee hee). In 1931, there was an official version made, but it was based on the stage production more than the book so a lot of characters were left out. It was a big hit!  So, Universal Pictures made more films.  However, they killed off Dracula in the first one so for the sequel, they had his Daughter! The movie was good but it had… problems.   So they tried again with Son of Dracula who wasn’t his Son but Dracula himself, sort of, maybe.  He was played by the Wolf Man. Then Dracula got to meet The Wolf Man, Frankenstein and some Mad Scientists… Twice.  He was played by someone else again. Oh and then he met Abbott and Costello and was played by the first guy again! Then there was no Dracula for a while.  Until 1958 when some enterprising chaps in England decided to make a new version.  It was in  And it starred Grand Moff Tarkin and Saruman! It was a big hit and they made a bunch more Dracula films!   And this will be continued… " False text

I almost forgot what it was like to be able to wear a sweater or be physically close to a human being for more than one minute without everyone stewing to death in each other’s sweat. Whenever someone here in Iowa catches that we moved from Florida, there’s always remarks about how “lucky” we were to be there, how “crazy” we were to leave it, or how terrible it must be to experience a winter. These are people who have likely never been to Florida, and probably think Florida looks like this: When most of Florida actually looks like either this: Or this: Florida was built mostly on what used to be swampland, which was drained and filled in with imported soil and gravel until houses could be built on it. This means that most of where you go in Florida, the ground itself is basically fake, and it looks the part. It’s flat as a pancake, there are perfect, straight drainage ditches instead of rivers or streams and the hills are blocky, artificial things wealthy people have on their properties to keep their shit above flood level.It is not pretty enough to compensate for its climate. Now, you probably think you know what being “too hot” is like. Maybe you live in Australia or Nevada or something and you’ve been able to fry eggs on the sidewalk. Yeah, nasty. Like living in an oven, right? Your NICE, DRY fucking oven. Florida spends most of the year in the high 80′s at a minimum, the sky is usually cloudless, buildings are built low to the ground and the trees are either palms or scrappy little things offering next to zero shade. The sun is perpetually baking every single surface, to the point that a freshly paved road goes from black to chalky white within weeks. In fact, EVERYTHING outdoors is steadily bleached chalky white. You better love pastels because no matter what you paint your house or decorate your lawn with, it’s going to become pastel. Pastel with streaks of piss yellow.   NORMALLY, an environment like this is also associated with dryness, but Florida is not normal. In Florida, there is almost no reprieve from the humidity. Not in its coolest “winters,” and not indoors with any level of climate control. You can never get rid of mold in your house. You can never stop feeling greasy. Often it’s so moist outside that breathing is physically difficult. Again, you’ve probably experienced this, but there aren’t too many places, at least in America, where you’re stuck with it some 330 days of the year. And moisture, as you may know, traps additional heat, so when they say Florida is 90 degrees Fahrenheit, that’s the ambient temperature, in the open air. You aren’t air. You are a solid mass that produces body heat and moisture of its own, and you’re legally required to wear some amount of clothing when you step outside. The air may be 90 degrees, but you are going to feel about 120 degrees, and it’s probably going to just steadily get worse until your next opportunity to shower or stand directly in front of an air conditioner for a while. So Florida combines the blistering sun of Death Valley with the moisture of the Amazon Basin, without looking as nice as either of those places. It’s like they had a baby but they’re two different species so the baby is some freakish sterile donkey monster. That’s Florida. It’s the abominable mule of a rainforest and a desert. And we haven’t even gotten to THE SMELL yet! Do you realize what it smells like when an entire state is both too wet and too hot ALL the god damned time? When there is never any cool, dry period long enough to clear the air of the collective funk of every possible surface being slowly, perpetually broiled? Think of how much plastic and rubber is lying around one city. Have you smelled burning plastic and rubber? Now think about how much garbage is lying around in one city. The garbage in the streets, in the cans outside every business, in the cans on the lawns of several million households, all both too hot and too wet. All the time. Next, factor in the usual level of air pollution when you’ve got a dense population, made denser by the number of people vacationing there and visiting their elderly family memmbers all year round. Good god, the traffic. On top of the car exhaust fumes hanging around in the wet air, you’ve got the collective odor of the people themselves, since everyone is constantly pouring sweat and can’t possibly afford enough showers to keep up with the stink. Add to that the fact that, despite the wetness, you are never more than a couple miles from something on fire. Sometimes acres and acres of Florida scrubland are on fire. You’ll hear fire trucks multiple times a day no matter where you are, but we’re not here to talk about the noise pollution, which would make this post go on even longer - as would any talk of its equally godawful political and cultural environment.You’re also never very far from either a beach, brackish river or estuary, of course, and that means you can top off the miasma of bleaching plastic, ash, sweat, body odor, sunscreen, smog and roasting garbage with a whiff of decomposing fish every now and then, like someone quietly hitting a triangle to add one more note to a never-ending song about ass. And to cut this nice and short, let me wrap up with two magical words every single Floridian will know intimately well sooner or later in their reeking, roasting stew of a state: FUNGAL. INFECTIONS.  So if you’re still living miserable in Florida, or miserable just about anywhere, you can skip this update. I don’t want anybody to feel bad, I just gotta get this out of my own system. When I wrote this post, we lived in Iowa - only very marginally (almost not at all actually) better than Florida -  as a temporary stepping stone to where we really wanted to be, the Pacific Northwest, and now we’ve lived in Oregon for about eight months, really due entirely to someone sweet enough to trust us total strangers as last-minute replacement roommates.. We never made more than the equivalent of minimum wage but it honestly came down to either moving out here or possibly actually dying from exacerbated depression.  It may occur to you that it’s almost impossible to be any farther from Florida on this continent.  Here’s a visual for you: So, here are some things about where we live now: The sun spends more than 50% of days hidden completely behind a sky of grey clouds. Good. The only downside is that it isn’t 90% of days. We have had enough sun for ten lifetimes and the sun can die in a ditch forever.  It rains several times a week all year round. Good. The rain keeps everything looking and smelling clean and fresh and we have NO allergies out here. Never in my life have I needed so few tissues or pills.   Everything is green. Vibrant, emerald green, even at the peak of winter because even when all the leaves have fallen the trees are still coated in several inches of moss and lichen. Vast areas even have moss instead of grass, and where there is grass, it’s soft and plush and you do not get stung by fire ants if you sit on it. We live by a river and have never smelled decaying fish at all. I think most of the fish are actually even alive at a given time????  I’ve never seen a pro-Trump sign around Portland.  Even in 70-80 degree weather, which comes by for maybe a couple months out of the year, there are scattered cold fronts and even precious little baby hail storms blowing in off the surrounding mountains, or you can drive an hour up those mountains to see some snow drifts. I have like some weird sort of survivor’s guilt being here, like I can’t shake the sense that I can’t possibly deserve to be here more than other people who have to be in Florida, but it turns out a lot of people who always lived here don’t even like it. They don’t even like any of the things I just said. They would RATHER be somewhere like Florida. Everybody’s different I guess and that’s cool and okay but if I were a billionaire I’d just set up an exchange program so all these fuckin weirdos can go ahead to Florida and those of you stuck in Florida can take over their apartments. I would get you all out of Florida if I could.  THIS IS WHY I LIVE IN SEATTLE. I LIVED IN FUCKING FLORIDA FOR TWENTY FUCKING YEARS. NEXT YEAR I WILL HAVE FINALLY SPENT HALF MY LIFE OUTSIDE OF FLORIDA, AND I WILL THROW A FUCKING PARTY.  I lived in Florida for several years, myself. This?^^ ONLY covers the climate and general ambience of the place; please also understand there is 1. no education, and 2. no laws. People think I’m being ridiculous when I say this, but please understand. You don’t have to get your car inspected OR USE YOUR TURN SIGNAL. It’s perfectly LEGAL to threaten your neighbor’s children with a loaded gun if you feel like it, and you can in fact shoot them if they’re actually ON your property. And by “no education”, well…let’s see. I remember quite vividly spending five minutes trying to explain to my supervisor at one workplace what “syllables” are, complete with hand-clapping, and failed. I was literally just trying to explain that our names had the same number of syllables in them. (This isn’t meant to do anything but show that this was a completely new concept to her, it’s not that she wasn’t capable of understanding it.) Also? No state assistance/financial aid for college. Literally zero. Max full time student loans and I still had to LEAVE THE STATE TO AVOID HOMELESSNESS, and I was working 35+ hours a week. Maybe it had something to do with having to spend so much money on bottled water, since half the time you have to actually boil your tap water before drinking it or using it for anything because it’s full of bacteria. I made it out just in time to miss a massive tuberculosis outbreak that coincided with closing the last TB hospital in the state, and the subsequent government coverup.  There are three big problems with Florida, the Least Sustainable State, and they provide an excellent lesson in how not to do things. 1. The ecology is incompatible with the lifestyle that people wish to use it for. Essentially, this is a state that requires life support equipment for modern existence. America colonized it like invaders terraforming a hostile planet. Florida, a delicate and unique swamp home to distinct and important plants, animals and indigenous humans, was perfectly acceptable as such. But by paving it over with concrete and lawns, we have created a hostile, muggy, parched hellscape that requires air-conditioning to sustain this occupying force of alien life. The very geology is outraged. The ground is so thinly spread over a bubbling seething mass of resentment that you can pretty much feel it. This sounds made up but do sample the thick mist of resentment next time you visit Florida. Florida has been terraformed unsustainably and against its will and it knows it and it hates you and it’s like moving into a haunted house, BUT THE HOUSE IS THE WHOLE STATE, 2. The population of elderly snowbirds and retirees, predominantly white people who hire Mexican gardeners while complaining about Mexican gardeners , deliberately fosters income inequality - they literally terraformed a state so they could create decadent golf courses with magic gates to keep out the brown people - which creates  3. An entire population of wealthy influential voters are very much against anything that would reduce income inequality in the state because it won’t benefit them, and a population of impoverished people who cannot afford to vote or move. The beleaguered shreds of the middle class, having noticed the psychic tremors being sent up from geology that literally wants to kill them, usually bolt when they realise that they live in Florida. More realistically: Who makes the town hall meetings at 11 am on a Wednesday? Not working mothers or young people. Retirees. Retirees go to those meetings. Who votes in a state with embarrassing labor laws, political corruption and a new fraud scandal every few years? Retirees. Retirees vote. The nihilistic kind of walking dead, who don’t live in the states they raised their own children in because THEY DIDN’T HAVE ENOUGH FRIENDS OR CLOSE FAMILY TO KEEP THEM IN THE COMMUNITIES THEY INVESTED THEIR LIVES IN, oh god who are these people, not beloved community participants, for one;; What do retirees vote for? Not school funding, that’s for sure. Not social programs. No, retirees who have moved to Florida have other Concerns. Namely, state-funded police patrols to ensure that the only PoC sighted in their gated communities are there to mow the lawns. They don’t care about the children of Florida - their own grandkids are all in Boston, after all, so who cares about the cleaning lady’s kids? If she wants a better life for them she should move somewhere with prospects - and they want better policing for their gated communities, and political representation.  This is vastly simplistic, and not put across very well, and Floridians will probably get mad at me, and I’m sorry, I’m awfully fond of you and I do enjoy your state and I am SO talking out of my ass: It is just a bloody creepy dystopia, is what I am saying.  But when politicians push for a society that takes even LESS notice of the environment, that cares even LESS about children and schools and social welfare, that is LESS ecologically respectful and sustainable, that cares LESS about government-funded frivolities like functioning roads and sewers, that has LESS social mobility and MORE income inequality and MORE gated communities, Just remember that America has already done that social experiment, And it’s called Florida, And everyone hates it.    The very geology is outraged. The ground is so thinly spread over a bubbling seething mass of resentment that you can pretty much feel it.   Holy shit, that explains all the goddamn sinkholes!(Actually it’s that a LOT of the state is a thin layer of topsoil over limestone aquifers which, thanks to the ever growing demand for fresh water, have a tendency to suddenly collapse into pits, some big enough to swallow a house.)"

For the most part, it went unnoticed. There was no snow, and, unlike on the surrounding plains, people didn’t grow many things in the city. That was part of the problem, Sam Vimes learned as he sat through meeting after interminable meeting. Anhk-Morpork imported its food, and at the moment the crops that were supposed to be feeding the city in a few months were out freezing in their fields. He listened to Lord Vetinari and the Guild leaders and some panicked representatives from the Sto Plains talk about supply chains and international imports and which crops could still be re-sown until his ears ached.  As he marched home that night, he didn’t notice that every lilac he passed was shedding, green buds that had just been beginning to swell when the frost hit littering the ground at his feet. He didn’t notice until he woke up on the 25th of May and realized with a jolt that he hadn’t smelled a single lilac the previous day. Normally, the city was thick with the scent and he did his best to ignore it until the day when he couldn’t.  Keep reading " False text

(source: @hawkwoman) The poor guy never stood a chance.  Fuck I never noticed how thoroughly she wrecked him. Like I don’t think he even realized what was happening.  Ive never watched Wonder Woman, but why is she sliding down that floor so smoothly  She has basically knee pads.  I think they stylized the way she moves to suggest flight and speed as second nature to her. I’m guessing they wanted to differentiate her movement from Superman’s, which can be explained in canon as the simple fact that her powers are different, come from a different source, as she’s been training her entire life. She’s a demigod, so her movement is…I think lighter is a good way to describe it? Whereas Superman is stomping around in direct defiance of all Earthly physical laws because he’s not human, Diana’s powers are almost angelic. She’s still a direct product of this earth and power found here. These powers are new to her in this film, but they’re rooted right here. She moves like she’s always sort of flying. We really haven’t seen anyone else in the DCEU move like this, but that makes sense when you consider we have yet to meet any other Amazonian demigods. The Kryptonians are brutal. Everything is heavy, hard, and booming. Meanwhile, Diana flying: Even when she’s coming to do violence her movement suggests that she’s moving in concert with the earth instead of in defiance of it. It has a more supernatural feel. Anyway, have I mentioned lately how much I love that they put clear thought and design in how each character would move instead of the easier path of just handing Diana and Clark identical powers.

Rai wrote a shorter piece about it in Quartz, which is a pretty light but still illuminating (hah, I did not see that pun coming but I’m gonna leave it) read. the upshot of Fiske and Rai’s work is that most violence is fundamentally misunderstood because we think it is inherently outside the norms of a supposedly moral society. we presume that when someone commits a mass shooting or beats their spouse they are somehow intrinsically broken, either incapable of telling right from wrong or too lacking in self-control to prevent themselves from doing the wrong thing. but what Fiske and Rai found was that, in fact, the opposite is true: most violence is morally motivated. people who commit violent acts aren’t lacking moral compasses - they believe those violent acts are not only morally acceptable, but morally obligatory. usually, these feelings emerge in the context of a relationship which is culturally defined as hierarchical. in other words, parents who commit violence against their children do so because they believe it is necessary that they do so in order to establish or affirm the dominance which they feel they are owed by both tradition and moral right. when abusive parents say that they are “hitting children for their own good”, they are not speaking in terms of any rational predictions for the child’s future, but rather from a place of believing that the child must learn to be submissive in order to be a “good” child, to fulfill their place in the relationship.  this kind of violence is not the result of calm, intellectually reasoned deliberation about the child’s well-being.   for that reason and that reason alone it will never be ended by scientific evidence. history tells us more than we need to verify this. the slave trade and the institution of racial slavery, and their attendant forms of “corrective” physical violence, for instance, did not end because someone demonstrated they were physically or psychologically harmful to slaves - that was never a question in people’s minds to begin with. for generations, slavery was upheld as right and good not because it was viewed as harmless, but because it was viewed as morally necessary that one category of people should be “kept in their place” below another by any means necessary, because they were lower beings by natural order and god’s law. this violence ended because western society became gradually less convinced of the whole moral framework at play, not because we needed scientists to come along and demonstrate that chain gangs and whippings were psychologically detrimental. this is only one example from a world history filled with many, many forms of violence, both interpersonal and structural, which ultimately were founded on the idea that moral hierarchies must be maintained through someone’s idea of judiciously meted-out suffering. and this, ultimately, is why we cannot end violence against children by pointing out that it is harmful - because the question of whether or not it is harmful does not enter into parents’ decisions about whether or not to commit violence in the first place. what they care about is not the hypothetical harm done to the child, but the reinforcement of the authority-ranked nature of the relationship itself. the reason these people so often sound like their primary concern is maintaining their “right” to hit their children is because it is. they believe that anyone telling them they can’t hit their children is attempting to undermine the moral structure of that individual relationship and, in a broader sense, the natural order of adult-child relations in society. and that’s why the movement has to be greater than one against hitting kids. it has to be a movement against treating them as inferior, in general. it has to be a movement that says, children are people, that says children’s rights are human rights, that says the near-absolute authority of parents, coupled with the general social supremacy of adults and the marginalization of youth, have to all be torn down at once as an ideology of injustice and violence. anything less is ultimately pointless.  ^^^ " False text

It’s on the side of an enormous river, they’ve owned the property since 1911, and that’s the ONLY route there. -The Second Unplottable house is in Bedford, Ohio and belonged to my mother’s parents.  It’s at the corner of two side-streets, right across from the tiny Italian grocery store.  Due to strange development decisions, the house is about 30 feet above street level and rendered invisible by a chestnut tree so majestic Hyao Myazaki would probably put it in a movie.  The driveway, however, is VERY visible from any of the surrounding houses, the grocer, or the street.   At least in theory and old photos, becuase if you actually GO there,  your eyes slide right past it to the neighbor’s lillac bush, or to the retro neons of the grocery store or up the Chestnut tree.  it is literally HARD to look at that driveway, all the world around it wants to pull you away. -The Third Unplottable house is in Salinas, CA, home of my paternal grandparents.  It is the single most BORING house possible- like, if you were to ask a third-grader to draw a prototypical house, they would draw my grandparent’s house.  Utterly Unremarkable.  Except for the part where my Grandfather, spurred by his success with the “non-fruiting” peach tree, decided to plant a California Redwood Tree, and it grew to approximately 150 feet over the course of a few short decades.  It is the tallest damn thing for miles around, and SOMEHOW deliveries keep being missed, mail is delivered to the neighbors, and any non-blood family that tried to visit would end up on the other side of town. -The Fourth Unplottable House was the one I grew up in CA.  The Directions to it are as follows:  It’s the Bright Orange house Right Across From The School.  You know, the one with six flamingos and the Volunteer Avacado Tree. SOMEHOW, we got everyone’s mail but OURS (we still wonder about the letter from Fort Knox for Mr. Thomas Saxophone), the other kids got lost trying to visit and ended up in Mr.Phan’s yard on the other end of the block.  Officer Brown, Mom and Dad’s friend, who had GPS back in the early 90′s becuase silicon valley, regularly got lost looking for our place.  The Flamingos did nothing. -My parent’s current house is the second house on the right  after two right turns off the state highway that runs through town.  Sounds easy, right?   Except that due to a couple small trees and a bend in the road, the house is invisible from the road.  I have to stand out in the road if i want my pizza delivered.  The Mailman is the only person who could reliably find the box, but he drives a subaru that’s older than my sister from the passenger side by leaning over, and delivers mail based on the aztec lunar calendar, so he’s probably not actually human.  I tried to host a party, tied rainbow balloons to the mailbox, and all nine friends had to be waved in from the street. -My current apartment building Does Not Exist, according to my Bank, medicaid, Google, and City Hall which was a bit exciting when I first moved in and had to call everyone that yes, I was sitting in a building that really exists.    Unless it’s my classmates, becuase they can apparently come to parties I don’t host. This Friday I had a friend telling me she had a great time at my place last Teusday… when I was home alone.  She assures me that I held a houseparty with “Those polish things you make” (I make great mini klatchky, but haven’t served them to her) and that “You were definitely there, we talked about Carvaggio and you drive me home”  The only thing that offers any explanation is that you were drunk at the anecdote about your recent house party 🎉 nothing else is explainable  I’m deathly allergic to alcohol, and was definitely at home alone, emailing a former professor about werewolves.  Got the chatlog and everything. Guliya’s roommate recalls me dropping her off at the dorms, which is really peculiar.  Another classmate, Jeff, was at the party with Guliya, and they thought it was my place too.  Jeff is a jackass and I’d never invite him to my place. God, I hope I don’t have another doppelganger.  … /another/ doppelganger???  The year is 2014, October.  I have the beginnings of what will prove to be a rotten cold, and I decide to take the precaution of getting an enormous bowl of Pho from my local Vietnamese place in hopes of staving off another respiratory infection. No sooner do I set foot in the door, and Mrs. Nguyen snaps up and shrieks YOU!!  and I am much distressed and confused, because I adore Mrs. Nguyen.  She kept My Intended alive last passover when the cafeteria covered literally everything in flour. She insists that some time in august I had dined with a large group of friends and then skipped out on a $200 dollar tab.  This is even more distressing and also impossible, as I had been in Oregon at the time, and only have like 3 IRL friends.  She is livid, and absolutely insistent that it was me, and that I pay the tab or she’ll call the police.  Being very distressed and not eager to have a panic attack in front of police, I pay up $216.87 and am banned forever.  I go home in tears, without my Pho and am very sick for a fortnight. Two months later, it’s Polish Butter Christmas, and I locate the source of my woes. Polish Butter Christmas is the invention of my Intended’s friend/domesticated internet troll, where everyone deemed a friend or at least interesting party diversion is invited to their house and we all consume massive amounts of Traditional Polish Cooking, which is about 60% butter by weight.  everyone eats way too much, most people also get shitfaced and i usually end up on the floor playing with 4-6 corgis, depending on who’s invited that year.  in 2014, it was all six of them, rustling under the table like a pack of obese furry sausages.   Among the guests invited are myself, my Intended, The Troll’s girlfriend, and her friend.  The latter is 5′2″, whiter than mayonnaise, with bright purple hair and green glasses.  I also am 5′2″, glow under black lights, had bright purple hair and still have green glasses.  We learn furthermore, that we have the same first name and live on the same side of town.  This is laughed off as Most Amusing, at first. The celebration goes on, and I become steadily less amused as I learn that Not-Me is a BITCH.  Racist jokes, yelling at the dogs to make them cower becuase “They look so funny!”, and generally abrasive and cruel.  Everyone is uncomfortable and Troll confides quietly to me in the kitchen that she is not invited next year, but needs an excuse to throw her out, or his dad will have a fit.  Troll’s family is as much a gang of cryptids as mine, and cannot go around Un-Inviting people without Due Cause.  So we agree to suffer quietly and laugh about it next year. Eventually, the conversation turns to “Youthful Shenanigans”, and while most people have the sense to tell stories where they did something dumb but not actually illegal, Not-Me recounts with utter glee “That time me and my hoes dine-and-dashed that one chink place hahaha” I suddenly put two and two together and realize that This Bitch Has Personally Wronged Me. “You CUNT.” I tell her, furious at the realization ad the fact that she’s been steadily ruining Polish Butter Christmas for the last three hours. “Mrs. Nguyen thinks I did that! I HAD TO PAY THE TAB!” “Oh, uh my bad, haha…” She laughed awkwardly. “HA. YES. FUNNY. WE ARE GOING TO THE PLACE, YOU ARE APOLOGIZING TO MRS. NGUYEN AND PAYING ME BACK YOU INSUFFERABLE BITCH.”  I yelled, grabbing her arm and dragging her towards the door, Corgis yapping excitedly at our ankles. “Whaa?  No!  fuck you!”  She said, winching her arm out of my grip and doing an amazing four-inch-heel-sprint for the bathroom, locking herself in.   She has made a rather serious error in the Troll is both 1. a 6′6″ Sasquatch of a man, and 2. TOTALLY WILLING to take a crowbar to the bathroom window he’d been planning on renovating anyway, esp if it mean he gets to haul a bitch out and toss her into the back of the minivan with the three least-obese corgis, so that we may drive her, sobbing about injustice the whole way. Nothing in my life will ever be so satisfying as dragging Not-Me into Pho 67, and seeing the look of horror and recognition cross Mrs. Nguyen’s face as she realized what had happened, then having Not-Me withdraw the money from the ATM at the front. We then returned to Polish Butter Christmas and had a splendid time feeding buttered pork to the corgis. But you see why I am loathe to deal with another one.  Every sentence that gets added just reinforces that this is a Neil Gaiman story in the Sandman universe near the Ocean at the end of the Lane. And no one’s gonna question the werewolf email to Prof?  Congratulations on being the first person to ask about the werewolves!  Prof Hoffman teaches a course called Freaks And Monsters, which was THE BEST literature course I’ve ever taken and she was the first person to get my idiot brain to understand symbolism. I’m writing a book about Crypids In America and was emailing her to see if she had any recommended reading for me, and to introduce her to my Botany professor becuase I think they’d be friends.  She was a little late replying to me becuase she’s in Rome documenting gargoyles, but she and Botany prof are planning an expedition to Moscow to retrieve a book for rare mushroom plates before the crazy cat lady who’s keeping it accidentally destroys them.

He doesn’t remember his own birthday half the time, and when people ask him how old he is, he has to count backwards using his fingers.  But he knows the names of all the dogs he encounters in Hasetsu. “Aki!” he says to the storeowner’s dog, as he bikes past on his way to the Ice Castle. Aki is a terrier mutt, small and a determined barker. “Good morning, Aki!” Which store owner? Damned if he knows. He’s been introduced a few times. Aki’s person. Victor is fairly certain he has two eyes and a face? “Hi, Masa,” he says at lunch. Masa is the dog that lives somewhat near the castle. Masa is a shiba inu, and really likes tuna onigiri. He can detect the sound of a bento being opened from half a mile away; it never takes him more than a minute to materialize in the middle of Victor’s lunch. He sits two feet from Makkachin, giving Victor soulful sad eyes as he goes through the bento that Yuuri’s mother has made for him. Victor is no idiot–Makkachin has taught him well that a dog that knows how to make “I’m a poor neglected dog that never gets fed” eyes is almost certainly a dog who has a devoted human who is a sucker for sad dog eyes. But Victor is also a sucker for sad dog eyes. Hiroko Katsuki has started adding extra onigiri, just for Masa. (“No salt,” she explained to him. She’s a good egg.) Yori plays with Makkachin in the afternoons when Yuuri is cross-training. Yori is a brown dog with three white paws, not to be confused with Toshi, who is a slightly browner dog with two white paws and one yellow paw. Toshi lives closer to the onsen, anyway. “Which dog is that?” Yuuri asks, as they’re walking home. Victor sees a flash out of the corner of his eye before the dog disappears. It’s enough. “Kouta. You can tell by the freckles on the paws. Riku has the same coloring but no freckles.” “Who does Kouta belong to?” Yuuri asks. Someone, Victor is sure. He’s been introduced a time or five. Some human…with two eyes, probably a face? He’s not really sure.  “Kouta’s owner,” Victor finally says. He doesn’t know why Yuuri is cracking up.

I didn’t even know Australia had a ‘20s until I watched this show. Upon closer study, it seems plausible Miss Fisher is absolutely ruthless, clever, dangerous, insightful, and willing to go to any length to solve her case - including playing any number of fanciful parts, scaling large buildings, getting herself nearly poisoned to death, and otherwise putting herself in physical and emotional danger - and she does all this without having to sacrifice her love of pretty things. She scales those buildings in beautiful hand-tooled Italian heels. She is always impeccably, gorgeously dressed, and doesn’t ever change that about herself, even when she starts being taken more seriously by the police force or when she is doing serious detective work like interviewing wicked murderers or hunting for the man who killed her sister. Miss Fisher is only ever entirely herself. She adopts strays like no one’s business. There’s something very appealing about the story of a woman who has seen terrible, gruesome things, decided afterwards to dedicate her life entirely to pleasure, and then (almost despite herself) ended up becoming a philanthropist and a den mother and a doer-of-good. I have seen this story many many many (many, many) times from a male perspective, but not so often from a female viewpoint, and Miss Fisher does it without ever begrudging what she’s become. She’s infinitely more graceful than every other good-guy-against-his-better-judgment story I’ve watched or read. THE END " False text

She suggested this with the kind of half-arsed, sad-eyed, apologetic shrug that white women perform when it is less of a scene to administer psychological warfare against a brown child than it is to challenge your fellow white woman. That was my entire childhood.  I remember well the acute shock and confusion of that day. I  had been so damn sure Becky and I were having a good time.

David Miller, a professor of sociology at Bath University and an authority in psyops and propaganda, says it is “an extraordinary scandal that this should be anywhere near a democracy. It should be clear to voters where information is coming from, and if it’s not transparent or open where it’s coming from, it raises the question of whether we are actually living in a democracy or not.” “And it was Facebook that made it possible. It was from Facebook that Cambridge Analytica obtained its vast dataset in the first place. Earlier, psychologists at Cambridge University harvested Facebook data (legally) for research purposes and published pioneering peer-reviewed work about determining personality traits, political partisanship, sexuality and much more from people’s Facebook “likes”. And SCL/Cambridge Analytica contracted a scientist at the university, Dr Aleksandr Kogan, to harvest new Facebook data. And he did so by paying people to take a personality quiz which also allowed not just their own Facebook profiles to be harvested, but also those of their friends – a process then allowed by the social network.” Read this.

His first slap on his face was when Congress decided not to affect most domestic spending provisions for the balance of the current federal fiscal year (ends September 30), including the EPA’s budget. Rather than being slashed 30% or so, it was cut by just 1%. But here’s the better part. trump and his minions were stupid enough (and maybe by law they had to show their stupidity) to break out the huge cuts and apply them to specific programs. For example, he slashes the $300 million Great Lakes Initiative to zero and slashes clean up for the Chesapeake Bay and Puget Sound and the Gulf of Mexico to zero each. That puts at risk the livelihoods of thousands of people who live in the ocean coastal areas and jeopardizes the drinking water for millions of people in the Great Lakes Basin. As a consequence, trump has inadvertently (hence the stupid part) caused unlikely coalitions to form consisting of republican and Democratic senators and congresspeople from red states and blue states to fight these cuts. And as they form coalitions, other programs are benefitting, such as the environmental justice programs that trump proposes to eliminate. So, if this is all true and if these coalitions hold, and if trump continues to piss off politicians by having weekly impeachable moments, looks like the EPA budget will probably be spared, and, in some cases, I wouldn’t be surprised to see increases in budgeted line items for specific programs.

Buckley once said. Not so in the United States, at least not regarding the Civil War. As soon as the Confederates laid down their arms, some picked up their pens and began to distort what they had done and why. The resulting mythology took hold of the nation a generation later and persists — which is why a presidential candidate can suggest, as Michele Bachmann did in 2011, that slavery was somehow pro-family and why the public, per the Pew Research Center, believes that the war was fought mainly over states’ rights. The Confederates won with the pen (and the noose) what they could not win on the battlefield: the cause of white supremacy and the dominant understanding of what the war was all about. We are still digging ourselves out from under the misinformation they spread, which has manifested in our public monuments and our history books. Take Kentucky, where the legislature voted not to secede. Early in the war, Confederate Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston ventured through the western part of the state and found “no enthusiasm, as we imagined and hoped, but hostility.” Eventually, 90,000 Kentuckians would fight for the United States, while 35,000 fought for the Confederate States. Nevertheless, according to historian Thomas Clark, the state now has 72 Confederate monuments and only two Union ones. Neo-Confederates also won parts of Maryland. In 1913, the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) put a soldier on a pedestal at the Rockville courthouse. Maryland, which did not secede, sent 24,000 men to the Confederate armed forces, but it also sent 63,000 to the U.S. Army and Navy. Still, the UDC’s monument tells visitors to take the other side: “To our heroes of Montgomery Co. Maryland: That we through life may not forget to love the thin gray line.” In fact, the thin gray line came through Montgomery and adjoining Frederick counties at least three times, en route to Antietam, Gettysburg and Washington. Robert E. Lee’s army expected to find recruits and help with food, clothing and information. It didn’t. Instead, Maryland residents greeted Union soldiers as liberators when they came through on the way to Antietam. Recognizing the residents of Frederick as hostile, Confederate cavalry leader Jubal Early ransomed $200,000 from them lest he burn their town, a sum equal to about $3 million today. But Frederick now boasts a Confederate memorial, and the manager of the town’s cemetery — filled with Union and Confederate dead — told me, “Very little is done on the Union side” around Memorial Day. “It’s mostly Confederate.” Neo-Confederates didn’t just win the battle of public monuments. They managed to rename the war, calling it the War Between the States, a locution born after the conflict that was among the primary ways to refer to the war in the middle of the 20th century, after which it began to fade. Even “Jeopardy!” has used this language. Perhaps most perniciously, neo-Confederates now claim that the South seceded over states’ rights. Yet when each state left the Union, its leaders made clear that they were seceding because they were for slavery and against states’ rights. In its “Declaration of the Causes Which Impel the State of Texas to Secede From the Federal Union,” for example, the secession convention of Texas listed the states that had offended the delegates: “Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa.” Governments there had exercised states’ rights by passing laws that interfered with the federal government’s attempts to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act. Some no longer let slave owners “transit” across their territory with slaves. “States’ rights” were what Texas was seceding against. Texas also made clear what it was seceding for — white supremacy: We hold as undeniable truths that the governments of the various States, and of the confederacy itself, were established exclusively by the white race, for themselves and their posterity; that the African race had no agency in their establishment; that they were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race, and in that condition only could their existence in this country be rendered beneficial or tolerable. Despite such statements, neo-Confederates erected monuments that flatly lied about the Confederate cause. For example, South Carolina’s monument at Gettysburg, dedicated in 1963, claims to explain why the state seceded: “Abiding faith in the sacredness of states rights provided their creed here.” This tells us nothing about 1863, when abiding opposition to states’ rights provided the Palmetto State’s creed. In 1963, however, its leaders did support states’ rights; politicians tried desperately that decade to keep the federal government from enforcing school desegregation and civil rights. So thoroughly did this mythology take hold that our textbooks still stand history on its head and say secession was for, rather than against, states’ rights. Publishers mystify secession because they don’t want to offend Southern school districts and thereby lose sales. Consider this passage from “The American Journey,” probably the largest textbook ever foisted on middle school students and perhaps the best-selling U.S. history textbook: The South Secedes Lincoln and the Republicans had promised not to disturb slavery where it already existed. Nevertheless, many people in the South mistrusted the party, fearing that the Republican government would not protect Southern rights and liberties. On December 20, 1860, the South’s long-standing threat to leave the Union became a reality when South Carolina held a special convention and voted to secede.   The section reads as if slavery was not the reason for secession. Instead, the rationale is completely vague: White Southerners feared for their “rights and liberties.” On the next page, the authors are more precise: White Southerners claimed that since “the national government” had been derelict ” — by refusing to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act and by denying the Southern states equal rights in the territories — the states were justified in leaving the Union.”   “Journey” offers no evidence to support this claim. It cannot. No Southern state made any such charge against the federal government in any secession document I have ever seen. Abraham Lincoln’s predecessors, James Buchanan and Franklin Pierce, were part of the pro-Southern wing of the Democratic Party. For 10 years, the federal government had vigorously enforced the Fugitive Slave Act. Buchanan supported pro-slavery forces in Kansas even after his own minion, territorial governor and former Mississippi slave owner Robert Walker, ruled that they had won an election only by fraud. The seven states that seceded before Lincoln took office had no quarrel with “the national government.” Teaching or implying that the Confederate states seceded for states’ rights is not accurate history. It is white, Confederate-apologist history. “Journey,” like other U.S. textbooks, needs to be de-Confederatized. So does the history test we give to immigrants who want to become U.S. citizens. Item No. 74 asks them to “name one problem that led to the Civil War.” It then gives three acceptable answers: slavery, economic reasons and states’ rights. (No other question on this 100-item test has more than one right answer.) If by “economic reasons” it means issues with tariffs and taxes, which most people infer, then two of its three “correct answers” are wrong. The legacy of this thinking pervades Washington, too. The dean of the Washington National Cathedral has noted that some of its stained-glass windows memorialize Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee. There’s a statue of Albert Pike, Confederate general and reputed leader of the Arkansas Ku Klux Klan, in Judiciary Square. The Army runs Fort A.P. Hill, named for a Confederate general whose men killed African American soldiers after they surrendered; Fort Bragg, named for a general who was not only Confederate but also incompetent; and Fort Benning, named for a general who, after he helped get his home state of Georgia to secede, made the following argument to the Virginia legislature:   What was the reason that induced Georgia to take the step of secession? This reason may be summed up in one single proposition. It was a conviction . . . that a separation from the North was the only thing that could prevent the abolition of her slavery. . . . If things are allowed to go on as they are, it is certain that slavery is to be abolished. . . . By the time the North shall have attained the power, the black race will be in a large majority, and then we will have black governors, black legislatures, black juries, black everything. . . . The consequence will be that our men will be all exterminated or expelled to wander as vagabonds over a hostile Earth, and as for our women, their fate will be too horrible to contemplate even in fancy.   With our monuments lying about secession, our textbooks obfuscating what the Confederacy was about and our Army honoring Southern generals, no wonder so many Americans supported the Confederacy until recently. We can see the impact of Confederate symbols and thinking on Dylann Roof, accused of killing nine in a Charleston, S.C., church, but other examples abound. In his mugshot, Timothy McVeigh, who bombed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995, wore a neo-Confederate T-shirt showing Abraham Lincoln and the words “Sic semper tyrannis.” When white students in Appleton, Wis. — a recovering “sundown town” that for decades had been all white on purpose — had issues with Mexican American students in 1999, they responded by wearing and waving Confederate flags, which they already had at home, at the ready. Across the country, removing slavery from its central role in prompting the Civil War marginalizes African Americans and makes us all stupid. De-Confederatizing the United States won’t end white supremacy, but it will be a momentous step in that direction.  Also, I urge you to take a look at these awful monuments at Vice.com: Yup,   America Still Has a Ton of Racist Monuments (December 13, 2015)  So, General Benning was the founder of the “White Genocide” movement? Yet another good reason to hate him.  Let me remind everyone that any monument honoring Confederate soldiers is honoring traitors  Slightly tangentially, I shall now inform you-all that the writer of the linked piece, James Loewen, also wrote an incredibly important book called Sundown Towns: A Hidden Dimension of American Racism. He concluded:Outside the traditional South—states historically dominated by slavery, where sundown towns are rare—probably a majority of all incorporated places kept out African Americans. … Illinois, for example, had 671 towns and cities with more than 1,000 people in 1970, of which 475—71%—were all-white in census after census. … almost all of these 475 were sundown towns. There is reason to believe that more than half of all towns in Oregon, Indiana, Ohio, the Cumberlands, the Ozarks, and diverse other areas were also all-white on purpose. Sundown suburbs are found from Darien, Connecticut, to La Jolla, California, and are even more prevalent; indeed, most suburbs began life as sundown towns.Even more valuable, he’s got a Sundown Towns website with a crowd-sourced database.  I urge all my fellow white people to look up places they’ve lived or heard about in the Sundown Towns database, and become conscious that every “lily-white” place that looks normal to them is that way because white people made an effort to make it so."

Like an origami master, it folds them up into a neat package, tucking them away within a slender sliver of space between its abdomen and the usually polka-dotted, harder wings that protect it. When it is time to take off, it deploys its flying apparatus from beneath its colorful shell-like top wings, called the elytra, in only a tenth of a second. And when it lands, it folds it back in just two. Switching between flying and crawling many times in a day, the ladybug travels vast distances. To the naked eye, this elegant transformation is a mystery. But scientists in Japan created a window into the process in a study published Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Just how the ladybug manages to cram these rigid structures into tiny spaces is a valuable lesson for engineers designing deployable structures like umbrellas and satellites. A ladybug’s hind wings are sturdy enough to keep it in the air for up to two hours and enable it to reach speeds up to 37 miles an hour and altitudes as high as three vertically stacked Empire State Buildings. Yet they fold away with ease. These seemingly contradictory attributes perplexed Kazuya Saito, an aerospace engineer at the University of Tokyo and the lead author of the study.  Continue Reading.
