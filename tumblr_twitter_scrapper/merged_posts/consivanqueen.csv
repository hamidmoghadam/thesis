In Chicago we’ll be working with Project Fierce, an incredible organization that aims to reduce LGBTQ youth homelessness in Chicago by providing accessible housing and support services. At a time when LGBTQ youth are at greater risk for depression, bullying, and violence, than their peers, organizations like Project Fierce are a necessary resource for teens that don’t feel safe. About 40% of homeless American teens identify as LGBTQ and Project Fierce can provide them with a safe and comfortable environment. Want a ticket upgrade?

Kansas City has a rich history of LGBTQ activism, and reminds us just how important a safe space can be! :~) In the 1980’s, with the discovery of AIDS and increased discrimination against the LGBTQ community, some women in the Kansas City area started Phoenix Books. This local gathering space gave the LGBTQ community a safe space to gather, read, debate, and even make change. The community created at Phoenix Books gave people like Jon Barnett, the founder of a local AIDS-activism group, the encouragement to run of political office as an openly gay man. Though Barnett lost his bid for city council, the message was sent, LGBTQ people existed in Kansas City. This was a huge step in the process for Kansas City to pass an ordinance banning discrimination based on sexual orientation. Tonight, we partner with LIKEME Lighthouse-KC which is a volunteer-based organization that connects the LGBTQ community to resources that they can take advantage of. They also offer on-site counseling services. Because LGBTQ individuals, particularly youth, may not know where to go to get services such as therapy, housing, or even entertainment, LIKEME Lighthouse-KC is a valuable resource. Your support of this organization will help local youth get connected to services they may otherwise go without. Want a ticket upgrade? We’re taking donations that are often taken for granted. We are asking that you bring lightly used prom wear to donate at the show. Bring at least one to be entered in a raffle for a ticket upgrade. See you tonight!! Troye x" False text

LGBTQ history runs deep in Dallas, and The Dallas Way keeps great record of it. Founded in 2011, the organization’s mission is to compile the untold stories of local LGBTQ community members. The Dallas Way has partnered with the University of North Texas to create a digital exhibit chronicling the people, issues, and events that were important to the LGBTQ community in this area. On the #SuburbiaTour we are focusing on LGBTQ-inclusive curriculum in schools.  The work that these two organizations are doing is immensely important. If LGBTQ history isn’t made available to the public, it will be like these people never existed. If LGBTQ kids grow up seeing people they identify with making a difference and shaping the world in which they live, they will know that they too, can make an impact in the world. The organization we are working with tonight is The Resource Center. The Resource Center’s Youth First program is one of the only programs in the area specifically focused on the needs of LGBTQ youth. With approximately 15,000 LGBTQ youth living in North Texas, these services are vital in helping them with issues they face with their family members, peers, and fellow students. Youth First serves those ages 12-18, helping them strengthen healthy relationships, and build the confidence they need to lead an authentic life. Want a ticket upgrade?

Houston’s LGBTQ community took off in the ‘60s centering around the gay neighborhood of Montrose, which grew to include popular bars such as Montrose Mining Company in ‘78. Starting in 1995, the Houston Splash event has attracted thousands as it celebrates the black and latino LGBTQ communities. With the election of Annise Parker in 2010, Houston became one of the first major cities in the U.S. to elect an openly gay mayor.I’m so so so looking forward to seeing everyone dancing here tonight!!!Troye xWant a ticket upgrade?

About the city - In 1971, Austin held the first pride parade in Texas, kicking off the city’s vibrant LGBTQ community. In 1987, Austin’s Glen Maxey became executive director of the Lesbian/Gay Rights Lobby of Texas. His 1991 election to the Texas House of Representatives showed growing acceptance in a state that still criminalized same-gender relationships. The city has now continued to create a widespread LGBTQ community.For our Austin show our partner is Equality Texas, an organization whose mission is to secure full equality for LGBTQ Texans. Working for just legislation and protection for LGBTQ youth, Equality Texas encourages Texans to take action through education, community organizing, and collaboration.Equality Texas is super dedicated to protecting Texas’ youth and is constantly working on promoting legislation that prohibits discrimination in schools. They focus on supporting young members of the LGBTQ community within their family, school, and social lives. Want a ticket upgrade? We’re taking donations to enter into a raffle for a ticket upgrade.

Since then, LA has been on the edge of LGBTQ issues - Griffith Park, for example, was the home to the first “Gay In”, where LGBTQ individuals gathered together in the name of solidarity.For tonight’s show we are partnering with Safe Place for Youth. Since 2010, SPY has grown from a volunteer-only organization to a staff of 13 professionals. SPY serves nearly 1,000 homeless youth ages 12-25 in Los Angeles, with a disproportionate number of those youth identifying as LGBTQ. SPY offers programs such as drop-in services, case management, education and employment support, and health care to assist their clients in transitioning to a stable life away from the streets. They are super connected with the homeless youth population in West LA, and work hard to provide a positive, trauma-informed environment for them. As well as offering meals and clothing, SPY officially added showers to their facility in July. Amenities like this give the center a home-like feel, allowing young people to feel safe and relaxed while receiving life-saving support. We’d love for u guys to bring new socks to donate to Safe Place For Youth. Bring at least one to be entered in a raffle for a ticket upgrade <3Love Troye x" False text
