Both my parents are mixed. I have white family on both sides,” she said. “The older I get, the more I experience life, I am identifying more and more with being black, and what that means — being more and more proud of that and feeling connected to my roots and my history.”Kravitz said attending predominantly white schools often made her feel disconnected from her blackness growing up and that fully embracing her identity was sometimes a struggle. “It’s been a really interesting journey because I was always one of the only black kids in any of my schools,” she said. “I went to private schools full of white kids. I think a lot of that made me want to blend in or not be looked at as black.”“The white kids are always talking about your hair and making you feel weird,” she added. “I had this struggle of accepting myself as black and loving that part of myself.”Kravitz said she has since evolved and experienced a “big shift” in her life that has led her to fully embrace her identity and take pride in being black, which she says especially means a lot to her father, who is no stranger to unapologetic expression.“Now I’m so in love with my culture and so proud to be black,” she said. “It’s still ongoing, but a big shift has occurred. My dad especially has always been very connected to his history, and it’s important to him that I understand where I come from.” (cont. HuffPo) Keep that in mind because I’m coming back to it, but first I want to address The Real Housewives of Potomac aka The Sisterhood of the Travelling Vanessa Williamses.A bit of history on this show for those who are interested and/or aren’t familiar.  (You can skip this paragraph if this doesn’t appeal to you.)  The first season of this show had a decidedly tepid reception, especially from the Black community to which it was marketed given that it was bundled with The Real Housewives of Atlanta.  So many of the episodes seemed to revolve around etiquette, decorum, manners, behavior in their social circle of elite Black folks in Potomac, which was already a stretch because A) some of them didn’t live in Potomac and B) Black folks only make up 4.6% of Potomac.  We were all worn out from hearing them give each other lectures on how to behave in social situations, but that’s how the show was pitched to the cast by Bravo.  It was supposed to be a look at a group of women associated with Jack & Jill of America, the bougie, elitist Black organization based in Washington DC and how they represent themselves and the organization.  J&J heard about the show and told Bravo they wanted no part of it, they wanted no association with Bravo, and they wanted no mention of Jack & Jill on Bravo, ever.  So, the show was re-tooled about three-quarters of the way through filming and became a Real Housewives franchise instead.  The second season is decidedly less focused on manners and feels more like the rest of the franchise, but if you managed to finish last season like I did, you caught some very real conversations about race that I personally had never seen on television before.In the first season, there were two mixed cast members: Ashley (white mom, Black dad)and Katie (Black mom, white (Jewish) dad)There were also two very light, very blonde women who did not consider themselves mixed at all:Robynand GizelleDuring one argument, Robyn asks Katie a question about white men (both Katie and Ashley were in relationships with white men, while Robyn & Gizelle only date Black men) and Katie makes the point that she’s biracial and so are Gizelle and Robyn.  Robyn and Gizelle both say they’re Black because they have no direct white ancestor, and that’s a topic that never really gets fleshed out when we talk about race in America.(I assume by “direct white ancestor” she meant no white parents or grandparents because clearly someone is white further down her tree and almost certainly more than a few people.)Katie and Ashley both grew up in a household with one Black parent and one white parent.  They were exposed to both sides.  They grew up as biracial girls.  The fact that both of them are dating white men also speaks to that point because – like it or not, the facts can’t be denied – Black women are less likely to date outside of their race than any other demographic.  Two biracial women in a cast of six both married to or dating white men definitely lends more credence to that statistic, that you are more likely to date a white man if you are a biracial Black woman than if consider yourself to be only Black.Robyn and Gizelle, phenotypically, appear much closer to white than Katie, but both of them are Black women because they didn’t grow up with a white parent.  Obviously they both are children of mixed parents and it could go back generations.  Because of colorism and “passing” and the paper bag test, there are quite a number of Black families in this country where everyone looks more like Gizelle than Katie because to maintain that social capital from Reconstruction through the Civil Rights movement, they only married other very light skinned Black people who were also the products of mixed parentage at some point in their history.  But.  They’re still Black.  Both of Gizelle’s parents went to segregated schools in the South.  When her father was elected to the Texas House of Representatives in 1966, he was among the first Black Representatives in that state since 1896 (two other Black candidates were elected in the same year).  The reason Gizelle and Robyn are so connected to their Blackness is because they are the children of mixed Black people who were born in the 30s and 40s.  You didn’t identify as “mixed” back then.  If you had any Negro blood, you were Black and you lived with all of the restrictions that being Black shackled you with.Zoe Kravitz is the child of mixed parents who were born in the late 60s.  Lisa Bonet and Lenny Kravitz both have one white parent and one Black parent, but neither of them remember an America before the Civil Rights movement.  Lenny Kravtiz grew up in Beverly Hills even further removed from the day-to-day issues of being Black in America.  Lisa Bonet grew up on the Cosby Show as part of America’s Ideal Black Family, but clearly she doesn’t move through the world the way a mixed Black woman like Tracee Ellis Ross does.  It seems trite and superficial to point it out, but it’s relevant to how we contextualize race.  Because race is a social construct, most of how we perceive it is based on social interaction and the society in which we live.  A mixed woman who looks like Lisa Bonet benefits from more social capital and privilege than a mixed woman who looks like Halle Berry.Now you can see a distinct contrast between a Black-identifying woman like Gizelle Bryant who grew up with two Black-identifying parents of the pre-Civil Rights Movement, and a mixed-identifying woman like Zoe Kravitz who grew up with two mixed-identifying parents of entertainment industry in a more accepting racial climate.  Even now, Zoe has a long road ahead of her on her way to full acceptance of her Blackness and how she moves through the world because she has yet to address the benefits of her mixed heritage.  Because of how light she is, she gets to be the token speck of color in all white casts like Little Big Lies and that horrendous looking Scarlett Johansson comedy coming out soon, while also serving as the love interest in a Black cast for movies like Dope. I think we’re in a time where “mixed” as a self-identifier is finally becoming socially acceptable.  At the same time, mixed and Black aren’t mutually exclusive, because race being the social construct that it is, most mixed people are still considered Black by the world.  Still, that doesn’t take into account that they have two distinct cultures and parental histories that inform their upbringing.  I had a conversation like this with a mixed Black woman a few weeks ago who’d had an argument in college about how she identifies.  Zoe Kravitz is definitely mixed and I don’t want to take any of that away from her.  But she’s also a Black woman with a voice and a platform and in this political and social climate, I’m glad to see that she’s starting to embrace that more."

It overturned “separate but equal,“ ending legal school segregation. Students were finally able to say the Pledge of Allegiance together. (Facebook: NAACP) This is three years old, but I just saw the memory and these things always make me think of my parents, neither of whom ever shared a school with white kids even though they graduated long after this ruling.  Our ""history” is so current, and the people who were alive during this fight and pushing back against integration are currently our teachers, police officers, elected officials, judges, and bankers.  Attorney General Jeff Sessions, an Alabama native of Wilcox County, was 8-years-old when Brown vs. the Board of Education was settled, and this New York Times article from 1972 – eighteen years later –  shows how upset white families remained long after public schools were supposedly integrated.  White parents in Wilcox County pulled their kids out of public schools when the faculty was finally ordered to desegregate because they didn’t want Black teachers instructing their white children.  In the twenty years between the end of segregated schools and this article, only one Black student had graduated from a traditionally white high school in Wilcox County, the county where Jeff Sessions received his diploma.  Those twenty years were filled with lawsuits, protests, strikes, and violence because Wilcox County was a predominantly Black county deep in the Black Belt of the South, which means every public school would have more Black students than white if schools were integrated with respect to the area’s racial makeup.Guy S. Kelley, the superintendent of schools for Wilcox County, locked his hands behind his head, leaned back in his chair and began a discussion of some of his problems as a professional educator.“They won’t leave us alone,” he philosophized, pausing momentarily to adjust the weight of the 32‐ caliber revolver dangling in a shoulder holster beneath his left arm pit. “Ever since we lost the war—let’s see now, that’s been about a hundred years, isn’t it?— they’ve been kicking us around like we was dirt.”(cont. New York Times) They would be the Federal Government and the Department of Justice, where one of their own is now supposedly leading the charge to ensure that the law is just and that the system works for all Americans.  I’m not saying a disposition toward equality and fairness is impossible for a white man hailing from a community in the Deep South that was so against integration that all the white kids were pulled out of school two decades after the Supreme Court ruled because they didn’t want to be taught by Black teachers, but it’s highly improbable.  By comparison, Bill Clinton’s school district was integrated with very little fanfare, he memorized the “I Have a Dream” speech, and his grandparents, who owned a store, sold goods on credit to both white and Black customers.  That’s about the best you can hope for from the South out of that generation, and we still got a massive expansion of the prison system that will take generations to undo.There are versions of Jeff Sessions at every level of government.  When someone tells me “slavery was so long ago” as if that fixes all of the problems, I think about my parents, whose first day-to-day interactions with white people were at their first jobs where none of my mom’s co-workers would sit at the same lunch table with her, where my dad carried a knife because of workplace skirmishes with Southern white men who also never went to integrated schools.  I know these stories because my parents told me.  On the other side of that lunchroom, where all the white women sat who wouldn’t sit with my mom, other stories were being formed.  Those women had kids too and I’m sure they told the same stories.  I just wonder what their version is like."

Original stars Roseanne Barr (Roseanne), John Goodman (Dan), Sara Gilbert (Darlene), Laurie Metcalf (Jackie), Michael Fishman (D.J.), and Lecy Goranson (Becky) will appear on the show, which will also feature Sarah Chalke (who played Becky in later seasons) in an undefined role.“The Conners’ joys and struggles are as relevant — and hilarious — today as they were then, and there’s really no one better to comment on our modern America than Roseanne,” Dungey in a press release.(cont. EW) Roseanne is one of my favorite television shows of all time and of my top 20, only the Golden Girls, the Comeback, and Roseanne have all-white casts.  I grew up during the Golden Age of Black Sitcoms because from the late 80s through the early 00s, I could always turn on the television and see people who looked like me.(And then there was that dead space between the end of My Wife & Kids and the debut of Blackish where there were literally no Black television shows on network television.)The point I’m making is, I watched Living Single instead of Friends.  I watched Girlfriends instead of Will & Grace.  But honestly, I also watched Roseanne instead of the Cosby Show, because it was funnier, and looking back on it, more socially relevant.  It was such a smart show and an almost perfect capsule of that time, and that’s why I want them to leave it alone!Exhibit A:  The last season was the worst final season in the history of great television shows.  I don’t even watch the last season anymore and I pretend it doesn’t exist.  What is the continuity supposed to be like when the show comes back?  We learn in the finale that most of the series was a work of fiction in Roseanne’s mind, that Dan was actually dead, that Jackie is a lesbian, and it was the worst closure to any TV show.  Are they going to pretend that last season didn’t happen?Exhibit B: We are living in Trump’s America.  Say what you want about the median income of Trump voters being higher than the media will lead you to believe, that still doesn’t discount the fact that poor white families in the Midwest overwhelmingly voted for him.  In my mind, the Conners were on my side of every important issue from gay marriage to the economy.  Also in my mind, a lot of white families like that in real life were on my side of the important issues and still voted for Trump because they just “didn’t trust Hillary” or some other lame explanation as a front for their white paranoia.Exhibit C:  Roseanne Barr today is not the Roseanne Barr of the 90s.  I can’t stand her.  I don’t know what happened between then and now, but her commentary on the world is always off and more often than not, she completely contradicts herself.  Y'all, she was out here trashing Hillary because Hillary was a career politician and, according to Roseanne, you can’t get that way without taking money from shady characters.  All the while she’s praising Donald for being a man about law & order even though he’s one of the shady characters who tried to buy politicians!  She was pro-Trump because she believes “illegal immigrants come here and get a lot of benefits that our own veterans don’t get.”  She literally said “We would be so lucky if Trump won.”  I don’t want This Roseanne writing another season of one of my favorite television shows. Every single attack on @POTUS is really a disguised attack on American voters who rejected Obama-Clinton-Bush’s bleeding of R treasury.— Roseanne Barr (@therealroseanne) March 20, 2017 Hopefully some information will start to leak out once it goes into production so I can gauge whether or not I should be tuning in for the premiere.  In the meantime, I still have old Roseanne episodes to go on.  It will be great to see Laurie Metcalfe back on television again now that Getting On is off the air.Oo!  And ABC is also Shondaland!  They should do a crossover with Cyrus and bring back the crazy lady.Randomly looked up that crazy lady on Scandal to see if her Southern accent was real and her parents are Jackie and Cyrus. Random. #Scandal pic.twitter.com/p96JHlXBjm— Marine Le Flop (@RafiDAngelo) May 5, 2017 (They shouldn’t really do that.  I just wanna make sure y’all know who the crazy lady’s parents are because my mind was blown.)"

I love all the extra punctuation.  I can just see the flurry of fingers and the angry little expression as @blackwidowlatex came up with his ultimate Ha! Gotcha! moment, as if that argument was so watertight no one would ever be able to counter it.  You know what else isn’t mentioned in the Bill of Rights?  Freedom from slavery, yet here we are, as decent human beings, with the knowledge that you shouldn’t be able to buy and sell people.  The Bill of Rights isn’t the beginning and the end of how an advanced society is supposed to treat its citizens.  I’m not sure if you know this or not, but the Bill of Rights is just the first ten amendments to the Constitution and we’ve been amending it ever since because – you may want to sit down, I don’t want to shock you – legal documents written by rich white men (who lack any familiarity with demographics outside of their own) sometimes have to be adjusted to be inclusive of the population as a whole. Trying to draw these distinctions between what is expressly set down in law and what is acceptable behavior because we’re an advanced society of supposedly logical people is the reason why President Velveeta is able to do half the crap he gets away with. Keep reading  I don’t know where that report was from or what the situation was, but a few years ago my mother was bitten by a cottonmouth (a deadly snake in the southern USA) and her bill wasn’t nearly that high. She was perfectly fine. However, when she was in college she almost died because she had an asthma attack in Canada and couldn’t get into a hospital due to the overcrowding as a result of free healthcare. She was lucky to get into New York to go to the hospital.  4 things: 13th, 14th, 15th and 19th amendments. Not the “Bill of Rights,” but they all guarantee rights to non-whitemen. The 14th especially has been used to grant rights to minority groups, yet there is nothing that guarantees the right to anything for free, even health or support.  Also, I hate to tell you, but Barron Trump is going to go to private school no matter where he lives, and it is very difficult for a child (especially one in his situation) to move schools so abruptly. I do not believe any presidential child has gone to public school in DC, ever.  1) http://www.cbsnews.com/news/rattlesnake-selfie-results-in-a-153k-medical-bill/2) You’re missing the point.  It doesn’t have to be in black & white for it to be a right in a decent society.3) We paid a million dollars a day (actual cost is closer to a million every two days) to cover the cost of protecting Melania and Barron in Trump Tower because they refused to move to the White House in the middle of the school year, like the Obamas and the Clintons did.  They kept him in school in New Jersey instead of moving to DC to put him in school there.  It’s not about the cost of his education – that doesn’t come out of taxpayer funds.4) You wasted a lot of time."

Reuters) This non-ruling from the Supreme Court sets absolutely no precedent and has no implications for future cases of restrictive voting legislation, but it’s still a relief.  The way this SCOTUS is set up at the moment, there’s no certainty that the 4th Circuit’s ruling wouldn’t have been overturned and North Carolina would’ve continued it’s descent into the abyss of white paranoia and bigotry.I’m not going to take you back down all of the history.  I wrote about the Court’s neutering of the Voting Rights Act in 2013 and then I wrote about this very law coming out of North Carolina a few weeks later after basically being given the green light by the Court.  I just want to draw attention to the fact that the Conservative/Liberal balance of the Supreme Court in 2013 was the same as it is right now.  So, the Court that chunked the most important part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is basically the same Court that would have to rule on voting legislation coming out of North Carolina, legislation that the NC Congress and Pat McCrory pushed into law as soon as it became possible to do so under the weakened VRA.  North Carolina wanted to make it harder for minorities, young people, and older people to vote – all demographics that skew Democrat – and they succeeded.  The NAACP appealed and Circuit 4 ruled in favor of justice, so the law became null and void.  Then North Carolina appealed to the Supreme Court.  The reason this case is being thrown out is because of the bickering back and forth over who should be allowed to take responsibility for it.  This issue is a Republican cause and it has made its way to the highest court in the land on the backs of a Republican governor and a Republican attorney general.  Neither of those two people are in office any longer and the Democrats currently holding those posts in North Carolina have no desire to put this case in front of the Supreme Court.  They have the ruling they want right now, from the 4th Circuit.  They risk the Supreme Court ruling in favor of discrimination if they swing for a precedent-setting determination in this case.  NC Republicans in Congress say the case should go forward, the governor and the AG are understandably reluctant to move it forward, and the Court has refused to hear it on the basis of that legal wrangling alone, not because of the merits of the case.  So this issue isn’t decided for the country, but for North Carolina it’s dead for at least another election cycle until there’s enough Republican support from top to bottom to write new legislation to keep Democrats out of the voting booth.  It’s a win on a technicality, but we gotta take what we can get at this point."

Overly Confident Alexis says she’s fine going first or last, since those are the two hardest parts and I guess she wants to shine.  However, she’s still in her head about the reading challenge because the other queens read her about her size, but Alexis……didn’t you just say Shea was gnawing on set pieces?  Body is something you can actually change relatively cheaply, but with lots of effort and determination.  You’re stuck with your teeth unless you have a whole lot of money to fix them, and Shea isn’t in the corner crying about something she has no control over.  However!RuPaul comes in with Ross Matthews and during their little convo with Alexis, she says that the other girls knew about her body image issues and it was something they had all discussed.  So I see her point. If someone says they’re insecure about their body and that they’re struggling with it, why would you make fun of it?  Especially when there’s so much more to work with.Of course RuPaul Andre If You Let Words Hurt You That’s Your Own Problem Charles just disregards that part of the conversation, where Alexis points out it’s a sensitive issue for her that she’s talked about with the girls, and boils it down to Alexis making fun of others but others not being able to make fun of Alexis.Farrah gets a little consult where she says she doesn’t want to be mean because it doesn’t come naturally to her, so Ross gives her some advice there since his brand is also pretty upbeat and jovial.  Let’s see if she takes that advice to heart.Peppermint is funny, but she hasn’t been very witty at all, so who knows how this roast is going to turn out for her since that’s not part of her personality or her act. And Sasha is intellectual so nobody knows how that’s going to translate into roasting a very average “celebrity” to a room of very average people.So the bottom two and the winner are all in that consultation edit with Ross and Ru, obviously, because that’s how the show works, and you might as well call Farrah for the bottom two.  Is this the week she finally goes home?This week’s Backstories While We Beat is super short and centers on Peppermint being detained in Russia 8 months ago.  (The show was shot in 2016, so I’m guessing it was the tail end of 2015 or the very beginning of last year.)  She was presenting as female, which is actually illegal there, but her ID says male, so the agent at the airport flagged her and she was detained.  She took her wig off in line to prove her identity matched the one on the ID, but Peppermint says that still doesn’t take away her womanhood.  Werq, Miss Agnes.I’m here for these glimpses into her trans identity.Time to see what tired jokes these queens wrote about Michelle Visage.  But!  Before we get into the roast, please get into Tamar Braxton’s beat for this episode!!  Refresh your memory with this snap from her last appearance.God bless a drag reality show for forcing you to step up your contouring game!(Try to ignore whatever is going wrong with her weave closure and I’ll try to ignore everything that is going wrong with your life as well.)Anyway, there’s no runway challenge this week, so I'ma throw some pics in here with the queens’ best lines from their performance.Shea Coulee had a few predictable lines about Michelle Visage being a slut (why is that always the go-to? did I miss a tell all biography or something) but she killed me with her closer.If you liked my performance, my name is Shea Coulee.  And if you hated it, my name is Nina Bo'Nina Brown.Sasha Velour just keeps surprising me!  She read everybody on the stage before she hit me with her Jersey Jokes.Michelle is so Jersey her idea of classical music is Lisa Lisa.To get that reference probably takes a certain level of familiarity with 80s pop culture, but I just tweeted a video from Lisa Lisa earlier this week because my neighbor was jamming to it, so it was right in my ballpark.  YAAAAAAAAAAAASSSS!  I used to LOVE this song.  I don’t think I ever knew who it was by. https://t.co/Gq0obhWQkA— Marine Le Flop (@RafiDAngelo) May 11, 2017 Plus, this look is kind of everything and I’m finally getting into her style.  I have to add one more from Sasha while she was introducing the next queen:A queen who combines all the excitement of smiling with the thrill of just standing there, give it up for Valentina!Valentina committed to her Latina Peg Bundy, but she didn’t really deliver anything.  She kind of hit once.Michelle is such a cochina, she can say and spell harder in six different languages.Trinity Taylor’s only successful joke landed because of her costume and because Valentina was up before her.Thank you, Pedro.  Moh-wee, bee-yin.Farrah Moan landed zero punchlines because she’s a complete waste of space in this competition.  She is very lucky Tamar didn’t go straight Baltimore on her ass because she did not sign up for this at all.Tamar Braxton.  She’s Toni Braxton’s less talented, more annoying sister.GIRRRRRRRRRRL!Thank GOD she bombed in such an epic fashion.  There’s no way she’s escaping the bottom two.Peppermint came out and slayed!  Who knew she had all these jokes in her!  Every punchline landed, her energy was right, and her delivery was perfect.  Not since Destiny’s Child has a Michelle become so famous for riding someone else’s coattails.She definitely made up for that disastrous snatch game where I just wrote her off as a bubbly entertainer with nothing to say.Nina Bo'Nina Brown came out in character, which was very smart, because it forced her to speak more slowly and it gave her a funny place to launch from.  None of her jokes really landed, but she did give me my biggest laugh of the night when she looked at Fortune Feimster and, in her nice-nasty old Black Southern woman way that we all know, asked:What’s your name baby?I didn’t know either!  I had to look her up just now in order to get her name correct for this lil recap.Alexis Michelle’s Elphaba from Patterson New Jersey who didn’t paint her feet was the most uncomfortable thing I’ve seen on the show this season.  I don’t have to say anything.  You can just look at the reactions.Clearly she’s in the bottom, and though I’ve seen her live and it’s nothing overly impressive or exciting, Farrah is literally a waste of time and Alexis should easily out lip-sync her.Before the judges critiques, Valentina and Nina Bo'Nina Brown Earl Jones are both safe, which is totally acceptable.  They both landed like one good joke and that’s it.Shea is in the top because she opened the show with the right tone, energy, and laughs.  Sasha is in the top because she was able to show what a roast would like like from her very specific kind of POV.  Tamar said “she was really smart about being smart” which really is a breakthrough, because y'all know I thought her intelligence and intellectualism (<– actual word, I’m smart too, hoe) would ultimately defeat her.  Peppermint rounds out the top three because she had the best energy and the best jokes and none of them fell flat.  The judges say that’s the best she’s ever looked, but she looked like a very dated drag queen from a 2003 pageant to me so I’m not sure what curve they’re grading her on.None of Trinity’s jokes landed, so she’s in the bottom.None of Farrah’s jokes landed, so she’s in the bottom.None of Alexis’ jokes landed, so she’s in the bottom.Trinity got saved from the bottom two because she came out in a character that did manage to garner a few chuckles, so it’s Farrah vs. Alexis for the lip sync which was WIGGITY WHACK WHACK WHACK.  Alexis won, because look who she was going up against, but can we get into this lo-key shade from RuPaul toward Tamar?  Whenever a guest judge is a musician, the lip-sync done to something from their discography.  This season we’ve had Meghan Trainor and the B-52’s, but for Tamar’s episode, the lip sync was to Dolly Parton.  And let’s not say it’s because none of Tamar’s songs are recognizable enough since I for damn sure had never heard that Dolly song.  Plus, the last time Tamar was on the show as a judge, the girls faced off to Michel'le “No More Lies” and I’m positive the vast majority of the viewing audience has no idea who Michel'le is (or how to pronounce it correctly).The next time y'all have Tamar Braxton on the show, you better have a song queued up from her album.  I’m proposing “Catfish”or “Tip Toe.”Anyway, that’s that, and after this week, Sasha moves up for me once again.  She’s a lot more well-rounded that I gave her credit for at the beginning.5.

Anslinger is the root of marijuana legislation.  Anslinger worked for the Treasury during Prohibition and became the first commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics which was formed in 1930.  (Government note:  illegal narcotics – and alcohol back then – is enforced under the umbrella of the Treasury because they’re products which aren’t taxed and are therefore lost sources of revenue.)  Anslinger up until the 1930s said marijuana was not a problem and that any propaganda trying to paint it as a source of violent tendencies was absurd.  However, the government needed a new target once Prohibition ended and alcohol was legalized again, and Anslinger tied marijuana to Mexican immigrants and ramped up the propaganda campaign against it.  The federal government bought the lie that marijuana would make Mexicans (and Negroes) into violent savages coming to rape their white women, so marijuana was made illegal in 1937 and Anslinger was behind the first mandatory sentencing minimums – two to 10 years for your first possession.From the 1940s onward, research showed that marijuana didn’t cause any sort of “reefer madness” and in 1973, advisers made the suggestion to Nixon that marijuana be decriminalized because it’s safe.  Instead, he declared a war on drugs, which was actually a war on Black America and his political enemies.  The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.  – John Ehrlichman, Assistant to the President for Domestic AffairsSo that brings us up to date where marijuana prosecution is still a war on Black people.  Usage of marijuana is about equal in Black and white communities, but Black Americans are four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana.  Also, white people are more likely to use “harder” drugs, but marijuana – which causes no deaths, is used for medicinal purposes, is legal in many countries, and is legal in many states right here in this country – is still a schedule I narcotic alongside heroin.  Combined with the fact that marijuana makes up half of all drug arrests, and Jeff Secessions’ new directive to be tough on crime and roll back the Obama-era directives on prosecuting non-violent drug offenders means this is indeed war on Black communities again.Attorney General Jeff Sessions has a new directive for federal prosecutors across the country: charge suspects with the most serious offense you can prove.Friday’s announcement follows a line of several other significant departures from Obama-era domestic policies at the Justice Department, but this decision crystalized Sessions’ position in the criminal justice realm.“Charging and sentencing recommendations are bedrock responsibilities of any prosecutor and I trust our prosecutors in the field to make good judgment,” Sessions said Friday at a news conference in Washington. “They deserve to be un-handcuffed and not micromanaged from Washington.”In a brief one-and-a-half-page memo, Sessions outlined his new instructions for charging decisions in federal cases, saying that his new first principle is “that prosecutors should charge and pursue the most serious, readily provable offense.”“The most serious offenses are those that carry the most substantial guidelines sentence, including mandatory minimum sentences,” Sessions later added.(cont. CNN)Secessions is off the mark in every way, but two specific points.  Mandatory minimums are the definition of micromanaging from Washington.  He says prosecutors deserve to be un-handcuffed, but that would mean handing the discretion over to them when it comes to what charges should be on the table.  The related point goes in hand with those charges because the attorney general says the most serious charges are the ones that come with mandatory minimums, and that’s absolutely not the case, unless you’re basing your legal theory on racist propaganda from the 1930s that says marijuana is dangerous and causes violence against white women when we know that isn’t accurate.  If I steal $1000 or more, that’s grand theft, and the minimum sentence is usually 12 months of probation (though obviously you’ll get more time if you’ve stolen a lot more than $1,000).  If I’m also carrying marijuana, that could be a federal charge of possession with a minimum sentence of at least a year in prison.  Which one of those is more serious, the weed I want to smoke that doesn’t hurt me or anyone else or stealing property?  Attorney General Gump says the weed is more serious and he’s taken the discretion away from prosecutors to make that decision for themselves.Even more disastrous is the end to former Attorney General Eric Holder’s Smart On Crime initiative.  Holder and Obama realized drug possession is not always the marker of a criminal threat to society, so the goal of Smart on Crime was to reduce the number of felons behind bars for non-violent drug offenses.  If the accused had no violent criminal record, wasn’t tied to drug trafficking, and was not caught with a weapon or in the process of committing a violent crime, federal prosecutors were instructed to avoid any drug charges which would trigger a mandatory sentence.  Jeff Secessions formally put an end to that.  If you get caught with weed, you’re going to prison.  None of this matters to the blind apologists who answer any sort of judicial criticism with “if you committed a crime, you should go to prison, why are you trying to find ways to keep criminals on the streets.”  All arguments are lost on them, but some of them are your aunts, cousins, fathers, etc. so you can still try.  Put it simply.1) Weed is not harmful.  It’s an actual lie created by the government to demonize first Mexicans and then Black people.  That’s not a conspiracy theory – you can actually look up the words spoken by the people in power to make policy.2) The rate of usage for marijuana is the same for Blacks and whites, but Black people are arrested four times as frequently.  That means the police are targeting Black people.  Picture five white guys and five Black guys smoking a joint.  Four of the Black guys get arrested and only one of the white ones does.  That’s the actual statistic.3) The new attorney general is doing away with Obama’s efforts to mitigate that effects of policing prejudice.  He’s on the cable news circuit talking up evils of marijuana which do not exist and are based on racist propaganda from the 1930s.4) Being convicted of and then sentenced to prison for a crime that Connor isn’t even arrested for is one of the bottom rungs on a ladder of almost insurmountable hurdles toward equality in areas ranging from housing to employment.This is what happens when Coretta Scott King writes a 10-page letter against a racist but the country puts him in charge of the judicial system.  Let’s see what other ways he comes up with to make good on his racist history on the bench in Alabama."

Bills changing that have been introduced in the Missouri legislature for 19 years without getting much traction.“You can fire somebody for just cause if you find out they’re gay,” Engler said. “I think that’s sick. We should be disgusted we have that policy in this state.”Rep.

I’m gay today,” he said. “And it’s just a part of who I am.”But Rep.

Message every headless torso you find that says “masc vgl wm discreet 4 same” or some other iteration of such because, as a self-proclaimed expert in straight, closeted, bi-curious, or in-denial dick, I can see the faggotry in his eyes.Homophobes are almost always repressed gays.  We already know this.  And I’m telling you, Rick Brattin is the type of gay4pay amateur porn star that tells everyone how straight he is on Twitter every five seconds and then “retires” with some tacky interview about being tricked down the wrong path while praising some very average woman from Oklahoma named Rebecca Sue who saved him and brought him back to Christ…until he shows up 18 months later working for another gay porn site sporting different facial hair and a new tattoo.So.  Let’s start the countdown.  Somebody has nudes of him and just hasn’t realized he’s a homophobic politician.  Tell your Missouri gays to keep an eye open."

This is true for the simple reason that the Constitution is based on lasting principles of sound government that provide balance, stability, and consistency through time.

The radium basically destroyed them from the inside out to the point where some women walked around with handkerchiefs to soak up the constant seeping of pus and blood from their mouths while they picked out pieces of bone from their own jaw.And of course the companies responsible hushed up the results of investigations into radium poisoning, stole dead bodies before they could be autopsied, and repeatedly published false reports that working with radium was completely safe. Things didn’t begin to change until a man died, because obviously the women didn’t matter.With the report hushed up, the women’s biggest challenge was proving the link between their mysterious illnesses and the radium that they’d been ingesting hundreds of times a day. Though they themselves discussed the fact that their work must be to blame, they were fighting against the widespread belief that radium was safe. In fact, it was only when the first male employee of the radium firm died that experts finally took up the charge. In 1925, a brilliant doctor named Harrison Martland devised tests that proved once and for all that radium had poisoned the women.(cont.)  A perfect storm of capitalism and sexism led to unbelievably painful deaths for countless women and I had never even heard of this story.

The position of White House Chief Usher goes back to a time when someone would “usher” guests into the White House.

They are the head of the household responsible for every function it takes to run a mansion of that size and they oversee a budget of just under $20 million.It’s also a position that you don’t get fired from. You work until you resign for another job or until you retire. It’s not turned over with a change of administration and people have kept the position for decades, because running the White House as a home and public building is a detailed position wholly outside of the political arena.I think it’s just telling that Angella Reid got fired, ostensibly so Trump can appoint someone who he feels is loyal to him and not the position, someone he can trust not to write a tell all or leak his garbage behaviors to the press.

A federal judge on Tuesday blocked the Trump administration from enforcing a threat to take away funds from sanctuary cities – the latest blow from the federal judiciary to President Donald Trump’s immigration agenda.In his ruling, Judge William H. Orrick sided with Santa Clara County, the city of San Francisco and other jurisdictions, who argued that a threat to take away federal funds from cities that do not cooperate with some federal immigration enforcement could be unconstitutional.

That undermines the purpose of local law enforcement which exists to protect the people in their jurisdiction. Think of it this way: If you, as an undocumented immigrant, know that the police will deport you if they find out about you, you wouldn’t call the police when you or someone needed help. Mothers in domestic violence situations are especially vulnerable because they don’t want to be separated from their children so they avoid seeking help even though they’re being abused. The federal government can’t cut funding to local police when the police say “hey, we’re not going to assist your deportation efforts – that’s all on you.

Maybe this is widely represented in the progressive, ultraliberal bubbles I run in, maybe I just have a unique set of friends.

And because I remember a lot of these WPF foods growing up, and I remember exactly why we ate them: because they’re cheap as fuck. I compiled a list of every single specific food people sent me, and each one could feed a family of six for like five dollars. And they all were easy to make, too, because you really don’t want to spend a lot of time cooking (or washing a billion dishes after) when you’re trying to wrangle four kids and two dogs.

The gag is……this guy’s argument immediately defeats itself.  He  wants to define our hatred of White People Food among classist lines of “this is what poor white people eat” when soul food – the only great American cuisine – is based on scraps given to slaves who had to work to make food taste good.   White People Food, by definition, must not be Black People Food, yes?  But Black People Food *slash* Soul Food is poor people food and it’s one of the few culinary traditions that actually exists in this country.  I’m sorry none of y'all’s white ancestors took the time to make cheap ingredients into a culinary tradition that has spread around the globe, but it has nothing to do with class or access to better foods. Honestly…I don’t actually know why white people can’t cook.  (We already know that’s a generalization.  I don’t need you to send me your Grandma Susan’s recipe for Red Velvet Cake to combat it.)  But what I do know is this isn’t strictly an American issue and has nothing to do with class.  I don’t want to eat at your white friend’s house in the UK either – the food is too bland.  If you give me the choice between a French restaurant with a menu priced at X amount and an Indian restaurant with a menu priced at X amount, I’m going to choose the Indian restaurant.  Brown people make cheap food taste great.  You have to really come out of your wallet before you actually hit a quality level of French cuisine or English cuisine or German cuisine.So basically, white folks’ ancestors don’t have good culinary traditions for the average person (the Italians and the Greeks come closest, but there’s not a lot of variation in the ingredients).  The rest of us do.  So find another reason to cry about your unseasoned chicken breast."

Cummings (D-Md.) said they believe Flynn neither received permission nor fully disclosed income he earned for a speaking engagement in Russia and lobbying activities on behalf of Turkey when he applied to reinstate his security clearance. They reached this conclusion after viewing two classified memos and a financial disclosure form in a private briefing Tuesday morning.(cont.)So…Michael “Lock Her Up” Flynn didn’t disclose payments from Russia and Turkey before he applied for security clearance again. That’s a huge no-no, but if there’s no impropriety there and the payments were on the up and up, this could easily be smoothed over by making public the details of his travel, payments, engagements, and activities before and after Trump named him National Security Adviser, a position he had to give up when he was caught lying about other contact with Russia. You’d think the White House would want this all to go away.So the House Oversight Committee asked the White House for its information on Flynn, and the White House said “no.” They wrote a letter and basically said That Ain’t Your Business.Clearly there’s something to hide there. Can’t wait to see if former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates has anything to say about this, because you know she was fired for going against Trump’s Muslim ban and they’ve since tried to block her from testifying about his relationship with Russia. She definitely won’t answer any questions with That Ain’t Your Business." True link

If she had to just play the men’s circuit, it would be an entirely different story.”Williams responded on Monday evening, stating: “Dear John, I adore and respect you but please please keep me out of your statements that are not factually based.""I’ve never played anyone ranked ""there” nor do I have time. Respect me and my privacy as I’m trying to have a baby. Good day sir.“(cont. Telegraph UK) Tennis is one of those sports where men repeatedly feel the need to say to women ""ok you’re good, but you can’t beat me” as if letting her be good on its own is too threatening to your manhood.  I know this isn’t that important and John McEnroe has always been an obnoxious little shit but I do randomly want to make a few points about comparing women’s athletics to men’s athletics.One. Women are relatively new to sports.Women have always played sports, but for a very large chunk of modern history, it was more recreational in nature than competitive.  Women’t weren’t expected to put in the same amount of time, effort, and energy that men would.  Men have always been urged to express their masculinity and dominance through sport ever since we stopped beating each other up on the savanna to impress a mate.  That means when you compare women in a sport to men in a sport you have to take into account where the baseline is and women have improved far more than men in every area of athletics over the past century or so.  Check out this graph comparing the Freestyle Swimming world records held by men and women and note difference in times at the beginning of the last century and how much closer they are now.You can repeat that data plot in most fields and the trend is the same.Two.  Women have started to beat men in sports where strength isn’t as integral to the competition. Women & men compete against each other in equestrian events and women have beaten men in racing, dressage, show-jumping, and eventing.  Back in 2002, Pamela Reed won the 135-mile Badwater Ultramarathon against a mixed field.  Seven years ago a female bowler became the first woman to win a PBA tournament when Kelly Kulick beat 60 men in the Tournament of Champions. (x)  So you can see that any argument that begins with “men are better athletes” is solely based on strength.Three.  Men are physically stronger than women, so you can’t compare them.Mike Powell holds the long jump world record at 29 feet 4.25 inches and he’s 6'2.  If John Smith, who I clearly just made up for this argument, is competing in the long jump and his personal best is 29 feet 2 inches, obviously Mike Powell’s jump is farther so objectively, he’s the winner.  There’s no grey area there.  But if John Smith is 5'7 which means he clearly has shorter legs than a guy who is six inches taller than him, wouldn’t you say that John Smith is the better long jumper?  Mike has a physical advantage over John because he’s taller and he’s probably going to beat him every time, but inch for inch, John is doing more work and he’s the better athlete because he had a bigger obstacle to overcome.That’s how I look at men’s and women’s tennis.  Men are naturally more predisposed to build muscle so they are going to be stronger and faster.  In a game where strength and speed are paramount, the best man is going to beat the best woman.  If you really want to take the measure of the best man and woman, don’t compare them to each other – compare them to their competition.If I put John Smith against other people who are 5'7 and he blows them out of the water whereas Mike Powell barely beats other guys his own height, then John Smith is a better athlete than Mike Powell.  The same goes for Serena Williams.  There’s no man you can compare to other men’s tennis players who catch match the way Serena Williams compares to other women’s tennis players.  Serena Williams is the better athlete even if she can’t beat the best guy on the men’s side.Four.  Serena Williams is having a baby.And she won a tournament while pregnant.  Until some man does that, they can all have a seat in the back."

rafi-dangelo 162687728630 "2017-07-07 00:30:58 GMT" http://soletstalkabout.com/post/162687728630/is-there-a-line-between-cultural-appropriation-and "The Real Housewives of Potomac had their season finale Sunday when the Grand Dame of Who Cares About Northern Virginia had a party to celebrate her 20th Anniversary with her husband.  And it was Indian themed.A bunch of Black women in saris had the internet primed and ready to call them out for obvious cultural appropriation.  If you are not Indian, why are you going to a Bollywood party dressed like one?  You can run a Twitter search for “cultural appropriation” and “#RHOP” to find a lot of people who were upset about that party.I feel like I should have been upset too…but I wasn’t.  So now I’m trying to figure out where the line is between appropriation and appreciation.Let me just pause by saying I think the cast looked great.  Right or wrong, if you are going for Fancy Indian Outfit, the least you can do is go to an actual Indian clothing store and have the guy help you pick out stuff so you can show up and show out in your best light.  That’s what they did and he really did right by them.Anyway, I was in a little discussion about this online because this white girl named Amber on a Housewives messageboard said that it was such a double standard that this party hadn’t gone viral and that if white people did something like this, they’d be ripped to shreds.Pause:  White people regularly make money off of appropriating Indian fashion and culture – ex. every white girl pop star from Gwen Stefani to Mandy Moore.  It’s never more than a low buzz of distaste, not outright viral ripping to shreds, and this was just a party.  There’s no telling how many white people have thrown parties like this and gone unnoticed.When I pointed that out to her, her immediate response was that I’m Black and they’re Black so I’m trying to give them a pass, but when white college students throw ghetto parties the whole internet tries to get them expelled.  And THAT RIGHT THERE is why I’m less bothered when minorities throw well-meaning events appreciative of other minorities.  When white people do it, they have a tendency to revert to racist stereotypes that aren’t about celebrating and only serve to perpetuate harmful discriminatory practices in this white-dominant society. Too many white people don’t know how to maintain context and keep the conversation on the same playing field.  When a white girl says you can’t call her Becky because she can’t use the n-word, that tells you everything you need to know about her worldview and how she has no idea how to stratify discrimination.  That whole attitude immediately makes me want to defend this party, but let’s just take white people out of the conversation entirely.  Is this party an example of cultural appropriation or just awkwardly executed appreciation?  Well, according to how we define cultural appropriation, it’s still a mixed bag.First of all, cultural appropriation, like racism, is partly defined by a power structure that only works from the top down because there’s no way to enforce or institute prejudice from the bottom up.  A Black person not liking white people leads to white people getting their feelings hurt.  There is not now nor has there ever been a system in place to discriminate against white people.   A white person not liking Black people feeds into a system of legalized discrimination against Black people that we are still fighting against.  Cultural appropriation is the same way, so in a sense, Blacks and Indians in the US are on the same playing field as minorities in a white-dominant country.  However, culture and race are separate entities and they’re not interchangeable.  These Black women do actually hold the power because they get to participate in American culture to a greater extent than Indian immigrants.  It’s not that all Indians are immigrants or anyone from an Indian background is automatically on the outside of American culture looking in, but this party isn’t a celebration of Indians living in America being embraced by day to day American life.  This is a celebration of heritage from India.  Think of it like this:  The way these women dress day to day, because it’s a part of their culture as Americans, is far more acceptable in this country than the “culture” they’ve put on for this one night.  That’s the power structure.The other big part of cultural appropriation is colonial in nature.  Here comes the dominant culture sniffing around something created by a minority community to   make it palatable for the mainstream,   steal it,   denude it of any heritage, disrespect it, or a combination.  Iggy Azalea putting on a black-cent that couldn’t be further away from her culture to make southern-sounding rap palatable and fashionable for the mainstream because it’s coming out of a white girl is obvious cultural appropriation.  Those white girls in Portland who went to Mexico and spied on little old Mexican ladies so they could steal the recipes and open their own shop?  Cultural appropriation.  White folks using Black slang with no knowledge of where it comes from, and then eventually using it incorrectly is cultural appropriation – Bye, Felicia.  And wearing a Native American headdress for fun, whereas Native Americans themselves reserve that right for men with a certain standing in their society, is cultural appropriation.  THIS is OBVIOUSLY cultural appropriation.When Monique showed up and thought she was being cute by dressing up as a Native American Indian as opposed to the Bollywood theme, I wanted to throw a shoe at the TV because I actually liked her all season and I didn’t realize she was this dumb.  Nobody should be wearing feather headdresses anymore.  I thought we all knew better by now.For the rest of the ladies who followed the dress code, there was nothing colonial in nature about the party.  I don’t actually know if anything they’re wearing has cultural significance that shouldn’t be worn by anyone who isn’t a part of that culture like the Native American war bonnet, but any Indian folks can feel free to let me know if I’m wrong about that.  (Also of small note: If the Indian guy who dressed them didn’t let them know they shouldn’t wear something, the cast would have no way to know they were being offensive either).Possibly most important of all is the actual community that’s being portrayed.  If the community has said to everyone outside of it “Don’t do X because it’s cultural appropriation,” then that’s what it is and you can easily find something else to do.  Enough of the Native American community has told us not to wear war bonnets, so we shouldn’t.  Enough of the Black community has told Iggy Azalea to stop using our accent to sell her records, so she should stop.  I’ve never heard an outcry about wearing Indian fashion or throwing a Bollywood party (which is celebratory in nature and not the racist garbage being proposed by Amber and her ghetto bash).  The Real Housewives of Potomac certainly doesn’t have the kind of viewership to make it a cultural touchstone so it’s not like a ton of Indians saw it anyway, but the Internet can make any offense viral regardless of how many people experienced at the source.  If this party were truly offensive, I feel like we would’ve heard it by now.Anyway, this isn’t something I’ve ever put much thought into so any compelling argument to the contrary is welcome.  I don’t really care about anybody’s opinion but mine on a lot of stuff because I been sitting around actually researching it for months and years and I ain’t being shown something I haven’t already considered, but in this case, I’m not really stuck in this position.  Say whatever you want and it’ll just add to my greater edification on the subject and a possible restructuring of how I feel.One last thing I forgot: the reason I called it harmlessly obnoxious is I don’t think this party serves to perpetuate any harmful stereotypes the way some “culturally themed” parties do.  I do however think a bunch of bougie Black women going to an Indian-themed party because the host thinks foreign countries are exotic is hella obnoxious."

Shaub, Jr.Director(Twitter) I like how he italicized that one phrase in his letter – public service is a public trust – because this administration for damn sure cares naught about that.  Still, Shaub is a better man than me.  I woulda just straight up said “Y'all ain’t shit, I'ma go collect these coins elsewhere for a job where people actually listen to me.”Shaub did his best and, though I don’t know what his political leanings are, I have to believe he took a bipartisan approach to it since he started working for the OGE under Dubbya and was then appointed Director by Obama.  The fact that his term ended next year and he still couldn’t stick it out says to me that he was tired of pointing out the bullshit from the Trump Administration and being ignored.  I’d probably prefer working for an organization where my voice mattered too.Shaub, an attorney, has accepted a job with the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan organization of election-law experts.Thursday morning, Shaub told NPR that “the current situation has made it clear that the ethics program needs to be stronger than it is. At the Campaign Legal Center, I’ll have more freedom to push for reform. I’ll also be broadening my focus to include ethics issues at all levels of government.”He did not elaborate on what is so wrong with the “current situation,” but Shaub has been sharply critical of Trump’s approach to ethics compliance since the election.(cont. NPR)When ex-lobbyists were handed ethics waivers to work under this administration, Shaub requested they be made public.  His request was denied.  When Struggleanne Conway was on Fox News talmbout “go buy some of Ivanka’s crap” in direct violation of ethic standards, Shaub suggested some kind of punishment.  His suggestion was ignored.  When Shaub was blamed for holding up Trump’s cabinet appointees because he had concerns about ethics violations due to their extensive business dealings, he suggested maybe Cheetolini pick some candidates who weren’t so obviously beholden to their stocks and financial interests.  He was ignored.So Shaub is giving the finger to the foolishness and is taking a job with a nonprofit focused on voting rights and reforming campaign finance. Who is on the ground now trying (and failing) to keep President Velveeta in check?  I bet whoever gets picked to replace Shaub definitely won’t be quitting because they feel ineffective.  I doubt they’ll even show up to work."

The reason we don’t have a majority wins population based Presidential election is because the old white men who framed the country were smart enough to realize how stupid most people are.  That’s the bottom line.  They wanted to create a system to prevent the people from voting on passion and instinct against the greater good of the country.  James Madison specifically argued against a process where “mischiefs of faction” could sway an election, and by his definition, a faction is “a number of citizens whether amounting to a majority or minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.”  If that were to happen, it would be up to the electors to say hey…the people screwed up and we can’t let this happen. That’s what’s supposed to be taking place in our state capitals today.  If the Electoral College and our convoluted process toward electing a President was actually effective, the electors would be taking all of the facts into account and then deciding on the best course for America…which obviously isn’t Donald Trump.  Instead, the process has failed us twice.   Keep reading  Just wanted to remind y’all that the Electoral College is worthless and we’re in this mess because they didn’t do what they were created to do, which was protect the people from electing an idiot.Also, y’all’s arguments against dismantling it are worthless, namely that the President would be elected by two states: NY & CA.  Yes they have large populations.  No, everyone living there is not a Democrat, and if you go by party registration across the country, Republicans and Democrats are about equal.  Just because a lot of votes for the Democrat would come from densely populated areas while a lot of votes for Republicans would come from people living in empty spaces doesn’t mean anyone in any of those places had more say in electing the President.  The Electoral College actually does give some people more weight because their empty states get handed electoral votes disproportionate to the number of people who live there and then ALL of those votes go to one candidate even if 49% of the people didn’t vote for them.But keep in mind that it’s likely more people, especially people in solidly red or blue states, would actually vote if they felt their vote mattered.  In our current system, if you already think your area is going to vote for one and you wanted the other, you’re more likely to sit at home instead of waste your time standing in line because your vote will ultimately be tossed at the end of the day anyway.  " False text

She just wants to dance with somebody who loves her, and who can blame her?”How dare you.  Whitney was playing the pop star because she was out here breaking a mold.  There was no BLACK WOMAN whose voice was birthed and nurtured in the church who had ever been in position to utterly destroy pop music.  We all know what time it is.  White people get scared when you have too many opinions, especially back then, so the best way out is to just smile through it!“For her part, Houston does the best she can to keep up with the album’s dance-fever settings. On the first track, for instance, she carefully pronounces ”everything” as ”everythang,””Um…she’s a Black woman from New Jersey recording in Atlanta?  That’s just how we fucking talk?  Is she supposed to be enunciating for the Broadway stage?“Does it matter that I’m Your Baby Tonight is utterly without content, both musically and lyrically (”And in the morning when I kiss his eyes”)? Not really, if what you’re looking for is music with a shiny surface.”Excuse me, but every syllable of the title track is absolutely necessary.  ""Anymore"" is THE kiss-off track of 1990.  Did he miss the entire plot of “My Name Is Not Susan”?  Get your life.“Houston wants to be dressed up, paraded around, and supplied with ready-made things to sing and feel.”WHITNEY HOUSTON MAKES THE SONG WORTH LISTENING TO!  She turned the Star Spangled Banner in to a masterpiece of drama and theater!  She’s not being supplied things to feel – SHE BRINGS THE FEELING AND THE INTERPRETATION LIKE NO ONE ELSE CAN!“Sometimes you just want to lie in a lump on your couch and not bother. That way, you don’t actually have to feel anything, and you don’t risk getting hurt. While the rest of humanity struggles to cope with everyday trauma, Whitney Houston has it all figured out. D+”Y'all this absolute joke of a music journalist gave Whitney’s 2nd-best album a DEE PLUS.  And he went on to have a career for the next 27 years and is still out here reviewing music.  He is a CONTRIBUTING EDITOR to Rolling Stone and he didn’t have the ear, taste, knowledge, or prescience to recognize the greatness of Whitney Houston.  I’m never reading another review of anything ever in my life.  That whole industry is some bullshit and IDK why we let them influence the media we consume.  If the recommendation doesn’t come from someone I know whose taste I rock with, it’s going in the garbage. I really want to go beat this man’s ass.  I’ve never wanted to punch a stranger so badly in my entire life." True text

Rarely do we consider working with what we already have. Think about it: when was the last time you wore your hair as is? This season, we’re challenging you to embrace your hair and rock a style that works with your natural texture, not against it.Not convinced? Just take a look at the three POPSUGAR staffers ahead who have each come to love their unique hair texture over the years and revealed their tips for showing it off. Whatever your hair type, their relatable stories and gorgeous no-fuss styles will inspire you to rethink it the next time you find yourself reaching for a hot tool.(cont. POPSUGAR)  This article isn’t all that important, but look at the women chosen to “rock their natural hair.”Who thinks of these women when you hear the phrase natural hair? I just want to make a plea:  Women outside of the African diaspora, please stop saying “rock your natural hair.”  You can call it virgin.  You can call it unprocessed.  You can call it anything other than natural hair because that’s a movement for Black women.  I’m not saying this as part of an overreach of cultural appropriation accusations at all, because this has nothing to do with that.  This isn’t the n-word conversation where the answer to “can I say it too?” is always an emphatic NO! from the majority of people. And I have no problem with women of all backgrounds embracing the hair as it sprouts from their heads without the addition of heat or chemicals.  I support any trend where women aren’t doing damage to part of themselves to fit a beauty standard.But.  The women in these photos have never not been allowed to wear their hair without chemicals or damaging processes.  There has never been a point in history these women couldn’t just wash and go, even if that meant a wash and go with a hair band.  The hair types on these women are always acceptable in any business or social situation.  They’ve never been denied a job because of their hair.  They’ve never been told they’re aggressive or too political because of their hair.  Their hair has never been illegal.  (You can have a different conversation about countries where women have to cover their hair, but that applies to all women, not just women of a certain race, and it applies to all hair, not just hair that’s kinky, so the legality isn’t based on hair at all.)Black women rocking their natural hair has nothing to do with white women learning to manage their frizz.  Those are two separate conversations.  One is about actually fitting into society and the other is about managing a beauty standard that always caters to women who look like you anyway.  The natural hair movement is about re-teaching Black women how to care for their hair after all of that knowledge was lost to our people when we were dragged to this continent and forced to use sheep shears and banned from traditional African hairstyles.  Natural hair blogs and messageboards and haircare lines aren’t just educational resources, but emotional ones as well, where Black women can discuss their struggles embracing their natural kinks and coils in a society where the beauty standard for hair is the women in these pictures instead.  When non-Black women take up the charge of “rocking their natural hair” it dilutes the conversation and it makes it harder to connect.  There are way more non-Black women than Black women in this country and they will drown out the voices who needed the support the most if allowed to.So as a courtesy, find some other banner.  The natural hair movement wasn’t started for y'all or by y'all and it’s not as integral to y'all’s culture or survival.  So just use a different term.  Once again, y’all saw something cute and catchy that Black people were doing, wanted to capitalize on it, and whitewashed the meaning out of it.  Skipping your weekly blowout in the summer has nothing to do with taking the risk of being fired if you waltz into work without a mid-length sew-in and your coils on display instead.  Find another way to share white girl hair tips.  Please.Edit: I really don’t get what’s so hard to understand about this."

That comes out to be more than one gun for every adult.Half of those guns belong to just 3% of the adult population. These super-owners have anywhere between eight and 140 guns each, with the group average being 17, according to the study.Overall, there are an estimated 55 million gun owners in the U.S.: Most have an average of three guns; half own one or two guns; and the number of guns owned by Americans has gone up by 70 million over that same time period.(cont. Fortune)That’s all thanks to the NRA and paranoid gun people infecting the simple-minded with propaganda like this.  They love to say the Left is violent, the Left is dangerous, the Left is a threat to America, but our President never encouraged gun owners to shoot another politician.  The vast majority of mass shootings are committed by conservative White men.  Random acts of politically motivated violence are almost always rooted in xenophobia, racism, or religion on behalf of a straight white Christian who loves America.  And we don’t have any ads serving as a call to arms to protect ourselves against the demonstrably violent actions of the Right.I live in New York City and I will always live in a city like this, be it Los Angeles or San Francisco or Seattle or some other liberal bubble safely insulated from the paranoid red wasteland of the United States at large.  I think gun ownership is stupid and the Second Amendment makes no sense in a modern society having little in common with the daily life or political climate of the Founding Fathers.  But if I lived in a small city in Alabama or a rural area in Oklahoma, I’d have a permit and a gun, because crazy gun people are crazy.  It actually scares me that there are people who think this way and they’re out here stockpiling a hundred guns waiting for a reason to use them.  I don’t trust them not to instigate confrontation in a war wholly imagined inside their tiny little paranoid brains and I wouldn’t feel safe living anywhere near them.The fact that this video was made means the NRA knows it would be warmly and enthusiastically received by enough people to warrant the time and effort to create it.  I don’t feel safe next to those people and my thoughts are with all y’all who have to live and work with them."

But you shouldn’t have to be among the wealthiest of Americans to serve properly in Congress.”Chaffetz – who said he sleeps in his office whenever he’s in Washington – noted, “I flat-out cannot afford a mortgage in Utah, kids in college and a second place here in Washington, DC.”  (cont. CNN) That last sentence makes me want to throw America’s whole garbage ass into a fire and start over.   He can’t afford kids in college and a second mortgage while other families around this country can’t even afford rent in a cramped single bedroom apartment!  There are three easy ways Congress could fix this shining example of a first world problem if I’ve ever seen one and none of them involve a government handout.1) Rent an apartment outside of DC.The vast majority of the people who work in Washington DC commute from Maryland and Virginia because the money they make isn’t enough to cover the cost of living in a city center.  Go to Virginia and getchu a tiny studio for $1,000 a month if you need a second home.2) Make your kids work to pay their tuition the way you tell the rest of us to.  Why are you paying for your kids’ tuition?  That’s not teaching them good Republican bootstrapping work ethics.  Make them work for it the way y'all’s parents had lil summer jobs scooping ice cream.  True, that summer job no longer pays for tuition and your kids will have to work full time all year to try and make ends meet, but hey.  Y'all set it up that way for the rest of us.3) Downsize at home. Your kids are in college now.  I already know you have a big house in Utah because anybody this entitled definitely has a big house.  Sell it and get a small one.  You really don’t need all that space.  The overwhelmingly vast majority of this country survives on way less.The audacity of this guy wanting a handout so he can maintain a standard of living most of us have no way to mentally grasp is just astounding.  Go to the Wall Street Journal right now and put in your salary to see what percentile you’re living in.  This is Jason Cheesehead and every member of Congress (some actually make a bit more if they’re in leadership positions).That right there is why our politicians say you can just buy fewer iPhones to afford insurance or you can just go get a better job with better benefits or you can just stop buying fancy coffees and buy a house instead.  They have no comprehension of what it’s like to be an average American.  Never mind what it’s like to be poor, they don’t even know what it’s like to be middle class!  And the worst part is, most people making that much money feel like they’re middle class because America is a country where everyone is just waiting to get rich.  They’ll hit their break and get rich.  They’ll come into a large sum of money and get rich.  They’ll be discovered or rewarded or promoted and get rich.  Even the rich have dreams of getting rich because they have no idea how rich they are compared to most people.  Jason Chaffetz is trash and, honestly, so are most of our politicians because they’re making economic policy from the cushiony stability of trying to afford a second mortgage in one of America’s most expensive markets while the rest of us are trying to keep the lights on."

For a guy so intent on railing against the Fake News, ie all news that isn’t Fox, Breitbart, Infowars, etc., he sure does put a lot of stock in the approval of said news. It’s just like him and Hollywood – he wants their approval and then says they’re all sheep. I ain’t never seen somebody so torn between disdain and aspiration. He wants so badly to be accepted while simultaneously expressing his hatred for the establishment. I can’t even get my head around it.Oh wait, yes I can. He’s a fucking third-grader asking the cool kids if he can sit with them at lunch, and when he’s turned away, he throws a fit and says he never wanted to anyway because the cool kids are stupid."

Guys on major sites like those tend to resemble a gaggle of (mostly) white Ken dolls who look like they just met up in the dining hall of Aryan University after ultimate frisbee and decided to rub their naughty parts together.And that, at least studio heads seem to think, is what gay porn consumers want: mostly white, mostly hairless, mostly young bros. As a result, it’s no secret that there’s a major racial disparity in the gay porn industry; according to one tally by porn industry blog Str8UpGayPorn (a NSFW link if there ever was one), just 2.8 percent of Sean Cody’s lifetime roster of 1,024 models have been people of color. And though Sean Cody is the WalMart of gay porn, that studio is far from alone. Just like its dating apps, its media and its bars, the gay community’s porn is pretty racist.So why is black gay porn one of the most viewed categories on Pornhub, America’s most popular porn emporium (empornium)? And why is it that, across the country, most guys are seeking out anything but your standard twink?(cont.)I see these data “analyses” every year and every year they miss the obvious: When you look for gay porn, you don’t have to do a special search for white/masc/musc/mid-20s. That’s just the default.This study only measures what people search for, not what’s getting the most views. So yes, if you want to see something other than what’s presented, you have to search for it, but that doesn’t mean Black is the most popular gay porn in the South. It’s just the most popular category that people have to go looking for if they want something other than the standard fare.Devoid of a big population of non-white residents like the South (Black) or the Southwest (Latino), it defaults to special categories of white. The uptick in Black porn in the South isn’t a bunch of white guys jacking off to old Cocodorm clips and then ignoring Black guys on Grindr. There are some, but most of those views are from Black people because those places have huge populations of Black people. Same for Latinos. This isn’t breaking news or some big revelation into jacking off habits.  Most people are still watching standard white guy porn.  If it wasn’t making the most money, it wouldn’t be the overwhelming fave for studios to go to.The most exciting thing for me was that almost 40% of the gay porn clicks were from women. Find them for me because…" True link

But the reason the party has lost all four special elections is glaringly simple. It is not some deep and fatal malady afflicting its messaging, platform, consultants, or ad spending allocation methods. Republicans have won the special elections because they’ve all been held in heavily Republican districts.The special elections exist because Donald Trump appointed Republicans in Congress to his administration, carefully selecting ones whose vacancy would not give Democrats a potential opening. It feels like Democrats somehow can’t win, but that is entirely because every contest has been held on heavily Republican turf.(cont.)News: This Republican candidate, picked to fill a position left vacant in a Republican district when Donald Trump tapped that person for his administration, won their special election against the Democrat who was probably never going to win no matter how much money was spent.Democrats: OH MY GOD THE REPUBLICANS ARE WINNING WHAT ARE WE DOING WRONG?News: One of the reasons Trump picked so and so for his administration is because the history of the area they’re leaving is so heavily in favor of Republican candidates that it’s a pretty safe bet he wouldn’t be leaving a vacancy that a Democrat may be able to steal.Democrats: I CAN’T BELIEVE WE WERE UNABLE TO STEAL A SEAT THEY’VE HAD FOR YEARS AND YEARS IN AN AREA WHERE MOST OF THE PEOPLE SAY “BOOTSTRAPS” EVEN MORE THAN THEY SAY “I ONLY WATCH FOX NEWS.”News: This really says nothing about the prospects of next year’s midterm elections and the results are pretty similar to 2009 when vacancies left by Obama were filled with Democrats who won in heavily Democratic areas. Congress still flipped in favor of the GOP in 2010 as pushback against the new President.Democrats: WE ARE ALL LITERALLY GOING TO DIE TOMORROW.

Nothing was going to stop her.She’s a normal almost-teenage girl in Utah: She loves to draw and make art. When she grows up, she wants to be a Disney animator. Her favorite bands are Imagine Dragons and Fall Out Boy.On June 22, 2016, one day after her birthday, Savannah came out to her parents as lesbian.Mom had suspicions and knew that day might come.“I looked at her and said, ‘OK, I love you. And I’ll support you no matter what you do,’” said Heather, her mother.The family felt strongly that they didn’t have the right to prevent Savannah from telling her story publicly, including sharing it with CNN, but asked that their hometown and last names be withheld to give them a measure of privacy.After coming out to her parents, Savannah began the process of coming out to her friends and extended family.Six months later, she felt a calling.“I had a feeling like I should come out to the church,” Savannah said shyly. “I came out to all of my family and I just wanted to do something more.”  (cont.) Happy Pride Season indeed! I never *officially* came out at church, but my mama had the church leaders praying that I would be released from my homosexual demons so I guess I didn’t have to. I can’t imagine preparing a testimony and standing up in front of all those people to say “I’m gay, God made me this way, and I’m going to live openly and happily.”On one hand, I don’t see the point in trying to force respect out of a religion that wants you to suppress who you are. I don’t understand wanting to belong to a group that says some intrinsic part of yourself is fundamentally wrong. I pay them dust and keep it moving.But on the other hand, as an atheist I see all Abrahamic religions as fables and parables subject to changing interpretations wholly dependent upon time and evolving traditions in society. I think it makes no sense to say “this is the Word of God….but I’m going to toss the parts that I don’t like because they’re outdated.” Either God told you how to live, or He didn’t, but that’s a discussion for another time.Since church business of any ilk is really none of my business as a lovable heathen with complete disdain for organized religion, I can’t be mad at this lil baby lesbian. The first person to decide “wearing a cotton/polyester blend is fine even though the Bible says it isn’t” is no different from the first homosexual who says “God made me this way and I’m going to enter a same-sex union.” If she wants to be that person who tries to push Mormons toward full acceptance of homosexuals the way the first Christians decided bacon was too delicious to keep avoiding pork like their Jewish parents, then so be it. I’m proud of her bravery and visibility." True link

I was really focused on just this one group of women who were really isolated and weren’t prepared. A lot of slaves had left at that time, so they were really— that emphasized that they were cut off from the world. [Hallie’s] story’s a really interesting story, but it’s a whole other story, so I was really focused on these women.”The casts of Coppola’s six feature films so far — including The Virgin Suicides, Marie Antoinette, and The Bling Ring — have been almost entirely white. But Coppola said she’s more than open to changing that. “I would love to have a more racially diverse cast whenever I can,” she said. “It didn’t work for this story, but of course I’m very open to stories about many different experiences and points of view.”(cont.)I completely understand everything Sofia Coppola is saying.You can’t tell every story in every film. She picked this dynamic of white women isolated from their surroundings and adding Black women to the story would indeed make it twice as long and would’ve absolutely muddled the plot. There’s no way to tackle race within this context without making a completely different movie.Instead of having the only Black character in the movie depicted as a slave, Coppola chose to erase that character. I too am tired of the token character being the maid, the mammy, the slave, the butler, etc. so I understand her thought process.I understand why Beguiled is the movie that it is, but here’s my issue with Sofia Coppola. Don’t say that you’re open to diversity, you’re open to stories of women from different backgrounds, and you’re open to different points of view when you CHOOSE to make movies in this white woman-centric universe.There’s no way to cast The Bling Ring without a roster full of white women because the story is a true story based on a bunch of white women. You could add some more splashes of color to The Virgin Suicides, but again, that’s Detroit in the 1970s – how integrated do you think those friend groups were? The movies she directs do make sense with the casts she chooses, but the fact that she keeps choosing to helm projects for, about, and starring white women is most of the problem.The remainder of the problem lies in the fact that it’s so much harder to get stories from a Black point of view on screen, and making movies in settings where Black people were ever-present but telling the story from a white point of view that ignores all those brown faces is a double slap in the face. You picked a white story in a Black environment (the Confederate South, Detroit) and both your characters and your casting director ignore all the Black folks that come with the setting.Sofia, for all of her talk of wanting to be diverse, keeps going back to white women. She is a white woman. So I understand gravitating to those characters, though I feel it’s your responsibility as an artist to dig deeper than “these characters look like me so I can tell these stories.” But if that’s your mojo, just own it, and let people receive that truth however they may. Don’t pay lip service to change and pretend to be so open to diversity. Show me. Find more stories that speak to you outside of the same thin white woman’s point of view or just own that prejudice."

Guy A invites Girl and Guy B to his apartment for a threesome. Girl has a boyfriend (who wasn’t invited) and Guy B has a girlfriend (who wasn’t invited). At some point, one of the guys (probably Guy B) starts filming and Girl gets upset. Guy A – who lives in the apartment – drives Girl home to Staten Island, leaving Guy B in the apartment alone. Girl tells her boyfriend she was raped, though police say the threesome was consensual. Guy B’s girlfriend receives an anonymous Instagram message threatening Guy B. Something happens in Guy A’s apartment (he wasn’t back home from Staten Island yet) and Guy B stumbles out bleeding and being chased by three men.Guy B dies, Guy A isn’t a suspect, and Girl needs to be locked up as an accessory if she instigated this murder by claiming rape. What’s more likely? That one of the guys raped her during a threesome and she rode all the way to Staten Island with the other even though he didn’t protect her from being raped OR she was so pissed the guy filmed it that she made up a story for her boyfriend to both cover her tracks and make sure he got his ass kicked?I can’t wait to see this play out."
