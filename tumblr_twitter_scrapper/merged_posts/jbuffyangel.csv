I’ll talk about what I like about the move. Then we’ll shift to concerns. Keep reading  Wanted to provide a little bit of insight into the Upfronts and some context as to why Thursday is the most competitive/ “toughest” night on television. This might help some of you feel a bit better, but take it as you please.  If you’re not familiar with the intention of the Upfronts, the whole dog and pony show is not about consumers (though engaged viewers obviously get excited about the announcements that come from them), it’s about the advertisers. All of these presentations are about showcasing the programming schedule/ upcoming slate and innovative and cool things advertisers can get behind. It’s why the CW announced at their session that Supernatural will be doing an animated Scooby Doo! episode. It’s something that I’m sure excited advertisers because they know how well nostalgia and beloved IP performs (don’t be surprised if you see a slight uptick in Arrow’s ratings following that episode).  Within the next few weeks networks will start selling their ad space. The more excited and convinced you’ve made advertisers about each show, the more money they’re likely to spend on those ad spaces.  Here’s what the CW’s ad pricing chart looked like in 2016:  Arrow had the 3rd highest price point. It had a fairly decent decline, but so did The Flash. It will be interesting to see how it looks this year. The point being, Arrow makes the CW a decent amount of money (comparatively) in ad revenue.  As for Thursday’s … Thursdays are the nights most advertisers want to spend their money. Why? Because Thursdays are the last night of the week that the majority of people will be watching TV, before going into the weekend. Advertisers want to capture those audiences and inform their weekend purchases. Networks put their strongest shows amongst target advertising audiences and/or the best performing shows overall on Thursdays because this means they can charge more money per spot.  While Arrow may not be the strongest performer in ratings, I would argue it’s second to Flash (maybe third behind LoT, but probably not), in millennial male viewers (which for whatever ridiculous reason is still the holy grail of audiences to advertisers). So while it may not have the ratings people want it to have, it brings the audience so many advertisers want on the night that they want them and in a greater concentration than a show like This is Us. If you’re going to worry about any show at the 9pm time slot it should be Fox’s new show Orville or Thursday Night Football, because they’re way more likely to share the same. Now while The CW likely didn’t have any visibility into their competitors schedules, it’s safe to say they realized that while TNF might draw viewers away from Arrow, Arrow provides an alternative to the other shows at that hour. THAT’S the key to programming. In addition to what your needs as a network are .. the question also becomes: what audience is potentially being underserved at that time? Given the shift of This is Us on NBC with TGIT on ABC (which will be each other’s main competition) and two CBS comedies that always skew older, The CW has an opportunity to capitalize on a seriously underserved audience.  Other than that, I have different thoughts on the crossover…. As someone in content marketing, it’s my professional opinion that it would be tough to maintain momentum of a crossover event with a day in between. If you look at the ratings from last year, even with the crossover (mostly) spread across 3 nights, that third night (LoT) saw a drop-off in the ratings. Let’s be fair. It’s asking a lot of viewers and viewers these days are fickle enough. Granted the invasion storyline could have also been part of the problem, but I’d argue that the third (or last) installment is probably always going to see a drop-off. Because of this, I’d also argue you’d see even more of a drop-off if there’s a day in-between. But fear not… This means I see one of two things happening: The episode of the crossover event before Arrow will have a pretty great cliffhanger that provides a big enough incentive to come back two days after the last crossover episode has aired OR the network creates a special crossover event schedule. I think the latter is probably more likely. I see Arrow bumping Valor for that week to be positioned behind Supergirl and then returning to it’s regularly scheduled night the following week.   More extremely fantastic info. I am in love with you for finding those ad buy rates. I 100% agree with everything you wrote. Particularly about alternative programming. Arrow is third which isn’t too shabby, but my bet it’s probably cheaper to produce than The Flash too and Supergirl too. I agree that the break in the schedule does lose momentum and there will probably be a drop off in the ratings for Arrow’s night of the crossover. However, I still think they’ll get a bump and a bump is a bump. That’s only if they don’t do one of your ideas, which I think are fabulous and highly likely." False text

I’ll talk about what I like about the move. Then we’ll shift to concerns.What I LikeThe 9 pm slotPraise Jesus! We are on at a later time. THIS IS FABULOUS. Arrow has always been a darker and grittier show, especially when you compare it to The Flash and Supergirl. A 9 pm slot loosens the grip Broadcasting Standards and Practices has on the show. It can be more violent and sexier simply because the kiddos go to bed. I sincerely hope Arrow is able to push the envelope more, even if it’s ever so slightly.Supernatural PairingI do not watch Supernatural, but I am THRILLED Arrow was paired with it. These shows were paired before (2015 Arrow S4/Supernatural S11) and I believe it was successful. Supernatural and Arrow have very similar demographics, so they’ve always seemed like a natural fit to me.Honestly, how The CW pairs their shows has always been quite a head scratcher to me. Arrow and Frequency? HUH? The pairings for next year’s fall line up feel the most logical in years. The only one I’m really side eyeing is Valor after Supergirl (Really?). All the other show pairings feel similar in demographic and content, which just makes more sense to me if you are trying to maintain/build on audiences.Supernatural is a strong show. It’s been on 12 years. It’s moved 8 times. I think if God invented an 8th day and The CW moved it there but didn’t tell a soul, the Supernatural fans would find it. This fandom is as loyal as they get. Their ratings have held pretty steady over the course of 12 seasons, which in of itself is impressive. A move is always tough on any television show, simply because your audience needs to follow it to the new night. So, I am extremely happy Arrow’s lead in is an anchor show for the network, who has already proven themselves on Thursday nights, and comes with a built in audience that is similar to Arrow’s.Thursday NightThis is primarily for selfish reasons. I teach faith formation on Wednesday nights, but I am wide open on Thursdays. So, Arrow on Thursdays just works better for my schedule. lol I can live tweet more.The ConcernsThis Is UsYes, I am well aware that This Is Us is moving to Thursdays at 9 pm. This seemed to be the primary concern. That the live ratings mammoth that is This Is Us will send Arrow into a ratings death spiral and it will get canceled. Sigh. No. Just… no. Name one show on The CW that is in the ballpark of This Is Us numbers? Name one show on The CW that is in the live ratings ballpark of any show that airs on the Big Four? See, this is where this whole “How in holy Moses is The CW profitable?” question really starts to matter. It doesn’t matter what show The CW puts in that time slot. They’ll all get creamed. lol The CW isn’t concerned about Arrow going head to head with This Is Us. They don’t operate on a mano e mano strategy for live ratings… because they lose.This Is Us has to prove successful on Thursday. There can be a tendency for hit pilot shows to suffer a sophomore slump in ratings. This Is Us is moving to the toughest night on television. It has the break to contend with too when NBC starts airing football. I’m not really worried about any of this. I think This Is Us will do great and kick serious ass. I’m expecting every show that goes up against it will take a live ratings hit.Is This Is Us going to take enough of Arrow’s viewers to send it into some ratings death spiral so The CW is forced to cancel because it’s become abysmally unprofitable? Doubtful.I do think the shows target different demos as Mark Pedowitz said. Now before you start screaming at me, “I WATCH THIS IS US AND ARROW” that’s great. So do I. I love them both. Except, I’m not a Nielson family so it doesn’t really matter that I watch both. The CW’s demographic is primarily female. The reasons why Arrow and The Flash were so appealing to to The CW was because it allowed them to branch into the other half of the population more - the male demo. That’s who The CW needed to target for their market to grow. Now, before you start screaming at me, “WOMEN WATCH ARROW AND MEN WATCH THIS IS US” yes thank you. I am aware.  I am quite sure This Is Us will take some of Arrow’s audience, but this is not new territory for me. Blindspot was up against Arrow this year. It had to lose some audience to Blindspot given how similar the demos are. I’m not certain the demos are as different as Pedowitz claims, but he’s probably got numbers I don’t. The question is how much will This Is Us take? That is the X factor. I don’t have male/female demographics on either show, so how the shift all shakes out is unknowable.  Am I worried? NO.As I discussed in my most recent ratings post, I don’t know what the live ratings/profitability ratio is for The CW but even with a 30% drop in ratings Arrow is nowhere near their danger zone. The Originals is averaging a .30. It’s going into Season 5. Reign was at the same average when it was renewed for a fourth and final season. We’ve got a long ways to go. Arrow is still the #4 performer for the network.The CW is focused on streaming. Netflix kids. That’s where they make their money. The more seasons they have to sell to Netflix the more money they get to make. This includes complete series that viewers can binge start to finish. They also want their series to hit 88-100 episodes. They aren’t trying to make money off the live broadcast run. They are focused on syndication deals. Arrow has a syndication deal with TNT. This all means The CW is focused on LONGEVITY.Even if This Is Us sends Arrow into another ratings dive – I don’t think it goes anywhere. Stephen Amell is signed for 7 seasons. I feel confident we’re going 7 folks. Whether or not we go longer remains to be seen, but I think that has a lot more to do with Stephen Amell than it does with This Is Us. If Arrow ends in S7, I’m not remotely prepared to call that a series failure. Nor should you.The CW is trying to kill ArrowThere seems to be a concern that The CW is trying to kill Arrow by moving it to Thursday and putting it up against This Is Us. Thursday is not the night shows go to die. That would be Friday. (Jen pats Blindspot). Although, even that mentality is starting to change. I think The CW would rather move a low rated show to Friday, especially if it has a loyal fanbase and strong social media presence, instead of cancel it. Friday keeps many shows alive, which means more streaming opportunities!I guess the thinking on this one is because Arrow suffered a 30% drop The CW wants to cancel it and this is how they push it out. Again, I disagree. This is The CW not Fox. They try to keep series going, not intentionally torpedo them. Also, Marc confirmed that their streaming is UP. So, it’s possible whatever loss Arrow is suffering in live they are making it up in streaming. The audience is just shifting. We don’t have any specific numbers, but for all we know, this could be a wash. My bet is The CW is nowhere near as unhappy with Arrow’s numbers as people presume they are. Especially, if their numbers are up in the medium The CW is TARGETING.ThursdaySo why is Arrow getting moved off its comfortable Wednesday night show to one of the toughest nights in TV?  The Vampire Diaries was The CW’s Thursday solid 8 pm performer for years. They’ve always struggled to find a solid 9 pm. Nikita, The Secret Circle, Beauty and the Beast, Reign, The Originals, Riverdale – none of them cut it. Then once TVD moved to Fridays, Legends of Tomorrow failed to gain traction in TVD’s old spot.  You know what’s moved back and forth to Thursdays a lot over the years? SUPERNATURAL. Something I noticed - each one of these failed Thursday night shows were pretty buzzy their first season. Arrow generates buzz.Look guys, they had to put something there. The CW doesn’t have a lot of new shows this season which means one of the returning series has to move to fill up the slots. Supernatural proved successful this year on Thursdays. So, if you look at the board – Arrow makes the most sense to pair with it. Also, after 5 seasons, Arrow is still one of their strongest performing series (#4 ain’t bad). I think The CW put two of the longest running series, with a loyal fan base, to a night where they’ve been looking for two solid performers for awhile.I also don’t think WHEN The CW schedules their shows matters as much as other networks because, you guessed it, streaming.That said, Arrow did suffer a 30% drop this year. That’s not insignificant. Meanwhile, Supernatural had a minimal drop. Maybe the time has come for Arrow to stop being the lead in series and get a little support. I’m okay with that. Its certainly carried their own weight.Why not just put Supernatural on Wednesday like they did last year? Well, that still leaves Thursday as wildly problematic, but maybe the answer is Fox? Fox went with soapier programming this year on Wednesday with Empire and Star. So, I think The CW answered with Riverdale and The Dynasty reboot. That’s that’s just a guess though. I also think they wanted a new night for Riverdale. They seem invested in that series, the network just made an Archie comics deal, and probably wanted to find a more successful night for it than Thursday. Supergirl is a solid Monday performer. The Flash/LOT pairing is working great on Tuesday. That leaves Wednesday. And… Arrow suffered a drop. The door was open.Supernatural makes a bad lead inEhh… I just disagree with this. 12 years is a long time and I don’t have enough knowledge about Supernatural. I certainly understand if fans prefer Supernatural at 9 pm, but I think it has switched between 8 and 9 just as much as it has moved nights. I think Riverdale was sighted as this example. Honestly, I think that has more to do with my previous complaint about The CW’s penchant for terrible pairing. What on earth do Riverdale and Supernatural have in common? I’m not surprised the audience didn’t carry over. I don’t lay the blame at Supernatural’s door. I stand by my positives for Supernatural being the lead in.The CrossoverThis move breaks up the crossover. Honestly, I don’t think a network can plan their entire schedule around one episode a year. Also, I think the fanbases for the DC shows are pretty loyal. They’ll follow the crossover conclusion to Arrow on Thursday night. I don’t see a day drastically changing numbers, but I guess we’ll see. Even still, one episode a season does not make.I’m sure I’ve missed other concerns, but I took my best shot. My advice would be to stop worrying about Arrow’s cancellation and just enjoy the show - no matter what night it is on." True text

Emotional and action packed with zinging dialogue. What struck me most was how full circle it was. “Missing” sets up the heroes versus villains battle that will come to fruition in the finale, but it also kicks off the basic question Oliver must ask: What makes a hero? What makes a villain? Those concepts are not always rigid. In fact, the very essence of hero and villain is fluid.Oh… and did I mention there’s an Olicity reunion scene?Let’s dig in…Olicity and OTAThe Throwing Star killer is in prison and Oliver Queen’s approval ratings are in the 70th percentile. (That’s how you know it’s TV. If there’s a politician in my lifetime with that high of an approval rating I’m just assuming it’s the apocalypse.) Seeing both personas, Oliver and the Green Arrow, get the credit each deserves and Oliver being treated for the hero HE IS makes me want to run up mountains and sing songs.The battle is won. Let’s party.Quentin wishes Oliver a happy birthday because heart strings. Source:   olivergifsDid y'all notice the size of that gift? Think about where these men began and where they are now.  What I love about Oliver and Quentin is how similar they are. Both men are hard shells, but once you crack it it’s nothing but ooey gooey center. Oliver has earned Quentin’s respect, trust and forgiveness. Quentin sees Oliver as the honorable man he is and put a motherf*****bow on it.  IT MAKES ME FEEL THINGS Y'ALL. Thea and Oliver take a minute to recap her emotional trajectory.  They recall the last time Arrow celebrated a birthday - Thea’s 18th birthday. Do you remember? It was a lifetime ago. Thea got a new car, did some Vertigo and crashed it. Good times.But it led to THIS!!!!!I miss Roy.Anyways, Oliver talks about how far Thea has come because he reads my mind. Thea laments that she doesn’t think she’s come quite far enough. Oh… my sweet honey child. Let the pain go!I am all ready to give Thea a pep talk, but Oliver “I Am 32 And Emotional Evolved” Queen steps up to the plate.

Now go get your girl.Thea wants to take Oliver out for his birthday. QUEEN SIBILINGS FOREVER. Oliver has plans. Oh? You don’t say?“Please say not Susan Williams.”Thea summed up Susan William’s entire character arc for me in a single sentence. And did I almost see a shudder come from Oliver? Perhaps it’s wishful thinking, but he at least gave a good awkward stammer.  In fact, no dear sister, dinner is with Felicity Smoak. You know, the human equivalent of a rainbow, forever light of Oliver Queen’s life, future mother of his children and your nieces and nephews. That Felicity Smoak. As for Susan Williams, come Thea girl, pull up a chair because you have MISSED THINGS. Particularly the glorious break up in which Oliver dumps Susan’s ass because, once again, he’s not sure he can have a relationship and be the Green Arrow. Meanwhile, Felicity asks him over for dinner and homeboy falls over himself sprinting to the loft, but that’s just details. I totally believed him about Susan. It was all concern about safety, balance, blah blah. Nothing to do with the urge to chew his arm off post coitus.I’m sorry. The snark just flows.

It’s not a date. Maybe it’s a date.  Could it be a date? Dear God, let it be a date. Oliver is praying to the higher power like Are You There God? It’s me, Margaret.Thea doesn’t believe him. Nobody believes you Oliver. You lack zero chill with Felicity. The heart eyes run deep my friend. Just embrace it.

There’s a Green Arrow with the #6 the arrows in the target - a celebration for their Season 6 renewal of course. Take that haters! Don’t bitch at me about ratings. Seriously. Enough. The explanation for the 6 is Felicity ordered the cake for a six year old. She thought a Green Arrow cake for a grown man would raise alarm bells. That… makes a lot of sense actually. Our girl is so smart.So why is Arrow celebrating Oliver Queen’s birthday now after all these years? It’s not simply because there’s a lull in the action. This is about how far Oliver Queen has come, especially in these last few episodes. When Oliver came home he wanted to keep everyone he loved at arm’s length. He shut down the very essence of who he is, his humanity, because Oliver  believed it was required to protect those he loves, save the city and honor his father. In the end, Oliver discovered the exact opposite was required to be the Green Arrow. He had to open himself up to familyfriendshipand love to become someone else… something else. That’s how he took the darkness used it for light. It hurt. A lot. Oliver has been to hell and back. He’s faced the very worst parts of himself and came out the other side. Oliver has learned to honor truth over lies, team work over control, love over loneliness and forgiveness over self hatred. These past five years, Oliver has learned how to choose home over the island. He’s not just surviving. Oliver Queen is living. I cannot think of a better way to celebrate that evolution than his 32nd birthday. Oliver has been reborn.

Love isn’t always marked by a lot of fan fair. Most of the time, it’s the quiet moments that define you. The moments when you look into the eyes of the person you love and say yes.

Not ever again.Oliver stumbles at the word date, his nerves getting the best of him, and I believe he didn’t want to put too much pressure on Felicity. However, this is a man who isn’t afraid.  This is open and honest communication. He doesn’t hide what he was hoping dinner meant. Oliver is charging through that door Felicity opened in 5x20. And Felicity, so sweetly and with a gentle little wink, confirms Oliver’s hope because it’s her hope too.  Felicity says yes  to trying again, but slowly. There’s no rush to the altar here. She wants to be sure they are solid, so they never break up again. That means taking things slow. A walk under the stars, hand in hand, one step at a time, together.This exquisite, beautiful, warm and loving light lives in Oliver Queen and Felicity always harnesses it. I often say Oliver Queen is the sun the other characters revolve around. With Felicity’s answer, Oliver becomes pure sunshine.And there it is. The moment David Ramsey promised at HVFF. The moment Marc confirmed we were building towards in July. A simple, quiet, open, honest, forgiving, and most of all loving, yes. This is how you repair what is broken. This is Olicity rebuilt.I was so happy with 5x20. It was everything I ever wanted from Oliver and Felicity for the past five years. Whatever came after was always just going to be icing on the cake for me. What I love about this moment is how builds off of everything 5x20 established so perfectly. The moment Oliver celebrates his life with his family, he and Felicity decide to start their lives together again. If I’m being honest, it’s satisfying AF. This moment is EARNED y'all.Cause even underneath the wavesI’ll be holding on to youAnd even if you slip awayI’ll be there to fall into the darkTo chase your heartNo distance could ever tear us apartThere’s nothing that I wouldn’t doI’ll find my way back to youFelicity senses Oliver isn’t quite at ease and questions him about it. Oliver immediately leaps to the conclusion that she’s talking about them (because that’s all he can process right now) and jokes about dating his ex-fiancé. THIS CUPCAKE. He’s so scared to put an official label on it, but he wants to so desperately.No Oliver, you love sick fool. It’s not hypothetical. This is real. Embrace the joy my friend. She came back to you.I expect the fandom to abuse this gif.  Source: gothsmoakOliver learning how to relax while being the Green Arrow is still a skill he has to master (*cough*fivemonthtimejump*cough*) and I love how Felicity encourages him to chillax - bad socks and all. So let’s talk about the tie loosening. I refuse to see that as anything but Felicity beginning to undress Oliver right then and there. Coupled with night under the stars and eye sex, Source:   olicityloyaltyI feel it’s pretty clear where Felicity thinks the next step should be.Alright, it’s pretty clear where I think the next step should be.I’m not going to argue that Oliver doesn’t frequently need his bottle uncorked, but he also has great instincts. These instincts kept him alive for the last ten years, they are almost other worldly. They also make him a pain in the ass too, but overall his instinces are helpful. Oliver knows something is up in his gut. It’s no different than feeling a rocket a hair trigger before it explodes or someone sneaking up behind him. But he wanted to believe. Oliver wanted to war to be over, to be happy and just live so he let his guard down.  He ignored his gut.The gun scene was as adorable as I hoped it was, but I wasn’t anticipating yet another emotional reconnecting moment between Oliver and Felicity. Dinah and Curtis are gone and Felicity is rightly concerned about the League of Assassins. They be crazy. So, our girl is ready to hunker down and operate comms remotely. Oliver’s response signals just how far he’s come and how much he’s grown.Source:   oliverxfelicityFelicity stays put. Right next to him. Exactly where he can see her. Didn’t you love the part where Oliver reassures bae that Talia Al Ghul and her LOA flunkies can bring it? Oliver will handle business. Felicity doesn’t need to be afraid. He won’t let anything happen to her. Confidence is so sexy in a man.Oliver knows he needs Felicity by his side if he has any chance of stopping Chase. He’s not pushing her away. He’s not trying to handle everything on his own. Oliver is admitting he needs Felicity’s help. He needs HER. It seems Oliver isn’t the only one looking for a little firmer confirmation on status. Felicity wants to know if Oliver’s motivations are simply tactical or is there a little more to it? Girl… you are his lobster. Come on now.Source:   oliverxfelicityOliver immediately tells Felicity the truth which is OF COURSE it’s not just tactical. Oliver ignored his gut and not only is his team in danger, but so is his son. Source:   klarolicityswan   I love how William is just an open, honest and natural subject for Olicity now.  Felicity tries to reassure him, but Oliver rightly corrects her out that while her assurances are appreciated there’s no way either of them can know for certain if William is safe. And since Chase is crazy pants, Oliver feels it’s highly unlikely that he is. (Gotta trust those parental instincts Oliver. They are seldom wrong.) Essentially, Oliver is telling Felicity that by allowing those he loves out of his sight made them vulnerable to Chase. He will not make that mistake with her. HE. WILL. NEVER. LET. HER. GO. AGAIN. Y'all I am emotional.Except… then Quentin and Thea are taken. What follows is yet ANOTHER emotional scene not only with Oliver and Felicity, but with Diggle. Oliver finally realizes that Chase is taking away his strength, his team, to leverage his freedom. Oliver wants Diggle and Felicity to get out of town, which is meant with strong opposition particularly by Diggle. John will not abandon Oliver, but Oliver doesn’t look at it that way.  Chase is slowly picking off Team Arrow one by one. Felicity and John are the only two left and they are the foundation of the team. Oliver operates on instinct, but he fears that instinct is what is putting Diggle and Felicity in danger.  Oliver depends on John and Felicity. If Chase threatens them, and he will, Oliver’s instinct is to pull Diggle and Felicity close. His instinct was to send Thea, Quentin and William away. His instinct was to allow Curtis, Rene and Dinah to operate business as usual. Every choice, every instinct, Oliver has followed Chase has used against him. So, Oliver is mixing it up. He’s going to directly opposite of what his heart tells him to do and send John and Felicity away.Felicity doesn’t want to leave. She’s worried about Oliver. So, now it’s time for Oliver to reassure her. If he’s not worried about her, then he can focus on Chase and finding the others. If Felicity leaves then he’ll be safer. This argument proves how well Oliver knows Felicity. She won’t put her safety above Oliver’s, but she will listen to him if she believes this keeps him safe.Source:   tinaday3wBut even then, neither of them wants to let go. They hold hands like they’ve done many times before, as circumstance forces them to separate, their eyes conveying everything they are feeling in the moment- that be apart is the last thing either of them wants. Source:  gothsmoak The problem is, Chase wants Oliver to doubt his instincts. He wants him to rethink everything that feels right. As Diggle and Felicity are driving away from the city, Felicity’s instincts tell her they were wrong. They’ve over thought this. They should have never left him alone. SHE should never have left him.Felicity’s right. She’s always right. A LOA flunkie shows up with two swords which leads to a hilarious Delicity moment as they recall their encounter with Isobel Rochev. Source:   westallenolicitygifsEmily Bett Rickards and David Ramsey’s comedic timing is always stellar. I need more. All the time more.Unfortunately, car versus murderous woman doesn’t go exactly like it did with Isobel Rochev. Diggle and Felicity’s car crashes and then IT EXPLODES. Not gonna lie, I screamed many screams. DO NOT DO THAT TO ME MARC GUGGENHEIM. THOSE ARE MY CHILDREN. WE DO NOT BLOW UP DIGGLE AND FELICITY’S CAR. THERE ARE RULES ABOUT THAT SORT OF THING.But they are totes fine, so I could breathe again. I mean… they aren’t ever going to kill these two, but I’ll never be okay with the threats of it. Unfortunately, Diggle up against several LOA members isn’t a fair fight even with those bowling balls for arms. Diggle and Felicty are taken… and Oliver is left to fight Chase and save everyone he loves alone.Source:   legends-of-todayOR IS HE ALONE?Malcolm MerlynMy hatred of Malcolm Merlyn runs deep. Primarily because Malcolm sees himself as the hero and not the villain. This began over love for Malcolm. He was once a good and loving husband and father. Losing Rebecca shattered the man Merlyn was and he forged himself into someone else… something else. Love beget grief. Grief beget revenge. Revenge beget a lust for power. At every turn, Merlyn has operated in his own self interest, but firmly believed they were righteous and for the greater good. Merlyn unleashes evil and believes it is love. That’s the level of sociopath we are dealing with here.Merlyn is the reason Robert Queen died. He’s the reason Oliver ended up on that island. He killed Tommy. He used his OWN DAUGHTER as the weapon to kill Sara Lance. Merlyn sent Oliver into a death trap into Season 3 to save his own hide. He put Thea in Ra’s Al Ghul’s cross hairs, which is how she wound up on a ventilator. Merlyn served William up to Damien Darhk like cheese and crackers. He was an active participate in Laurel’s death (I’m not really mad about that though, but let’s just add it to the list).All of these crimes have gone unanswered on Arrow. Essentially unpunished. Sorry folks, a hand doesn’t cut it for me. Ha! Cut it. Get it? There’s a reckoning coming Malcolm Merlyn and it is long past time.We haven’t seen much of Malcolm Merlyn this season and I think it was a wise choice. The character, in my mind, is the new LL and has run his course. If they are bringing him back then it needs to be for an intended purpose and Arrow made that purpose wildly clear.Merlyn has been busy this year though - on Legends of Tomorrow as part of the Legion of Doom. He partnered with Damien Darhk and Eobard Thawne to alternate time and change the world to their liking. However, I was always struck by what that meant for Malcolm. Both Damien and Eobard were after power essentially, but not Merlyn. His altered reality meant Rebecca and Tommy were alive and Thea adored him. He’s still Merlyn though - he got revenge on Nyssa Al Ghul by making her life a closeted life in Ohio. Malcolm admitted to Sara however what he was searching for: a clean slate. He wanted all his mistakes, the pain and the death that came with them, jus wiped away. He didn’t care if it wasn’t real. What Malcolm wanted is redemption without the sacrifice. So, this redemption arc was kicked off but if you weren’t watching Legends then you didn’t see it. Except, what does redemption really mean for Malcolm Merlyn? Is it really achievable? Yes, I think redemption is possible for all characters, but the desire has to be there. The willingness to make a sacrifice is what counts. That’s why Merlyn’s arc on Legends ultimately failed. He wasn’t willing to do what is necessary to really make amends.What is necessary isn’t erasing all that he’s done. It’s facing it. It’s making a different choice. Essentially, that’s the only difference separating a hero from a villain - choices. It’s why it’s such a fluid concept. A hero can become the villain as easily as the villain can become the hero. While I  doubt I will ever be able to call Malcolm Merlyn a hero, I do believe Arrow is setting him up to make a sacrifice. Which is the essence of heroism and what is required for redemption.Source:   zorro-ritaBut first we gots to hash out some issues. Oliver and Merlyn go toe to toe over a lot of things, but first up is William. Oliver is still pretty ticked over Merlyn handing his son over to Damien Darhk. Oliver used his angry voice talking about his son. It felt warm suddenly.Merlyn’s concern is Thea. Malcolm never loved Tommy the way he should have. Tommy was never more important than his revenge. He rejected Tommy in every way. However, Merlyn’s arc on Legends finally showed a desire to go back and change that, which we never saw before. Merlyn is prepared to do what is necessary to save his daughter. Even if it means helping his enemy. And Oliver isn’t exactly in a position to refuse his help. I know some may have issues with Oliver teaming up with his enemies like Malcolm Merlyn and Slade Wilson, but I love it. It’s incredibly full circle. Oliver has spent years building this family. It’s pretty fantastic that to save his family he must work with all the villains who’ve tried to destroy it over the years. Oliver and Malcolm have it out giving into Chase’s demands. Merlyn is flabbergasted that Chase even needed to take Felicity and Diggle. He felt Thea was sufficient motivation.  He’s prepared to do whatever is necessary to save his child - a concept Oliver should be more familiar with now that he has William. However, Oliver’s concerns run deeper than Chase not holding up his end of the bargain (something Merlyn is an expert it).  Once again he worries that his personal connections are making him vulnerable. He has to become something else to protect them and he will never be free of it. Oliver will never be free of the darkness.  And here we go again. This is an old tune from Oliver Queen. I won’t harp on him too much. Chase did manage to take everyone he loves, so I’m not entirely shocked Oliver has a brief moment in which he reverts to form.Source:   dailydcheroesThis might be the single greatest line Merlyn has ever spoken and one of the truest things ever said about Oliver Queen. My precious big dumb oak tree.Merlyn: Human connections are what keep us human. It is sad that it’s a sociopath who is gonna have to point this out to you. You can’t live on an island Oliver. You’ve already tried. You are always going to have people in your life, Oliver. They will always need you. For better or worse. Baggage and all. And if you can’t accept that then your past is going to stay your anchor. Round. Of. Applause. I hate the bastard, but when he’s right he’s right. It sounds completely out of character for Merlyn, but does make some sense given his arc on Legends. Merlyn pushed away human connection after Rebecca died and he has FINALLY learned the cost for those sins. If Oliver wants to beat Chase, and Merlyn’s goal is to beat Chase in order to save Thea, then both of them have to do things differently - but especially Oliver. He’s tried it the other way before. Oliver tried to go it alone. That “something else” never quite measured up into what was needed until he let people back into his heart. Until he allowed his humanity back in. There will never be a time where Oliver doesn’t have people he cares about. He cannot shut off. He cannot isolate himself. He will lose. This much is fact. Nor can he allow the darkness to take the driver’s seat. Oliver will lose the part of himself that makes him human - everything Diggle, Felicity, Thea and the team love about him. Then he’ll be left alone again. It’s a cycle. The only way to break it is to become SOMETHING ELSE. Be different. Embrace his humanity. Hold to those connections. That’s how he wins.And really, nobody knows this better than Malcolm Merlyn because doing the direct opposite is how he lost everything that mattered. Malcolm Merlyn is the one who sent Oliver to the island. So it’s fitting that he is finally helping Oliver get off it. All it takes is a different choice and the villain can become a hero.Even Malcolm Merlyn is rebuilding what he broke, which means… Malcolm Merlyn is going to die. I am absolute on this. They’ve set it up perfectly, what’s more, I believe it needs to happen. Thea is still holding on to the fear that she’s a monster - just like her father. What greater gift can Merlyn give Thea than by showing her the monster of her life can choose to do the right thing? Merlyn’s death pays the price he’s always avoided. It also may be the very thing Thea needs to be free from the past and find hope in herself again.WilliamWilliam plays an extremely integral role in “Missing” because, as Oliver explains:Source: olivergifsArrow was never about one thing. It was never just about LL, L*uriver , Olicity or OTA. I think no matter which spectrum of fandom we’re on, if we only focus one or two segments of the story then it leaves the potential to miss very important pieces that ultimately feed the segments we care about. Arrow, at its core, is about family. This story began with a father and a son. We are here because of Robert Queen’s sins and because of the love and faith he had in his son. For ten years, Oliver has been struggling with his father’s legacy, what his dying wish truly meant and the guilt of Robert’s death. Oliver shouldered the weight of Robert’s sins while being weighed down by his own. The next step in Oliver’s evolution is to no longer just be the son. He must become the father. The point of the legacy theme is to rebuild what was broken so many years ago. Oliver’s mission cannot be only focused on Robert Queen anymore. It has to grow beyond the past and look to the future.William.Oliver is right. William is the purest part of him. He retains the innocence Oliver lost all those years ago on the boat. More than anything, Oliver wants his son to keep that innocence. He wants him to be safe and untouched by the darkness both Oliver and Robert have battled. But no matter where William is, he will always be Oliver Queen’s son.  He will always be Robert Queen’s grandson. William will always be part of this family and part of this cycle. If Oliver wants to break it, if he wants to save William from paying for his sins (like Oliver paid for his father’s sins), then he has to become someone else…. something else.   Source: olivergifsThis scene is heartbreaking. Stephen Amell makes me feel all the feels. All Oliver wanted was to keep his boy safe. To make sure William never became like him. Chase took that away. So, now William is the one on the boat. He’s trapped in a world he doesn’t understand and paying for sins that are not his fault. Robert tried to stop it. He tried to protect Oliver from his sins. He failed. All Robert could offer Oliver in the end was the chance to survive and to do it better.This is the another chance to do it differently. To do it better. Maybe the most important chance. Oliver can no longer be mired down in the past.  Source: olivergifsAdrian Chase is the dark mirror to Oliver. He is what Oliver can become if he never lets the past go.  Every step since 5x17 has been Oliver letting go of the pain, guilt, shame and anger. Every moment has prepared Oliver for this battle. For this choice. Oliver has to hold onto the lessons he’s learned, what he knows to be right and allow his humanity to make the calls. Oliver needs William as much as he needs Felicity. As much as he needs Diggle and Thea. This is the love that pushes Oliver past the dark into the light. This is the love that makes Oliver fight for the future.  Oliver’s love for William makes him a better man and a better hero. A man and hero worthy of Felicity Smoak. Source:   sharingmyworld It’s why Oliver is willing to work with Malcolm Merlyn and Slade Wilson. The past no longer matters. All that matters is his future and he’s willing to whatever it takes to protect it. Oliver also knows to win, to truly save his son and everyone he loves, he has to do it differently this time.Source:   olivergifs  I think this flashback actually foreshadows Prometheus’ demise. Oliver won’t kill him, but I don’t think Chase will have the stones to face justice. He’ll do what Oliver refused to do. Chase will kill himself.  Bl*ck Sir*n and Quentin LanceOkaaaay she’s back. Truthfully? Pretty minimal scenes. She kidnapped Quentin and Thea. The end. Although, I do enjoy KC as Bl*ck Sir*n. She plays a good villain. And Paul Blackthorne’s reaction to seeing “Laurel” was out of this world. Break me into a thousand pieces sir!There’s certainly an effort to add some layers. BS owes Chase and wants to protect Quentin, so… she kidnaps him? The promise is Chase won’t hurt Lance. Had me a nice chuckle when Lance called her stupid. BS gets to express some “she’s not all villain” emotion. BS says it’s equally hard on her to see Quentin as it is for Quentin to see her. So… this probably means Quentin is dead on Earth 2. Okie dokie.Are we headed for a redemption arc? Eh. I don’t know. Honestly, the reason Arrow says they brought KC back was because they enjoyed her performance as BS. I know the LL fandom wants Arrow to turn Laurel 2.0 back into Laurel 1.0 but the reason Laurel 1.0 died is because the character ran her course. So, there’s no need to retread that old ground. Also, Laurel 2.0 is not Laurel 1.0 so can we just accept reality? The best thing Arrow has going for them with BS is that she is a villain. This plays to Katie’s acting strengths and gives Arrow new ground to explore. I truly don’t think they are in any rush to evaporate these positives.FlashbacksYAO FEI!!!!! Oh Yao Fei how I missed you. I don’t even care that you were a manifestation of Oliver’s guilt and urged him to commit suicide. I will take some Yao Fei anyway I can get it.Imaginary torture. Well, that is one way to go Kovar. I’ll give the guy credit. He did have Oliver’s number. Emotional pain is far more torturous to Oliver than physical pain. This results in a series of flashbacks to remind us all that the past five years were of the suck for Oliver. Yeah, I didn’t really forget that.I like that Kovar gave Oliver a gun to commit suicide. Oliver killing himself is ultimate defeat and that’s what Kovar wants. It’s also a very nice callback to Oliver’s first few days on the island. This isn’t the first time he’s considered suicide.But then Oliver hallucinates Laurel. Well look at that. Flashback Ollie actually remembers Laurel! Better late than never I guess. They have to connect it with the pilot. Oliver has to give a crap about Laurel again, so Arrow took a break from all the Felicity foreshadowing in the flashbacks.  It’s fine. We all know where their “love story” goes.Oliver envisioning Laurel as his hope and salvation, begging him to come home when in reality he gets this when he does come home basically sums up this hot mess of a television relationship for me. Those were dark days my friends. Glad they are behind us. Huh. Snark is full on. KC being back might be fun after all.Stray ThoughtsLyla has a sister. Huh. Cool. Diggle’s reassurance to Oliver (aka US) that Dyla is okay is appreciated. Kovar nailed the Catholic belief on Purgatory.  Wave to me from heaven y'all because that’s where I’ll be for awhile.Oliver’s attractiveness in his attractive brown leather jacket is very important to me.Only Josh Segarra can look threatening in that color of yellow.Quentin Lance trying to process how messed up it is that LL has a doppelganger is so me. Malcolm hand jokes never get old.“Not yet but soon.” Josh Segarra added another level to the Chase creepy factor - this sounded exactly like John Doe from Seven Deadly Sins. I still have nightmares about that movie.Source: kendrasaundersI’ve missed this goddess.Call back to Legends of Tomorrow! Ra’s told Nyssa where to find Sara because Sara told Ra’s to tell Nyssa where to find her. Let that little time loop simmer on ya for a minute. Although, I’m confused. I thought in S2 Nyssa found Sara in a market place starving. I need a Sara Lance/Nyssa Al Ghul flashback episode like yesterday.Source:   sharingmyworld They all arrived by plane. Interesting. Methinks that Chase is planning on eliminating those means on escape. Perhaps, he expects to leave with Oliver after he destroys everything that matters? I also thought it was a little hint to Oliver of where his loved ones were. Things that make you go hmmmm. “I’ll cover you. Really.” CLASSIC I feel like Curtis should never go anywhere without backup. That should be a team rule. “I thought you would have tagged your pets by now.” Malcolm never stops being a supreme dick. It’s one of the few things I enjoy about him.Didn’t you love all the preview clips promoting Bl*ck Si*n’s return?Maybe because there were only two scenes they couldn’t release any clips. Hehehe.

So, that’s the policy I’ve been operating on when I use gifs on the blog. It’s been brought to my attention that other gif makers would prefer source credit if you use your gifs. This is the first time in three years I’ve heard differently. I absolutely understand the thinking and am more than happy to oblige. The problem is keeping track of all of this. As the season progresses, more and more episodes combine and I end up using gifs from previous eps. Not gonna lie, it’s gonna be difficult to keep track of where each gif came from every time I use it.  So, I am attempting to balance the two different ways of thinking when it comes to using gifs specifically in my reviews. I’ve hammered out a gif usage policy that represents both view points. Hopefully it solves any issues anyone may have. We’re going to give this a try and see how it goes. Going forward, this is how I’ll address gif usage: 1. I will continue to like or reblog any gifs I use in the reviews or elsewhere on the blog. 2. If I am using a gif specific to an Arrow episode, I will give credit to the creator at the end of the review.  For example: Arrow 5x22 gif creators: (insert tagged blog names) 3. If you don’t want me to use your gif in the review, please message me and I will remove it. 4. I’ll add a disclaimer to the end of the reviews too. I have a disclaimer on the blog, but I will be moving it to the main page under copyright. " True text

My life interferes with my ability to write insanely long reviews. Sorry for the wait my friends. Your patience is appreciated.There comes a moment in every person’s life when you realize your life is your own, a separate entity beyond your parent’s expectations and dreams for you. You also see your parents for what they are… imperfect people just like you. There is freedom in these realizations and it is a crucial part of adulthood.  As you grow older, your life is less and less defined by being what your parents leave behind. You begin to wonder what you will leave behind. You define a legacy for yourself. You learn how to live for yourself.That is essentially the process both Oliver and Thea are going through in “Honor Thy Fathers” but because they are superheroes everything is on a super scale. Both Oliver and Thea faced their past tonight. They saw Robert Queen for who he really was and with those lessons came a certain peace. The past is no longer weighing them down. Both Thea and Oliver are free to look to the future.Not quite sure what to do with a television show that gives me everything I’ve been waiting for on a narrative level. So… Imma gonna drink wine and throw confetti.Let’s dig in…OlicityI am very specifically incorporating Oliver’s section of the review with Felicity because he could not have gotten here without her. That’s true for both this episode and this five year journey.  This is sort of my Arrow mantra, but let’s do this again for old times sake shall we? In every hero’s story, there is a great love. This love is what the hero fights for, sacrifices for and lives for. This love is what makes the hero a hero. The wonderful thing about Oliver and Felicity’s love story is they are each heroes in their own right. The love Oliver has for Felicity has helped her evolve into the hero she is and the love Felicity has for Oliver has helped him evolve into the hero he is.However,  ""Honor Thy Fathers"" was specifically about Oliver. The road to the Green Arrow was long and difficult.  I’ve always said when Oliver becomes the Green Arrow he will ready for Felicity. She is the last piece to this puzzle. However, he cannot become the Green Arrow without her.  Oliver must walk this road alone sometimes, but he also must walk it with Felicity. What’s so beautiful about “Honor Thy Fathers” is not only did Felicity walk those final steps with Oliver… she held his hand. Chase sent Oliver a corpse encased in concrete because… the fun? Honestly, Prometheus does the most fucked up things and I love him for it. Arrow has found its off the wall, loony tunes Joker and please oh please can we keep him?It’s a fifteen year old corpse, so it’s not Robert Queen like we presumed. It’s actually much worse. It’s the body of the man Robert Queen killed. Now, way back in Season 1 the audience was told this little nugget of information in the flashbacks of 1x21 “The Undertaking.” Oliver, however, was not.  For those of you who are like me and have absolutely no recollection of this information, allow me to fill you in:Robert Queen: Because I’m not the man you think I am. About a month before the opening of the steel factory, the one in The Glades,  I was approached by a local councilman. He wanted money. Told me that’s the way everything was done in The Glades. I told him I never paid a bribe in my life.  We got into an argument. I didn’t want to hurt him,  I swear Moira, but he fell. Moira: Oh dear God.Robert: The work I’m doing with Malcolm, with the list, it’s my penance Moira.Moira: So you’ll atone for one murder by committing hundreds? Thousands? Robert, you listen to me, whatever wrongs you’ve committed, whatever mistakes you’ve made, preventing this horror is your chance to make it right. Please Robert, promise me you won’t let this happen.Robert tried to make it right. He plans in motion to stop Malcolm. He told Moira everything was going to be alright… and he got on the boat.Note the episode number. We found out the truth about Robert Queen in the flashbacks of 1x21. It is no accident that, four years later, Oliver is finally coming to grips with that truth in 5x21. Robert Queen’s death is the catalyst for Oliver’s hero’s journey and the beginning of his pain. This road for Oliver began with father, which is why it has to end with him. Our lives can change in a breath. One decision, one moment, can change your life, change you, forever.  As Robert Queen held his son on that boat he was given a gift. A moment of clarity.  Robert saw his son for who he was and everything he could be. When Robert looked into Oliver’s eyes, he saw the legacy he wanted to build, but death would not allow. Robert didn’t know how, but somehow he knew Oliver would survive. Oliver would make it home. He would make it better. Oliver would right his wrongs. Anatoly: That video. He wants you to save your home. I do not think   Kapiushon is what he had in mind.The thrill of the characters voicing my thoughts never gets old. Anatoly is right. Robert Queen never imagined the Green Arrow. He saw something different I think and it gave Robert the courage, and the peace, to pull the trigger.However, Robert’s death has weighed Oliver down for ten years.  Oliver has never been the same since then. He blamed himself for Robert’s death. It’s the reason why Oliver believed he enjoyed killing. He believed he was a monster long before Prometheus came into the picture. He just was too scared to admit it.Arrow is pushing Oliver to face the truth on multiple levels. Last week, he confessed his deepest shame to Felicity and discovered that his deepest fear, Felicity leaving, was for naught. Instead, truth is what brought her home. Truth is what made Felicity stay. Truth led Oliver to forgiveness and opened the door to the love that’s been waiting for him all along.But Felicity isn’t the whole story. There’s more truth Oliver has to discover, both on his own and with Felicity by his side. Primary among that is the truth about Robert Queen. Oliver has to understand who his father really was and what that means for him. Naming the darkness was the first step.Confessing to Diggle, so Oliver’s mind could understand the truth, was the second step.Confessing to Felicity, to love, so his heart could believe the truth, was the third step.And understanding his father, in a way Oliver never has before, is the final step.Step to what you ask? To letting the pain go.Oliver is convinced Chase is framing Robert. There is no way Robert killed this councilman, even though Dinah and Lance bring some hard-to-defy evidence like Robert’s DNA under the councilman’s skin. Damn that pesky concrete. Conservation is a motherfucker.Oh Oliver… my sweet summer child. You poor bastard. It’s no secret that Oliver views his family with rose colored glasses, but there’s something eternally innocent about the way Oliver loves his family. It’s like he’s trying to hold on to the way he remembered them before the Island. Except, every new secret unearthed makes that memory seem further and further away.What Oliver doesn’t understand, and what he will come to realize, is seeing someone for who they truly are is still love. Unconditional love doesn’t mean we are ignorant to the flaws of those we love. It doesn’t mean we cannot demand better. It simply means we continue to love that person while acknowledging the truth of who they are. It’s a more complete way of loving. A more honest love. Of course, Chase has thought of everything, which includes irrefutable proof that he leaves with his father’s attorney - the last man to see the councilman alive. The proof is security footage of Robert Queen killing the councilman.Now, generally speaking, this is the least murdery murder video I’ve ever seen.It’s CLEARLY an accident, but that makes it all the more tragic. Instead of telling the truth, Robert Queen runs away. He covers it up. If Robert had confessed and shown the video to the police, yes there probably would have been consequences (Murder 2 is a thing), but nowhere near as severe as the punishment for covering it up.This mistake is what led Robert Queen to Malcolm Merlyn. It why Robert believed in the list. It was his penance. It’s also what put him deep inside The Undertaking and squarely in Merlyn’s crosshairs.Shame runs deep into our marrow, until it becomes part of who you are. Robert’s shame led him down a dark path, just like Oliver’s did. Say what you will about Robert and Moira’s marriage, but it was confessing to his wife that made Robert see the truth. Just like Oliver confessing to Felicity made him see the truth.Oliver is horrified after watching the video. So… let’s talk about this because Oliver’s reaction is slightly confusing. First, he knew Robert was a murderer. Robert shot the other man on the raft  before he shot himself. THAT COUNTS OLIVER.  Also, his involvement with the Undertaking was pretty shady. So, why is Oliver freaking about little Mr. Accidental Death?Well… I think we need to keep a couple things in mind. First, this is five years later. Initially when Oliver came home he had a lot of difficulty with the knowledge that Robert failed the city, the list and the Undertaking. By the time Oliver arrives to the end of 1x23, and his battle with Merlyn, he believes his father was trying to stop The Undertaking and that’s why Merlyn killed Robert. All factual. So, after the events of Season 1, Oliver is able to view his father in an honorable light despite his past mistakes.As for the man on the raft, Oliver views that murder as his father doing what he had to for Oliver to survive. The key is, Oliver is able explain his father’s actions to himself. He is not able to do the same with the councilman.I don’t think Oliver has as much of a problem with the killing as he does the lying, which is extremely interesting given what he’s just gone through with Felicity. Oliver can tell the difference between accidentally knocking someone into a pit of cement versus breaking someone’s neck. Intent matters. So, Oliver is willing to give his father a pass on the actual killing because it was an accident. It’s why Oliver defends Robert to Thea. Oliver: That was an accident.Thea: Yeah, an accident he tried to cover up.Yuuup. That about sums it up kiddos. A+ work Queen sibilings. Both are right. It was an accident, but Robert did nothing to try and save the man. Concrete actually takes some time to harden there Bobby. You could have taken a minute to investigate or call the police. There was time.Instead, Robert leaves and covers it up.Oliver is having a very Felicity Smoak like reaction to all of this. Oliver thought he knew everything about his father. He thought he knew all of Robert’s secrets. Oliver had dealt with and processed all of those secrets. Then, he comes to find there’s another one lurking around the corner. Is it the worst thing Robert ever did? Well… it’s not good! That’s for sure. Whether or not it’s the worst is debatable, but the excuses and reasoning Oliver used to justify his father’s actions on the raft and with the Undertaking don’t quite fit with the councilman. Oliver has the rug pulled out from under him with this revelation. It makes him question everything about Robert Queen.This is precisely what happened to Felicity when she discovered Oliver’s lie about William. Felicity thought she knew Oliver’s secrets and processed all of them. Felicity thought they were past this and then she comes to find out that there’s another lurking around the corner. She had the rug pulled out from under her.The effect is jarring and takes some time for Oliver to process - just like it did for Felicity. Luckily for Oliver, he has Felicity to help guide him through it precisely because they’ve found a way to weather the William lie.I love Felicity’s reaction to Oliver watching Robert’s video again. “No pressure.” I mean… seriously. The enormity of what Robert was putting on Oliver’s shoulders is not often discussed, but this was one hefty load to bear.  The fact that Oliver rose to the occasion is just more proof Robert Queen saw the hero Oliver truly could be in those final moments. Oliver: Chase wants to destroy the basis for everything that we’re doing here and that crusade began with my father. Everything that I’ve done, everything, has been in some way about honoring him.Once again, Oliver tells Felicity what he’s afraid of. He’s getting pretty good at this isn’t he? He tells Felicity that he missed the truth - Robert Queen is a murderer. Oliver puts killing the councilman and covering it up in a different bracket than helping Merlyn with the Undertaking (but ultimately trying to stop it) or murdering the man on the raft. For Oliver, this is the worst thing Robert has ever done. Robert Queen would agree. Chase’s mission is to get Oliver to believe he’s a hypocrite and a killer. The subsequent confession that resulted from the torture made Oliver believe those things were true. Thanks to Diggle and Felicity’s love, Oliver understands the truth now. There’s a difference between enjoying killing and believing he enjoys it. Oliver’s deepest fear was that, deep down, he was a monster. The killing was a manifestation of who he truly is. As I explained in my 5x20 review, the reason Oliver so readily believed the lie is because he believes he killed his father. Oliver believed he was a monster before he stepped foot on Lian Yu.Except, Oliver isn’t a monster who enjoys killing nor is he to blame for Robert Queen’s death. Oliver Queen is an imperfect man, as we all are. Oliver is realizing on a deeper level that his father was just as imperfect. This is ultimately a gift. It’s pushing Oliver to see what Robert truly meant by, “Right my wrongs.” Oliver likes to put people in boxes - including himself. You are either one thing or the other. People are far more complicated than that. Oliver is not a sociopath who enjoys killing. However, he has killed. Those two things are not the same though and there is a wide berth in the distinction between the two. It’s the same with Robert Queen. Oliver’s father may not be as honorable as he thought. However, he’s not the monster Adrian Chase claims him to be.At first, Oliver feared his mission was a lie because of who he is. Now, he fears it’s a lie because of who Robert Queen was. Everything he’s done was to honor a man who wasn’t very honorable. In fact, Oliver has killed in his father’s name. Is it any different than what Chase is doing for his father? Maybe Chase is right. Maybe Oliver is a hypocrite.To which, Felicity responds…The conversation Oliver and Felicity have about his father is nearly identical to the one she and Oliver had about him, which is exactly the point. Like father like son. The only way to stop the cycle is to change it.No matter who Robert Queen was, he was a man who inspired Oliver to be a better man and save the city. All of which Oliver accomplished. Felicity argues perhaps the reasons for beginning the journey are not as important as the journey itself. PREACH MY SISTA!As Oliver struggles with the truth of his father, Felicity tells him once again what she knows to be true. Oliver Queen, the Green Arrow, makes lives better, including hers. Felicity sees what Robert Queen saw in that boat. She’s always seen it and that belief has helped Oliver see it too. Oliver did it. He became everything Robert asked him to be. Rather than question his motives for becoming the Green Arrow, Oliver simply needs to embrace it. In other words… Oliver needs to let the past go.  As Oliver laments his inability to really move forward, because the past always pulls him back, Felicity rightly points out it’s because Oliver lets it. LORD IS THAT THE TRUTH.  Listen, it’s not like Oliver’s pain isn’t understandble. Homeboy has lived through THE SUCK. But… he doesn’t have to keep living there.We cannot change the past. We can, however, change how we deal with it. None of us belong to our past. None of us are defined by it. The past is a piece of who we are, but it is not the sum total of who we are. The difference between Oliver being hostage to his past and moving forward to the future is a matter of choice. It’s been one Felicity has been asking him for a long time to make. Oliver simply hasn’t been ready until now.It’s the same as confessing his secret. Say it out loud Oliver. Say it out loud so you can let it go. It’s the reason it was so vitally important for Oliver to confess his shame to Felicity. Love reflected the truth to Oliver. Once he understood it, Oliver was able to let the shame go. Not only does Oliver tell Felicity he knows she’s right…he believes she’s right. This is why Oliver needs Felicity. It why he will always need her. Knowledge speaks to the mind, but belief comes from the heart. It’s why Oliver is able to process Robert’s lie for what it is… and let it go.Equally important is Oliver reaching out to Felicity. There is an ease between them. No more walls, but rather the intimacy that comes from the love and truth between them. William was once a taboo topic, but now they talk easily about his whereabouts. Oliver asks Felicity for help with William and is reassured by it. THY NAME IS CHARACTER GROWTH!And then… WE HAVE SHOULDER TOUCHING!!! My actual reaction:This is the Olicity equivalent to foreplay. Do not ask me where the rebuild is. SHOULDER TOUCH = REUNION. These are Olicity maths that don’t lie.More importantly, when Oliver discovers what Robert did he doesn’t make the same mistake and push Felicity away. He doesn’t isolate in his pain. Nor does Oliver allow his worst fears to dictate his reaction to her love. Instead, Oliver opens up to Felicity. He’s already told her the one thing he never wanted to. Facing that fear and shame makes facing all the rest easier. Lian Yu will always beckon to Oliver every time his past rears its head, but 5x20 taught Oliver how to leave the Island behind in a way he’s never known before. He makes the same choice in “Honor Thy Fathers.” He didn’t know it then, but there was a piece of himself Oliver was holding back in Season 4. Oliver understands that now and faced it. This time, he doesn’t hide from Felicity. Oliver chooses to leave the island behind and walk through the door Felicity opened in “Underneath."" Oliver shows Felicity the video. He listens. Oliver lets Felicity in. Her words land because Oliver allows them to.  In this moment, Oliver chose home instead of the island because now he understands how to. Now he understands there’s nothing to fear in that choice. This is the change Felicity asked for.Oliver is ready.  He’s ready for Felicity, which means he’s ready to be the Green Arrow - in the way he’s meant to be.Oliver puts on the suit, but it’s Felicity’s speech that galvanizes the choice. Oliver must become the Green Arrow to be worthy of the kind of relationship she deserves, but he cannot become the Green Arrow without her. Putting on the suit as a direct reaction to Felicity’s words is the perfect way to encapsulate this symbiotic balance. It reinforces absolutely everything I’ve believed about Arrow and have spent the last three years writing about. I have to be honest, it’s an extremely satisfying moment and worth waiting five years for.Felicity harnesses his light once again. Felicity’s belief makes Oliver believe like it has so many times before. Only this time Oliver knows he is worthy of the responsibility in a way he hasn’t before. The darkness no longer has power over Oliver because he faced it. It means Oliver is able to see himself as more than just one thing - killer or hero/sinner or saint. He understands he’s a complicated man, an imperfect man, but a man who is determined to always be better.This belief also leads Oliver to some truth about who Robert Queen really is. Oliver is able to see his father the same way - a complicated man, an imperfect man, but a man who was determined to be better. This clarity leads to a gift. Oliver tells Chase mid battle Justin Claybourne was going to disown him because…The truth bomb is a bit jarring to be honest because the revelation to Oliver was off screen. I think I would have preferred to see Oliver obtain this little golden nugget and know the ace up his sleeve going into the fight with Chase. It felt less like a bomb and more likeI’m being a little nitpicky. I know, which is why I’m letting it go.Chase wants to a side by side comparison of their fathers, Robert and Justin. Fine, let’s play Crazy Pants. Let’s just say accidentally killing a man and covering it up is on the same level as trying to gas the population with a terminal disease in order to make millions off the antibiotic. Or let’s say being complicit in a plan to kill hundreds or thousands with an earthquake machine is the same as the terminal disease plan. Perhaps that’s a more equal side by side comparisons.First, Justin Claybourne expressed no remorse. In fact, most of those people landed on the list because they rejected the concept of remorse. It doesn’t make it okay that Oliver killed him, but it certainly doesn’t equate to the remorse Robert Queen felt for all his wrongs.If this is really about honoring their fathers, then Chase missed a very key element. Justin Claybourne never wanted Sam to honor him. His father didn’t want anything to do with him.It’s a moment of clarity for Oliver. Robert Queen was never asking Oliver to honor him. Robert was asking his son be more honorable than him. Robert believed in Oliver’s goodness, in his heart, and had absolute faith his son would be a better man because… he already was one to Robert.  Robert never stopped believing in Oliver and he gave up his life for this belief.I don’t think Oliver ever looked at it that way before. He understood his father made a courageous sacrifice for his survival, but Oliver has been so consumed with the guilt and shame over his father’s death that he was never able to see himself through Robert’s eyes. I don’t think Robert was viewing Oliver with rose colored glasses. He knew the good, the bad and the ugly about his son and still… he believed. Robert saw Oliver the way Diggle sees him. The way Felicity sees him. Oliver Queen is imperfect, but he is worthy. Unconditional love is not an ignorance to flaws. It is belief in spite of them. It’s important not to discount William’s role in Oliver’s realizations and evolution. You understand how much your parents love you when you have a child of your own. I didn’t know I had the capacity to love that much until my daughter. How does one put the infinite into words? It’s a love absolutely worth dying for, but more importantly, it’s one worth living for. The councilman’s murder revealed Robert’s deepest shame. Oliver understands the full meaning of, ""I’m not the man you thought I was” because he knows the truth. And because of everything he’s gone through this season.Robert Queen is where the shame began. Robert Queen is where the shame must end. Oliver sees his father clearly now and he understands that Robert’s sins are not his own. We are not condemned to live our parents lives, to make their mistakes or become who they were. There exists a choice. Make no mistake - it is very easy to fall into the same patterns as our parents. That’s why we must be willing to see them for who they are - imperfect people. Just like us.For so long, Oliver Queen has lived in the past. He allowed the past to dictate and control who he was. Felicity’s request to stop living in the past finally lands with Oliver because… he’s ready for it to. The darkness has lost its power over him. The light has taken the stronger hold. Oliver is just… done. He’s tired of being pulled back. It’s time to move forward.Sometimes it’s easier to see who we are when we see ourselves reflected in someone we love. Thea immediately assumes because of who her parents were that’s the reason she’s grown up to be a monster.  For Oliver, the last thing Thea is or could ever be is a monster.  If Thea’s fate isn’t predetermined in Oliver’s eyes… then wouldn’t that be true for him as well? Of course it is. We are not carbon copies of our parents. Oliver is not fated to be like Moira and Robert anymore than Thea is fated to be like Moira and Malcolm (and Robert). Their parents are part of Oliver and Thea, of course, and that includes their mistakes. However, they are not beholden to them. Our parents lives can be a great gift to us. We can see the twists and turns of their lives - the places where they made mistakes and where they triumphed. We are not meant to become our parents, but rather to learn from them - the good, the bad and the ugly. Not unlike the past. Oliver gives Thea the video Robert left of her. He knows it was wrong to keep it from her. Oliver thought the video would be a burden, but he understands now it can be freeing for Thea. She needs to see herself through Robert’s eyes, just like Oliver did.There’s another moment of significant change in Oliver. He doesn’t kill Chase. The councilman’s murder makes something crystal clear to Oliver - Robert’s wrongs started with killing. Therefore, they cannot be fixed with killing. “What good is a family without a soul?”Anatoly you speak my truth! This is the question Robert asked himself in the video and it’s the question Oliver needs to start asking himself this. What good is Oliver really doing if he loses his soul in the process? This has never been about the people Oliver has killed. Most, if not all, were very bad people and the world is better off without them. Oliver was justified in killing them, but that’s really not the point. The point is the cost to Oliver’s soul. All of this death takes a toll on him and it strips little pieces of it away. Oliver has to stop giving those pieces away, so he has to stop killing. Arrow is pushing Oliver to a stronger moral code. Something to hold to beyond rationalizations and justifications, because those can ebb and flow. That’s not real morality. We can justify pretty much anything if we need to.It’s why Arrow incorporated killing with lying. It’s not just about killing, but a broader morality. A more honorable one. Robert killed and he lied. Oliver killed and lied. We’ve seen the ramifications of both those choices and the roads they lead down. Anatoly: The people closest to you always pay for your sins. You are paying for your father’s. Who will pay for yours?Death begets death. There’s been a cost for Oliver and sometimes it was more than he can bear.This is generational. Oliver is no longer the son. He’s the father now. If he doesn’t want to repeat Robert’s mistakes, if this is really about being a better man, then Oliver has to learn from his father. So, William isn’t pulled into the same generational cycle. It gives his mission, his morality, a new focus. Oliver has to look to the future, and not the past, to define it.But first… there’s one last thing Oliver needs to do for his father before he can really let it go. Sometimes, if we’re lucky, we are given a glimpse. It comes to us like… truth. I’ve experienced this in my own life. Once as a small child and then again, years later, when I was pregnant with my daughter. The first time it happened I was only 11. It was the night before a big and risky surgery and I was scared. I didn’t want to fall asleep, primarily because I was afraid I wouldn’t wake up after the operation. So, I was trying to stay awake as long as possible. I decided to say a prayer. I don’t particularly remember what I prayed, but I do remember a voice. Loud and firm, but very gentle. It said, “You are going to be fine. Go to sleep.” In that moment I was absolutely overwhelmed with a sense of peace. I never felt calm like that and I instantly fell asleep.You can call me nuts. It’s okay. Sometimes I wondered if I dreamed it, but then it happened again. When I was facing a life threatening pregnancy with my daughter.  The voice was just as firm and loud. It kept saying, “28 weeks.” And I knew, I KNEW, that’s how long I had to hold on for my child to be okay. Eventually, my body just gave out and the doctors had to deliver her. My daughter’s birthday was exactly 28 weeks to the day. As they wheeled me into surgery, I knew it was possible I might not wake up. The same peace overwhelmed me and I also knew, no matter if I survived or not, everything was going to be okay.Y'all know by now I’m Catholic, so you can figure out who I attribute the voice to. I tell these stories because I think sometimes in moments of life and death, we’re given these glimpses for a reason. These glimpses give us the strength to face what’s coming, even if what’s coming is death. Those moments weren’t lonely for me and it gives me hope, that when it is my time, I’ll be able to face it without fear.We enjoy stories because they entertain, but also because they remind us of our own lives or we are able to glean some truth from them. I was hooked on Arrow before Felicity Smoak showed up. Robert Queen’s death is what hooked me. It was shocking and jarring. I immediately understood the horrors Oliver had survived and that it was just beginning. I needed to see where his story went. So, that’s what Robert’s words to Oliver mean to me. He was a given a glimpse and that is what gave him the strength to pull the trigger. I’ve often wondered what the glimpse looked like, whether it was a voice or an image or maybe both. Arrow answered a lot of questions in “Honor Thy Fathers” (like how Oliver learned to fly),  but this was the question I wanted answer - What was Robert’s glimpse? It was this…Robert Queen never imagined the Green Arrow. He only saw his son, dressed in a fine suit, taking responsibility for what he did. Oliver admitted Robert killed the councilman. He stood up and told the truth. By doing so, Oliver freed Robert of his shame. Oliver freed himself too. More than saving the city, this is what Robert meant by “right my wrongs.”Oliver isn’t able to offer any defense for his father’s crime because… there isn’t one. Except perhaps fear, but that doesn’t justify his actions. Oliver does, however, tell Star City about the man that he knew. He tells them that Robert, in a moment of courageousness, sacrificed his life for his son. It doesn’t erase his sins, but penance isn’t about that. It’s about atonement.A Face Like Mine by Peter Bradley AdamsI know he had a reasonI know a man can get lostWhatever he believed inI know he suffered the cost His picture’s almost fadedBut I filled in the linesAnd nothing’s unforgivenSo father don’t you cry Now the years have found meWith a child of my ownAnother generationThat must carry the load But somewhere there’s a memoryIn the back of my mindI see my father smilingWith a face like mineThis is a monumentally huge moment emotionally for Oliver. This is what letting go of the past looks like. Had Oliver found out about the councilman’s murder four years ago, he would not have done this. He would have not told the truth. Oliver would have covered it up in the name of protecting his father. Oliver has a deeper understanding now of the truth honor really requires. He also understands what his father really needed in terms of “righting his wrongs.”Oliver also tells the truth about how Robert Queen died. “Honor Thy Fathers” is not the first time Arrow has used this title. 1x02 was entitled similarly, “Honor Thy Father.” Oliver is very vague about Robert Queen’s death.Oliver implies, if not flat out lies, that Robert went down with the boat. That’s the public story. It’s the story Diggle knew before Oliver told him the truth. It’s what Thea believed before Oliver told her the truth.Now, Oliver tells Star City the truth.  He tells everyone how Robert Queen really died. Oliver admitting this publically is such a profound statement on his healing.  He  isn’t carrying the guilt or shame for Robert’s death anymore. Whatever wrongs his father committed, Oliver can look back and see that moment, the moment where everything changed, as one of profound courage and unconditional love. “I didn’t know how painful it would be to keep my secrets. You asked me to save this city. To right your wrongs. I will. I swear. But to do that, I can’t be the Oliver that everyone wants me to be. Which means that sometimes to honor your wishes I need to dishonor your memory.”Oliver made this speech to his father, kneeling in front of his grave. He had such a different perspective back then on what honoring Robert meant, the necessity of lies and the danger of truth.  The weight of the past, of what Robert had asked of him, is weighing so heavily on Oliver in this moment it’s almost crushing him. This confession, admitting Robert’s guilt and how he died, is the last weight of the past that Oliver finally puts down. By doing so, Oliver truly honors his father. He breaks the cycle of lies with truth. Oliver breaks the cycle of killing by seeking a different kind of justice. He’s allowed family, friendship and love back into his heart. He’s made lives better as the Green Arrow. And as Oliver Queen.He’s saved the city. Oliver has been forgiven  and has learned to forgive himself. He’s the Oliver he never thought he could be.This is all Robert Queen has ever wanted for his son. He never wanted Oliver to be like him or live in the past. All Robert wanted was for Oliver to live his life to fullest for himself and for the people and city he loves. That’s the life Robert died for. So… live it Oliver.Thea QueenOf all the characters on Arrow, I think Thea’s arc has been the most complex and interesting. Truthfully, I didn’t like Thea very much in Season 1 and watching her evolution has been one of the great joys of this show.  Yeah, she was benched in Season 5, which sucks, but it happens to every character eventually. My concern any time a character leaves the Arrow cave is they will be immediately regulated to Laurel Lance land of S1 & S2, where it feels like they are on a different show. That’s sort of what happened with Thea this season. My preference, of course, is to utilize Thea the best way possible (and in every episode) like they did Season 1- Season 4. However, this is television and it is an imperfect medium. So, my next preference is to use the character in targeted episodes that produce maximum narrative punch. Arrow achieved maximum punch with Thea in “Honor Thy Fathers.”Oliver and Thea are on very similar trajectories this year, which I wasn’t expecting at the beginning of the season. I sort of thought Oliver would have his crap together a little sooner. HA! I know. Foolish child. Truthfully, I just didn’t see Prometheus coming nor was I expecting the darkness bomb that was 5x17. Oliver’s 2B journey is very similar to the journey Thea has been grappling with since, really Season 3. Is she a monster? Listen, being Malcolm Merlyn’s daughter isn’t easy and if I had that psychopath’s genes in my DNA, I’d be giving the mirror a serious and hard look.  Of course, Thea only need to look at Tommy for hope that maybe she’s nothing like her father and DNA doesn’t determine our souls.Ugh. Still so painful.I actually think Thea is more like Moira than she is Merlyn.BABY MOIRA LIVES!!! Moira pulled some seriously shady stuff, which includes being complicity in the murder of hundreds. Moira was always willing to do whatever was necessary to protect her children and reconciled that her love for them balanced her sins in the cosmic equations. Moira was willing to go to the depths of hell itself if it meant keeping her children safe. This love gave Moira the strength to give up her life for Oliver and Thea.Thea operates in a similar way. She’s driven by love, like her mother, and not revenge and hate, like her father. But Thea understands something that even Moira did not. No matter how much their parents loved them, it doesn’t excuse everything they did. Since Thea is driven by love, she can apply this lesson to herself. Being willing to do whatever is necessary to protect those she loves isn’t an absolution. There’s still a price to be paid. What I love about Thea is her realism, especially when it comes to their family. She’s the complete opposite of Oliver. Thea hears Robert killed a councilman and thinks, “Yup. Makes sense,” while Oliver rails idealistic platitudes about their parents. It seems pretty clear there’s only one Queen sibling who actually watches Arrow. I suggest Seasons 1-5 on DVD for Oliver for Christmas Thea. It’ll make a nice stocking stuffer.Oliver faced his own internal monster these past few episodes, which has prepared him to help Thea. Maybe in a way he wasn’t capable of before. Now, he understands what Thea feels on a deeper level because instead of avoiding that pain like he has for the last five years, Oliver finally faced it. Well… after Chase tortured him, but Oliver still did all the work after, so I’m giving him points.Oliver harnesses Thea’s light by realizing that maybe he’s not the person she needs right now. Who Thea needs right now is her father - Robert Queen. Oliver was afraid that what Robert says in the video would be a burden to Thea. He didn’t want his sister to feel like she has to take care of him, which as Felicity accurately points out, is so Oliver Queen. Oliver sometimes fails to understand that this whole family thing is reciprocal.What Robert tells Thea isn’t a burden. It’s freedom. It’s such an exquisitely emotional moment, because we realize how well Robert knew both his children and how much Thea needs her father right now.Thea is stronger than Oliver. She always has been and Oliver knows that. As much as Oliver has survived, as much as he’s overcome, there is always a moment when pain shuts Oliver down. I don’t attribute this all to his PTSD. This happened to Oliver before the Island. Part of his journey to the Green Arrow is to learn how to process pain and adversity in a healthier way. “Fear doesn’t shut you down; it wakes you up.” - Four, Divergent Thea isn’t like that. Pain doesn’t shut Thea down. It wakes her up. She finds a way to absorb the pain and uses it to make her stronger.  “If there’s a crisis, you don’t freeze, you move forward. You get the rest of us to move forward. Because you’ve seen worse. You’ve survived worse, and you know we’ll survive too. You say you’re all dark and twisty. It’s not a flaw, it’s a strength. It makes you who you are.” Derek Shepherd, Grey’s AnatomyRobert speaks to the core of who Thea is. Souce: @oilversqueenHer strength is what makes her the rock Oliver Queen can crash against. There are two things Oliver cannot survive - losing Thea or Felicity. Oliver needs his sister to go on living. Losing her would be his breaking point. Oliver doesn’t come back from that.This love Thea feels for her brother, and everyone she loves for that matter, is often what causes her to cross lines. Robert gives Thea a gift because his words help her refocus that love. Oliver doesn’t come back from losing Thea and there’s more than one way to lose someone. If she wants to help her brother, then Thea has to hold the moral line as well.  Thea can love just as intensely as Moira and Robert (and maybe even Malcolm), but she can also love differently. That’s how she breaks the cycle.Oliver passes along the advice Felicity gave him to his sister because, after five years, he’s finally realized she’s always right and life would just be a lot simpler if he just listened to her the first time.I think the words land with Thea for the same reason they land with Oliver. The past is a heavy burden to carry and there just comes a point when you are tired. You want to let it go. Someone just needs to tell you that it’s okay. The Queen siblings are tired. They are ready to let this go. (So is the audience kids. Go with God.)So that’s what Oliver does for Thea. She’s not a monster. She’s not destined to become like Malcolm or even Moira and Robert. Thea is her own person and it’s okay to let the past go. It’s okay to start living for herself, because… Oliver is right. That’s what Moira would want. That’s what would Robert want. It’s what they died for.Lance and Wild DogSeriously, I ship it hard. The friendship between Lance and Wild Dog has been one of the surprises for me this year. It’s taken a little while to get there, but their scenes together are really starting to land with me.  Paul Blackthorne and Rick Gonzalez just play off each other so well. Their two characters just blend together, which is kind of shocking when you look at how different they are.Rene wants his daughter back. This makes me so damn happy. I enjoy hero stories that are moving somewhere. Rene’s intent and purpose for being Wild Dog took a little while to flesh out, but ultimately my take away is- this year with Team Arrow prepared Rene to be the father Zoë needs.  Like so many before him, the mask was an outlet for his grief and rage, but I am seeing a less wild version of Wild Dog these past few episodes. He is learning. He is growing. He is far less annoying. Damn it. I like him.His reticance about putting Zoë through a hearing I think actually shows how good a father Rene is. He doesn’t want to put Zoë through emotional trauma. Rene is harboring a lot of guilt for what happened to her mother, for the reason Zoë is in foster care to begin with. It would be very easy to believe she’s better off. (Does this sound like anyone we know?)Lance tells Rene he’s right. The hearing may bring up bad memories for Zoë, but that’s exactly why he needs to go. Rene needs to get his daughter back so he can give her new memories - happy ones - of them together. Otherwise, all she be left with is the bad. Rene has resigned himself to living in the past and by doing so he’s resigned his daughter to the same fate. He’s refusing to look to the future, to the possibility of happiness, because of what happened in the past.Lance became pretty emotional during his little chat with Rene and pretty much begs him to go to the hearing. Quentin Lance is a hard shell to crack, but once you do he’s just full of ooey gooey yumminess. He cares about Rene. He’s seen how much he’s grown and Lance firmly believes Zoë is better off with her father.I also think some of the emotion can be attributed to Laurel. She’s always there, just underneath the surface, for Lance. Lance has a hefty amount of guilt for how Laurel died and for the pain his alcoholism caused her. Quentin doesn’t have the same opportunity that Rene does. He can’t make new happy memories with his daughter. He will never have that chance again. So, some of this for Lance is trying to get Rene to see that he still has a future with Zoë. Lance does not.  All he has left is the past.It’s why Rene not showing up makes ABSOLUTELY no sense. So it’s one of two options: A) Rene still has a ways to go or B) my girl @callistawolf is right and Prometheus already took him.Stray ThoughtsThis really could have served as a season finale for me. I mean… obviously Chase is ten steps of Oliver, got captured intentionally and is going to fuck shit up crazy pants style. But from an Oliver Queen emotional evolution standpoint? I’m good. He’s everything I ever wanted him to be (which is how he’ll beat Prometheus).  Eh… well… alright, if I’m being honest I need him to kiss Felicity. Then we can trot off to Season 6. First up in the “Arrow Finally Answers Series Long Questions” Robert taught Oliver how to fly. It was some of his last happy memories of his dad. Awww. Also… Oliver had a skill before the island? I didn’t know that could happen!Deathstroke mask washed up on shore and Oliver used it as a grave marker for Slade because he was his friend. Oliver also felt it was some sort of sign BECAUSE IT WAS. DUN DUN DUNN!!!!!Oliver was only on Lian Yu for TWO DAYS before the boat rescued him. A boat Anatoly arranged. Oliver’s Tom Hanks Castaway hair do was a wig. Oh Arrow… that’s very meta of you.“It makes Isobel Rochev look like a bad practical joke.” Hmm…  did you sleep with Chase Oliver? Asking for a friend.  Me: Well… Oliver and Diggle haven’t done a concrete hole yet. Curtis, and not the T-Spheres, took someone down. PROGRESS!This might be the truest thing anyone has ever said about Oliver.Prometheus pulls out a sword. I start looking around for Oliver’s Ra’s Al Ghul Killin’ Sword. Would seem handy at the moment.  Source:sharingmyworldIs there anything cuter than Proud Felicity? The correct answer is no there is not.Mini rant: Dinah asking Curtis whether or not they should move in on Sampson was kind of ridiculous. DINAH IS A COP. She would know that the guns could be legal and they need to wait to have actual evidence of a crime for the case to hold up. We did not need Curtis to explain this to her. See… this is what bugs me about Curtis. More often than not, they are dumbing down characters (mostly FEMALE) to give him something to freaking do. I love the name Zoë. Always have.There’s always someone on this fucked up Island Oliver. How did you not check the whole island before Anatoly left? Have you not watched the damn show?***None of the gifs are mine.

With Adrian Chase (Josh Segarra) still on the loose, mysterious  hacker organization Helix offers Felicity (Emily Bett Rickards) a way to  track him down in exchange for her services involving something  illegal. Needless to say, Oliver (Stephen Amell) & Co. won’t be  happy. But Ollie and Felicity will be forced to face their divide head on  next week when the duo gets trapped in the bunker together. Will this  actually bring them closer together? EW turned to executive producer  Wendy Mericle to get the scoop: ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: What can you tease of what Felicity has gotten herself into? And will we get more info on Helix? WENDY MERICLE: We will definitely get more info on Helix. We’re super psyched about this episode because it is really Felicity’s Dark Night of the Soul.  We’re not going to wrap it up here, but we’re definitely going to take  her to one of the darkest places we’ve ever seen her character go.  Because she’s gone down this rabbit hole with Helix, she’s going to find  out that — as per usual when people get themselves involved with these  organizations — things aren’t always as they seem. Even though she has  been really blinded by her drive to get Adrian Chase, I think she’s  going to come out of this asking some pretty tough questions about  herself and her moral decisions, and there’s a pretty big fight with  Oliver, too. How might this actually bring Oliver and Felicity closer? We’re also very excited about next week’s episode. We haven’t done a lot  of bottle [episodes], and this is one of the few that we’ve done. I  think it turned out so well. [Director] Wendey Stanzler hit it out of  the park. They’re stuck in a bunker together, and they’re not in a good  place. They’ve taken their individual paths, which is was exactly what  they wanted at the top of the season. They’ve gone down these different  roads. Oliver’s tries to pull her back from this brink and has failed.  All that fallout is going to happen right there in the bunker where they  have nowhere to run and there’s no escaping that conflict. And yet the sizzle trailer seems to indicate they’re on the road to reconciliation. Is that true? They are definitely on the road toward — well, the interesting thing  about taking her down this road with Helix is she is going to come out  of it with this, the same way Diggle came out of it when he killed his  brother — new understanding and appreciation for where Oliver’s been and  what he’s been through. No matter whether they end up together or not  (sorry, all Olicity Twitter fans), this is going to absolutely deepen  the relationship. It has to. She’s now gone through her own island in a  way. Speaking of Diggle, an upcoming episode features Diggle and Lyla dealing with some marital issues. What’s going on there? We’ve always wondered, ever since Lyla stepped up and took over  A.R.G.U.S., the interesting thing about her character is she, in a lot  of ways, is very similar to Oliver in that she’s now in the position of  making some really hard decisions and having to constantly justify the  means by the end. Dig’s going to find out about some of these things  that she’s been doing, and he’s going to really wonder where did his  wife go? It’s rich territory because they’ve always been such a solid  couple. They’ve had their ups and downs, but I think this is the first  time where Dig has looked at her and wondered that this person that he  sees in front of him doesn’t really resemble the person that he fell in  love with. That’s an interesting question for anyone in a marriage  situation to be asking themselves. It’s interesting because there was an episode where Diggle  and Dinah were working really closely together, and fans noticed  some chemistry between them. Does that play into this at all, or was  that just two good actors working off each other? It’s two great actors working off each other. [Laughs.] That  said, I think that part of the fun of having the team there is it’s  going to create theses different dynamics. If, down the road, there’s a  little misunderstanding here or there, I’m not saying that might not  happen. But right now, that’s not the case. With Chase still on the loose, how much danger is the team in? It’s safe to say, without teasing too much, they’re in the most danger they’ve ever been in. How will the team — most of whom are relatively new and have  not faced an ultimate showdown with a big bad before — deal with heading  into the final battle with Prometheus? Each character is going to have a different reaction to it. Dinah is  very much on the page of, “This guy just needs to be taken down.” Rene  is too, but he’s going to have other stakes; we’ve met his daughter  before in episode 513. The people who have potential for collateral  damage, if you will, the people with families who have more at stake are  going to have different attitudes about that. Everyone is going to be  on the same page of wanting to take this guy down. Nobody has really  been left unscathed by Adrian Chase. They’re going to be all in, and all  in in a way that newbies would be. There’s no doubt that Oliver is  going to have a much more profound sense of the dangers ahead, but by  the same token, he’s come to rely on this team and he needs them. Malcolm Merlyn popped up in the sizzle reel. What role will he be playing in these last episodes? Malcolm is going to be doing exactly what he’s always done. Part of the  fun of him is that you never know exactly where he stands. One thing  that is absolutely clear is he’s always there for Thea. He and Thea are  going to have some pretty cool scenes together because she’s going to  come back and he’s going to be there. She’s not happy to see him. Oliver  is going to be pulling at any possible help, whether he can trust that  help or not; he’s going to be calling in every reinforcement he has to  take down Chase. I think Josh Segarra has done an amazing job at really  making Chase one of the scariest villains that we’ve seen on the show. Are Oliver and Slade actually aligning then? That’s a great question. With Deathstroke, you never really know who  you’re dealing with, in a similar way with Malcolm, but with a little  bit more of an edge, because the history between Slade and Oliver is as  deep and troubled as the one between him and Malcolm. Slade is  definitely coming back. We’re definitely going to be thinking he might  be on Oliver’s side. That’s all I’m going to say about that, to quote  Forrest Gump. [Laughs.] What’s next for Thea? Thea is going to be going through a very similar emotional journey —  Oliver’s going to maybe arrive at his conclusion emotionally a little  bit sooner than she does, but it’s the same idea of really grappling.  The last time we saw her, she was going away to try to figure herself  out, because she had gone down this very Moira-esque road and started to  pull these antics that were really morally questionable. She sees that,  so when she comes back, it’s not going to be because she’s ready, it’s  going to be because she has to. She’s going to be working that out.  Eventually, she’s going to get to a place where she can put the past  behind her, but it’s going to be a pretty hard road for her. Will Oliver ever be able to operate as Green Arrow again? And  if not, what does that mean for the future of the show? Are we going to  see a new legacy for him? He’s questioning his legacy; he’s been doing it all season. The fact  that we’ve put the Green Arrow under the microscope to such an extent,  we are definitely setting some stuff up for season 6. We will definitely  see the Green Arrow again, but in what capacity? That’s a really good  question. That’s a premiere question.  Not a ton of new information, but a great kick off interview for the final 5 episodes. I am extremely excited for 5x19 and the deep dive into Felicity’s dark arc. I’m ready for them to turn up the heat on this storyline and really examine Felicity’s motivations. Plus… OLIVER AND FELICITY FIGHT! I AM ALIVE!!!!! We’ve waited a long time for this my friends. I like that they’ve addressed the Diggle/Dinah thing. I’ve noticed the chemistry between these two characters too. David and Julianna work great together. However, I don’t think they’ll go there. Dyla is the anchor. They are rock solid, so I’m glad that they alleviated any concerns that the marital issues are Dinah related. The ARGUS storyline for Dyla sounds more interesting to me anyway, and again, is something we’ve waited a long time for. I’m just happy Audrey is back in any capacity. Her availability is so limited I’m just thanking my lucky stars they snagged her for a few eps.I like the clue they gave about Oliver in relation to Thea. Oliver arrives at his emotional conclusion sooner than Thea does, which says to me that he heads into 5x23 somewhat resolved on the man he is - which is why he’ll be able to beat Prometheus. That should tie into the Olicity reunion as well, which makes me think my hunch about 5x22 might be correct. But we shall see.I like that Thea is still grappling, but I’m a little wary of the Malcolm Merlyn factor. We’ve hit this Thea/Malcolm note so many times before. I hope they are driving at new ground with Thea. If she’s moving along the same trajectory that Oliver is, which Wendy says they are, then I’m less concerned because she will arrive at the same conclusion as Oliver. It’s the new ground we’ve been waiting for. Essentially the entire cast has been in a holding pattern since 4x23, especially Thea, Oliver and Felicity, so it’ll be nice for these storylines to come to fruition.As for what Wendy said about Olicity ending the season together or not - please don’t freak. Like I always say, the EPs are never going to tell us the status of Olicity’s relationship in an article teasing the rest of the season. Just sit back, relax, watch and enjoy. I think they are going to be great." False link

This is the first group that she’s allowed herself to be vulnerable with. Oliver was the one who sought her out and let her in, so her connection to him in particular is a special one. She has a particular fondness for Oliver — not in a romantic way, but as a partner. And with Diggle, he’s the second in command, and that appeals to Dinah. She likes to sort of team up and go on runs with him. He’s a competent fighter and so is she.  “Not in a romantic way”Say it for the people in the back!!!!This was a really good interview, but that was my favorite part.

It’s going to be really emotional. It’s going to be all about Oliver’s family, but not the family we’re thinking of right now. It’s going to end in a giant explosion, but not where we think it’s going to end, and the emotional punch is going to be bigger than the actual physical part of the bombs going off.  Oooh! Yeah season finale spoilers!! Alliances - I think it would be really cool for Oliver to team up with Malcolm Merlyn. All the Tommy references this year and Malcolm’s Legion of Doom arc on LOT, I’m thinking there could be a chance for emotional growth. Also, Malcolm is the reason Oliver ended up on that Island and he was the S1 Big Bad. So it would be very full circle if they teamed up.Family - “Not the family we’re thinking of right now.” This feels like a William reference. Maybe William is kidnapped? They must absolutely connect this finale to Robert Queen too. And I think Felicity could factor into that statement. I still think she could be kidnapped too. (Or maybe that’s wishful thinking, but I don’t care cause I love it *Jen hugs her spec*)Giant explosion - Blowing up the Island would be an AMAZING way to end the flashbacks and Oliver’s five year journey. (How does one blow up an island though?) Emotional punch bigger than the physical explosion? Yes, please. It’s a finale and it’s the end of the 5 year journey. It better pack one hell of a punch. @callistawolf speculated that Prometheus kills himself in the end, which I agree with. I think that’d be a great way to cap off the showdown - and really represents the darker road Oliver could have traveled. It’d also be pretty emotional if someone died in the explosion. As per usual, I nominate Malcolm Merlyn.

This isn’t like anything we have done before. It’s a great challenge but what we’ve learned in the past (2 times Ship of the Year award winners) is that Olicity fans go BIG!  The project:  - Celebrate Olicity’s legacy by dedicating a bench in their honor in a park of Vancouver (Where Arrow is filmed)  - The bench could now become a mini tourist attraction for fans all over the world who visit Vancouver.  Goal:  - The goal of the project is to raise 4,000$ CAD for a 10 years dedication which is approx. 3,050$ USD depending on the daily exchange rate.  How we will raise the money:  Follow this link to donate https://www.gofundme.com/olicityleavesitsmark What is included in the dedication? - All dedications include a single bronze plaque for inscription (maximum of 3 lines of text and 40 characters per line, including spaces and punctuation). Example of a bench at Stanley Park in Vancouver (Fern detail in the back).  Perks for this campaign - For every 500$ raised, there will be a special giveaway between those who donated 10$ and +. Example of giveaway (An Olicity shirt, Stephen Amell’s Autograph, Arts, Gift boxes etc.) More details coming….  - There will be a poll to determine which Olicity quote will be included on the plaque. & There will also be a poll to determine the exact location of the bench. We have been in contact with the City of Vancouver and they have specific maps for the benches available in parks.  Other Details:  - the money raised is reinvested in the parks for preservation aka the environment.  - If you would like to submit something for the giveaway, if you have any questions about the campaign or would like to submit art pieces to make this campaign beautiful, feel free to contact us @olicitybench on twitter.  Thank you very much!

This is no way means I’m going to get all of these done, but it’s good to have goals.Hiatus ProjectsArrow Season 5 Wrap Up: Yeah… so…. I’m really late on this. I have it written in my head. Doesn’t do y’all much good in there, but it’s thereQ&A: I’ll schedule one of these after I’ve posted the Season 5 Wrap Up. Wonder Woman Review: I saw it. It’s awesome. Review must be done.Arrow Season 1 Reviews: Remember when I actually had a schedule with these?   HA! Yeah me too. Didn’t last long did it? Oh life. You are a time cruncher. I do plan on revisiting these. Maybe knock off a few more before Arrow returns in October.Fanfiction: The past two summer hiatus projects were mostly devoted to big fanfictions (Once and Forever Queen and Broken Pieces). I’m not going big on fics this year, but I do have a couple of ficlet ideas.“Cake”: I owe @callistawolf a fic. This is the working title. She knows what it’s about. It’s gonna happen. I promise.Post 5x23 Reunion Ficlet: Yeah, I’m jumping on that bandgwagon. Too much fun not to.“Broken Pieces” Alternate Ending: Some were unhappy with my ending in Broken Pieces *cough*my beautiful beta Angela*cough* because some convinced me to change my original ending *cough* @callistawolf *cough* for the ending I actually ended up going with. So… because I love @hotcookinmama so much, and she’s such a fabulous & patient editor, I’m going to add the alternate ending I originally intended. It’ll be like “Choose Your Own Adventure” and who doesn’t love “Choose Your Own Adventure” books? NOBODY.Okay. That’s all I got for now.

I could use your help…  and it’s for a good cause too!  Many of you know that I’m an independent consultant with Pampered Chef, one of the top brands of kitchen tools in America. This has been my main source of income for 13 years. I usually go into people’s homes, do cooking classes and make commission from the sales of tools. Due to some health issues in the past 6 months, my business has been on the back burner. Unfortunately, that now means it’s crunch time for me. I have to reach certain sales goals this month or else I lose my leadership position in the sales force.  I did some brainstorming with @fiacresgirl and @scu11y22 . We came up with the idea of doing an Arrow Fandom VIRTUAL Pampered Chef Party to raise money for the American Cancer Society.  Up to 35% of the sales will be donated to the fight against breast cancer.  What’s a Pampered Chef Virtual Party? It’s a week-long group on Facebook. I post recipes, give cooking tips, host games and giveaway prizes! You participate at your pace when you have the time. It’s a lot of fun!  If you’re worried about losing your fandom anonymity by using your real-world Facebook page, keep in mind, you don’t have to share with anyone your Tumblr or Twitter name. All anyone knows is that we’re all fellow Arrow fans! So, want to learn to cook better than Felicity?  Don’t fail this omelette!  I’ll give a lesson on omelettes and I might even try a soufflé.

There’s really no medium like this. The experience is over in a couple hours with a movie.  We can control how quickly we read a book (even if we have to wait for additional sequels). But television? Television is a week to week story that spans years. Or at least it is if you watch live from start to finish. Television can be a long and arduous journey. Full of ups and downs. Great episodes and horribly bad ones.  We walk the road with the characters in real time. It’s a serious time investment and the hope is the story eventually connects. That the threads the writers weave come together in the end and we can see the full picture.  ""Lian Yu"" is one of those rare storytelling gifts that repays all the many years of patience.  We started this journey with Oliver Queen five years ago. We have walked each step with him. We’ve rejoiced with Oliver in his moments of triumph. We’ve grieved with him. We threw things at him with every maddening step backward. Step by step, we’ve watched Oliver come back to life. It hurt and he fought it for a long time, but slowly Oliver began to learn how to live again. Instead of shutting himself off, he chose to build a life filled with purposehonor teamworkfriendshipfamily and love. He’s clawed his way out of the dark and into the light that was always there, deep inside.  It was all leading somewhere. A destination, a choice, Oliver had to make. No matter how far Oliver has come there is always a piece of him that remains on the island… and on the boat.  Oliver had to return to Lian Yu, one last time, so he could finally let it go. So he could finally come home.A hero’s story is fraught with triumph and tragedy. There is both in “Lian Yu.” The great tragedy is once Oliver decides who he is, and is ready for all that entails, he’s faced with an impossible choice and loses what he’s spent years building.Or did he? Adrian Chase is the master chess player. He was always ten moves ahead, even in the final moments, but perhaps there was a move Chase couldn’t foresee. One Oliver set in motion years ago, in a moment where he clung to the light and held to Diggle and Felicity’s faith in him. A moment where Oliver kept a promise.Let’s dig in…Oliver QueenAs I often say, Arrow is about many things and we all have our favorite areas of focus. This story is about Olicity and Original Team Arrow for me, but it’s also about family. Family is core to what I love about Arrow. This story will always begin with Robert Queen for me. That tragedy on the boat is what drew me in and made me come back for Episode 2. This is the moment when everything changed for Oliver Queen. This is the moment the man he was died. Then, Oliver arrived on Purgatory and the island made him into something new. A Phoenix rising from the ashes.Oliver Queen carries many sins on his shoulders. He carries his father’s and he carries his own. There is intense guilt that comes from all those sins. They are like stones around Oliver’s neck. These stones weigh Oliver down, stop him from moving forward and, if they are heavy enough, roll him back. However, there is one sin that weighs more than all the others. It’s a shame and guilt that keeps Oliver trapped forever on Lian Yu. Robert Queen’s death.As I explained in my 5x20 review, Robert Queen is the reason Oliver believed he was a monster. Robert Queen is the reason Oliver believed he enjoyed killing. It is the one “What If” Oliver cannot escape from. If he never got on the boat, then his father would be alive. Robert could have made it to the island. He could have survived… if not for his son. In Oliver’s eyes, Robert Queen paid for his selfishness. Oliver believes, in his bones, that he killed his father.Arrow is a hero’s tale. In any hero’s tale there is a defining event. The catalyst that forever changes the hero from the person they were and turns them into the person they will become.  This event is almost always a tragedy.Why is it always tragedy? Because what these people experience would stop most humans in their tracks. Instead they rise.  This horrific moment propels them forward as they become more than a person. They become a symbol. A symbol for justice. A guardian for those who cannot defend themselves because once they were the defenseless. They have experienced the bitterness of injustice, the humiliation when someone breaks you down, and the unbearable pain of losing a loved one while being powerless to stop it. A hero rises and reclaims their power to ensure what happened to them never happens to anyone ever again. It is why we read their stories. It is why we admire them. It is why we love them. However, as much as this tragedy can propel the hero forward it can also be what holds them back. Eventually, the hero must make their peace with what happened. Otherwise their evolution remains trapped; forever locked in between the past and future. Eventually, a choice must be made.It’s important to know the genre of your story.  The will always be trials and tribulations in a hero’s journey. The hero will always fall, but the beauty in the tale is how he/she gets back up. That’s where a hero’s evolution lives. That’s how he/she becomes the very best parts of humanity. A hero finds a way to do what most of us couldn’t. Ultimately, the point of a hero’s tale is to challenge us to be better people. Adrian Chase is the embodiment of Oliver’s past, much like other villains before him. However, unlike the other villains, Chase is not motivated by revenge or power. Chase wants to reflect Oliver’s darkness back to him. So, that reflection becomes Oliver’s truth… because it is Adrian’s truth. Adrian believes Oliver Queen is death.Oliver began killing as a means of survival, but eventually it morphed into something else. A means to an end. A necessity. The cost of a nightly war. What I love about Arrow is that it doesn’t shy away from the examination of Oliver’s choices. “Lian Yu” takes that examination to another level. Yes, The Hood killed Justin Claybourne. That choice gave birth to Prometheus. Adrian Chase is created from Oliver’s killing, the darkest part of him.  Even though Oliver believed he made those choices out of necessity, and honorable reasons, he cannot escape the other haunting question - is there another choice? If there is, what does that choice look like? Where does it lead?Source: SMOAKS Oliver’s entire team is captured. He’s never beat the bad guy by himself. He’s always had Felicity and Diggle by his side and Oliver KNOWS this. He knows he cannot do it alone and that means asking for help anywhere he can find it. Source: captainheroism There’s a sense of trepidation as Oliver enters the ARGUS prison. Slade Wilson is the greatest villain in Arrow’s history (or at least he was until Prometheus). So what version of Slade are we going to get? Is it the Slade we fell in love with? The man who taught Oliver Queen how to survive and became a brother to him? Or is it the man we hate? The man who became consumed with revenge and killed Moira Queen.It would seem the Slade we’re going to get is the man of Season 1. The man we love, although he is forever changed by his actions of Season 2. The Mirakuru is out of his system and he’s regained his sanity. The rage over Shado’s death has settled into a quiet grief. Slade asks Oliver the question we’re all asking - why is Oliver asking for his help?Oliver explains Chase has everyone Oliver holds dear - including Thea and his son. Now, before we Olicity shippers get our panties in a twist I think those mentioned were calculated on Oliver’s part. He’s trying to get a read on Slade. Slade has expressed guilt over Moira’s death, an act Thea bore witness to. By mentioning Thea, Oliver is potentially twisting the guilt knife to illicit Slade’s help. As for William, Slade is a father and if there is humanity in him then I believe Oliver is trying to appeal to his fatherly compassion. Oliver offers Slade his freedom and the chance to find his son, Joe Wilson, to sweeten the pot.I love that Oliver has been searching for Joe Wilson. Slade was never gone from Oliver’s mind. The idea that the son could come back to avenge the father is something that occurred to Oliver I believe.  It’s not unlike Adrian Chase, except Oliver knows Joe exists. Oliver wanted to be prepared.  The one area that is the potential powder keg to this accord between Slade and Oliver is Shado. Shado’s death is what kicked off the war to begin with and I think Oliver’s omission of Felicity’s name, even though she’s included in “everyone,” is probably wise. Oliver still has the love of his life, whereas Slade does not. Felicity Smoak has always been the red zone between these two men. This is a delicate peace Oliver is brokering. Best not to poke the bear. Speaking from a psychological standpoint, I think it’s smart.The mere fact that Oliver is even considering working with the man who killed his mother shows how desperate he is and… how much he loves everyone Chase has taken. The past doesn’t matter when his future is at stake. Oliver sets it aside and asks the man who murdered his mother for help. That takes a strength and grace most people do not have. It would seem Slade Wilson agrees.Slade: I think I’m stating the obvious when I say I killed your mother. For that alone, you should have killed me.Oliver: Maybe what’s happening now is the reason I didn’t.This is a vitally important line, which is why it is in the first act. For all those worried about the cliffhanger, this is the line you pay attention to because it’s the ballgame. Source:  zorro-rita There’s an extreme amount of hilariousness with Oliver and his new band of Merry Men… err and woman. The sniping between Nyssa and Merlyn is funny enough to make a case for their own spin off. I don’t know what this show would be. All I know is I’d watch it. Oliver also frees Boomerang, Digger Harkness, which leads to a confrontation with Nyssa. Source:   queensarrow  ALL HAIL THE QUEEN. Although, I would have preferred she’d chosen a different piece of anatomy, but we’re still on at 8/7c. Next year kids. Source:  zorro-rita Chase blows up Oliver’s plane and Team Misfit Toys is completely unfazed. CLASSIC. It does, however, present a problem and makes this remark seem wildly more relevant.Nyssa & Merlyn split up from Oliver, Slade and Digger. They find the some of the team (Felicity, Thea, Curtis and Samantha) in cages. There’s a really fascinating shift as Slade and Oliver divide. Oliver goes to Samantha to inquire about William. Slade immediately moves to Felicity’s cage. Given their history, I should be uneasy, but it feels like Slade is working in tangent with Oliver. William is an innocent and Oliver has to find his son, but that doesn’t make Felicity any less important to him. So, Slade puts his body in front of the woman he once tried to kill - to protect her. Or maybe I just so desperately want to believe Slade Wilson is redeemable because, a long time ago, I loved him. It’s all too easy because it’s supposed to be. Talia shows up with Evelyn and aims an arrow on Samantha while Diggler Hartness pulls a gun on Slade. Chase already made a deal with him. Evenlyn makes an interesting comment to Slade. She says Chase told them it would be pointless to reach out to him. Chase has done his homework on everyone in Oliver’s life. If he thought he could use Slade he would have. Or this is all part of the ruse? Y'all… this is fun. I’m having a good time. Digger offers Slade the same deal and it seems like Slade takes him up on it. Now… I missed this watching the episode but that’s why we have fandom members with eagle eyes and wonderful gif makers. Slade tells Evelyn to put a gun on Oliver.This is a call back to 1x14 and @cogentranting does a wonderful job detailing the beauty of this scene. It’s a coded message to Oliver. While it may seem like Slade is betraying Oliver, he is not. Slade is telling Oliver exactly what to do, so they can all survive. Oliver executes the move perfectly. Just as Slade trained him.Source:   arrowsourceHe tosses Evelyn like a rag doll. It’s awesome. Also, physically speaking incredibly accurate because Amell is a mountain man compared to Madison McLaughlin. Source: arrowsourceThe little flick of the dagger to knock Talia’s arrow, and thus saving Samantha, is the precision we have come to expect from our hero.Oliver needs to focus on finding William, Diggle, Rene, Quentin and Dinah, so he asks Curtis, Thea, Samantha and Felicity to leave the island. Oh… don’t worry. We’re going to talk about Olicity. Next section. Hang tight.With a lull in the action, Slade wants to know what went down between Oliver and Chase. Oliver can’t understand why his past continues to come back to haunt him and Slade just decides to lay it out for him in plain English. It’s season finale time folks! No time for beating around the bush.Source:   1-crazy-dreamerSource:   olivergifsOliver: You say that like it’s easy.Slade: It’s the hardest thing in this world.I HAVE WAITED FIVE YEARS FOR THIS CONVERSATION. IT WAS WORTH EVERY SECOND. This is the shame that has defined Oliver Queen for ten years. It’s been a boulder around his neck and no matter how far he goes, there’s always some part of him that is still drowning. There is always some part of him that is in that boat with his dad. Robert Queen asked his son to survive and Oliver cannot forgive himself that he did. Oliver cannot forgive himself that his father had to die so he could live.Shame feeds into everything. It infects the very marrow of our bones until it becomes part of our DNA. Until, it starts to define who we are. Robert Queen’s death was first domino in a long line of death, pain and loss. It was the first domino of sin that kicked off all the others. Oliver chose to cheat on Laurel with Sara. He chose to get on the boat with Sara. This all lead to Robert’s death in Oliver’s mind and, in some respects, Oliver is right.However, if Oliver can forgive himself for Robert that will also be a domino effect. This guilt is the most difficult to let go of. Robert’s death is the one Oliver blames himself for above all others. But if Oliver can forgive himself for Robert’s death, if he can let the shame go, then the forgiveness will also be a domino effect in the same way the guilt was. It will be easier to forgive himself for all the other sins he carries. That’s why we’re focusing on Robert Queen again. This is where the pain started for Oliver. This is where it must end.It’s fitting for Slade to tell him. Oliver is a man now. The boy his was before Lian Yu is long gone. Yet, when it comes to our parents we will always be children. Oliver will always be that boy in the boat. Before Shado, Mirakuru and Moira, Slade Wilson was Oliver’s friend. What’s more, he was a father figure to Oliver when he needed one - much like Yao Fei. In fact, most of the friends Oliver encountered over those five years were surrogate fathers in their own way. Oliver was constantly searching for a way to connect to his father again, to stop missing what he lost and ease the pain.Slade knows Oliver. He was by his side those two years on the island. They spent countless nights by the fire. Slade understands Oliver’s guilt, because he carries it himself. Not simply for the things he did as Deathstroke, but for surviving too when Shado, and even Billy Wintergreen, did not.  It all comes down to high noon. Team Arrow and Team Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs face off.  Honestly, I needed commercial breaks just to breathe. The editing, cutting back and forth between flashbacks and present day, is seamless. The juxtaposition between Oliver fighting Chase and Oliver fighting Kovar is also extremely important. It’s similar to the way Arrow cut back and forth between Oliver’s fight with Slade in the past/present for 2x23 as well. The point is to highlight the different choices Oliver is about to make.There were two things Robert Queen asked of Oliver on that boat. The first was to right his wrongs. The second was to survive. Oliver has struggled for ten years to understand what those requests meant.When Oliver kills Kovar I believe he is killing out of survival. However, there is a difference between killing out of survival and killing out of revenge or retribution. It’s a delicate balance, one Oliver has struggled to find in himself. The truth is, he’s not on the island anymore. Killing is not the only means of survival and it is not the way justice is best served. Or at least… that’s not the justice Robert Queen was asking Oliver to bring to Starling City. Moral justification is not enough of a reason to end someone’s life. Oliver is being called to something greater than that. He was called in that boat. It’s simply taken him ten years to understand it.This all started because Robert Queen killed someone. Yes, it was an accident, but it doesn’t erase that he hid it. The shame followed Robert. It led to Merlyn and The Undertaking. Death begets death. This cycle all started with killing. So, killing is not the way to end it. Robert was asking his son to be a better man than he was. Robert was asking Oliver to find another way. Oliver does not kill Chase even though he is morally justified to do so. Chase kidnapped his son. He threatened everything most dear to Oliver. But see… that’s the point. Oliver began this season believing, because of Laurel’s death, that killing needed to be back on the table. As long as he was morally justified in taking a life then he should be willing to do what is necessary. Oliver believed taking a life will ultimately save lives. However, even though we may be morally justified in taking someone’s life it doesn’t mean that we SHOULD.  That’s the lesson Oliver has learned. There is another choice and… there is justice in that choice. Even more important is Oliver’s soul. He’s not a monster. He doesn’t enjoy killing, but every time he does it strips a piece of his soul. All of the men Oliver killed were evil. I believe the world would be better off without them. However, there is a cost to Oliver’s soul. There is a price Oliver and all those he loves will pay. That’s the cycle and it will only end when Oliver chooses differently. When Oliver finds another way. Oliver found another way not so long ago. He had the chance to show Slade Wilson mercy on the island and instead he chose to drive an arrow through is eye. There was a penance for that choice. When the time came for Oliver to choose again… he chose differently. Source:olivergifsOliver cannot kill Chase because then Adrian wins.  If he does, then Adrian’s truth is correct: All that exists in Oliver is darkness. He killed Adrian’s father. Oliver Queen killed his own father. He is death. But that’s a shame Oliver will no longer carry. Adrian can blame Oliver for his father’s death. Chase can carry that weight, but Oliver will no longer carry Robert’s suicide. He’s ready to let it go now. Source: @callistawolfMe:It’s a beautiful contrast to one of the most heartbreaking scenes of the episode. After Oliver is rescued he calls his mom.  And just like that… Moira is back. She is dressed in a beautiful black dress, on her way out to dinner. It’s like a freeze frame on how we began the series , to the way the Queen family was and everything Oliver has lost (and gained) since then. She doesn’t believe him at first, but then Moira listens to his voice.Source:   @callistawolfSource:   olivergifsOliver begs his mother not to hang up and everything he’s been shutting down for these past five years comes flooding back all at once. He’s a little boy again, who’s lost and just wants to come home to his mom. But then Moira asks the question.Oliver closes his eyes, tears streaming down his face. He can’t speak. This is the reason he couldn’t go home. This is why he couldn’t face his family. He’s been running from this call for five years. For so long, Oliver called it “the darkness” and said Moira and Thea wouldn’t recognize who he is. But the darkness is his shame. It is Robert Queen. Oliver couldn’t bear to tell his mother and sister that Robert is dead. No matter what Oliver does from now on he can never bring his father home.Source:  @callistawolfForgiveness is a grace. It’s a grace we give to others and it’s one we give to ourselves. We have to choose it like anything else. Oliver finally, after all these years, chooses to forgive himself for Robert’s death… and for what came after. This won’t be a onetime thing. Oliver will have to choose it every day, but the first time is the hardest. The guilt and shame falls like an anchor from his chest. We know it does because even when Adrian tells Oliver that William is dead he does not bend.Source: olivergifsHonestly I gasped. The mere thought of Oliver losing his son sent a chill down my spine. Anyone losing their child is an unthinkable horror. Even though we don’t know William well the moment still carried a significant emotional weight for me. Who is William? He is a child. An innocent. He is a piece of Oliver that is pure. It doesn’t matter that I haven’t seen episode after episode of Oliver parenting him. It doesn’t matter to me that I haven’t seen them playing catch or Felicity teaching William how to code. It doesn’t matter to me that I don’t know what William likes to play or what subjects he’s good at or if he’s funny. All of those details will come in time as Oliver embraces fatherhood in a different way. But the innocence of William will always be true. That will always be who he is and what he represents because that’s who all children are. That’s what all children represent.Stephen gives a powerhouse performance as he faces Adrian once again. He’s right to believe Adrian is manipulating him, but Oliver also acknowledges there exists the possibility that his son his dead. His voice shatters, the strength breaking from the thought of such an overwhelming grief. There could be no greater moral justification than taking the life of the person who took the life of your child.  Source: arrowsourceYet, even then Oliver refuses to kill Chase. Yes, because then Adrian would win but also because the cycle of death that started with Robert Queen needs to be broken.  A hero is called to be more than we believe we are capable of. A hero holds to a code, in the face of insurmountable odds, and refuses to bend. It is how they become the example, the beacon of light, for everyone else. Oliver holds to his code. He refuses to bend. Not even if his son is dead.Of course, Chase has a few final moves on the chess board left. He’s rigged the island to explode, but it’s a dead man’s trigger. If Oliver kills Chase then everyone dies. It’s such a poetically insane fruition to Chase’s plan.Oliver goes after William and they cut between him running through the woods in present day versus the flashback. Oliver is running to a boat in both instances. He’s running towards home in the past and the present. In the flashback, Oliver is running towards home with the weight of the past on his shoulders. Source: olivergifsIn the present, Oliver is running towards home, but is free of the past. He is running to the future. Except, William represents a future, a home, Oliver never dreamed possible five years ago.Oliver Queen always had a light inside him. He always believed that it was the darkness that helped him survive, but now he understands differently. Oliver embraces the truth of who he is.  He is not a killer. Not anymore. He’s become someone else… he’s become something else. That man has the strength to let the guilt go. That man has the will to show mercy to his enemies. That man has the courage to love without fear of loss. That man doesn’t just want to survive. He wants to live.We started this journey with Oliver Queen running through a darkened forest and igniting a fire. It was a signal to the boat, but also a symbol of his rebirth. The fires of Purgatory made him something new, but his journey wasn’t over. He was just beginning.Source: @callistawolfNow, we are watching Oliver run through a forest of light. The sun beams down on him as he chases after his son. Oliver Queen has chosen life in every way possible. This is the evolution we’ve waited for.  It’s the man Robert Queen never imagined, yet always believed Oliver could become. It’s the man Robert gave his life for. There is nothing but light because Oliver is that light. He is The Green Arrow. It means Oliver is ready for one final test. One final choice. Oliver and Prometheus battle on a boat, where this all began. Chase leads them out into the very same waters where Robert Queen died and brings out William. Oliver’s terror chokes in his throat and he holds the arrow on Chase, but his hand is shaking.   Source:olivergifsHe’s been here before. Oliver lost his innocence in this very same spot. It hollowed him out and he’s fought for ten years to claw his way back. Now, he’s facing that loss again. Only this time he is not the son. He is the father.Chase remarks how Oliver only seems concerned about William despite his entire team trapped on the island facing certain death. This is an extremely smart writing choice. It addresses the “What about Felicity?” and “What about Diggle?” questions head on. Oliver tells Chase his team can handle themselves. This is a moment of monumental growth for Oliver. There was a time Oliver couldn’t fathom trusting anyone out of fear of losing them.  Now, Oliver puts his faith in his team. He believes they can save themselves. He entrusts his heart into their hands. Oliver is also acknowledging they are all soldiers. Felicity, Diggle, Quentin, Thea, Curtis, Rene and Dinah chose this life.  Oliver respects their choice. William chose nothing. I firmly believe every single team member, INCLUDING FELICITY,  would tell Oliver to choose his son. Every team member would take a bullet for William or any child for that matter. They are heroes. And no, Samantha is not a member of Team Arrow. She didn’t choose this life, but she is William’s mother. She will gladly give up her life for him. Oliver is exactly where he needs to be.Chase gives Oliver the choice. Save William by killing Chase and therefore his entire team OR let Chase kill William and the team survives.  Oliver faced a similar choice with Moira and Thea with Slade. Slade was driven by revenge, fueled by an intense grief over the loss of Shado. Even in all his madness, there was humanity in that evil. But Chase? He’s only driven by the hollow truth he lives by - that Oliver Queen is a monster. This isn’t about revenge over his father. Chase believes Oliver freed him with that act. He could become who he was meant to be. Now, Chase wants to return the favor. He wants to reveal who Oliver truly is. Adrian simply wants to be proven right. There is no humanity in Sam Morrison. Oliver refused to choose between Moira and Thea, so his mother chose for him. Oliver and Felicity found another way. They always had the upper hand with Slade. This time is different. Chase has the upper hand. The choice is Oliver’s and his alone.So much of Oliver’s life is made up of these moments. Times when he wished he’d gone left instead of right. Choosing between who lives and who dies. It’s been ten years of making these choices and learning from them. Part of the challenge of being a hero, being worthy of the mantle, is to find a way out when your back is against the wall. When presented with Option A or B, a hero has to find C. That’s what Oliver failed to do in Season 4… and it’s what he does now. He lowers the bow, seemingly like the choice is made. Oliver is going to let Chase kill his son… but then he fires. It’s not a kill shot.  Source: itbericeIt goes into Adrian’s foot, but it’s enough to give Oliver the chance to pull William away. Oliver doesn’t make a choice between William and his team. He finds another way.Source:   olivergifsOliver holding William makes me so emotional.  Oliver lost his father, but he saved his son.  Also, points for wearing a green hoodie William. I like you kid.Source:   songbinBut Adrian Chase punishes Oliver for refusing to choose.  He whispers to Oliver about how much he and William will need each other. How lonely it will be without Mom… and Felicity. Then Chase puts a gun to his head and pulls the trigger.  It’s a horrific parallel to the same choice Robert Queen made. Only Robert killed himself to save Oliver’s life. Source:   olivergifsAdrian Chase kills himself to destroy Oliver’s life. Source:  songbin The flash of Chase’s gun reflects in Oliver’s eyes and the horror of what is about to happen hits him. Oliver turns, holding his son, and watches as Lian Yu, the island called Purgatory, bursts into flames and takes everyone Oliver loves with it.  A final recompense for Oliver’s sins? (Shh… no. Hang in there with me.)The boy, who lost his father, now is the father with only his boy.source:   itberice What makes this tragedy all the worse is that Oliver is finally ready to be the brother, friend and husband he is meant to be. The weight that held him back from the future he is meant to have, with the  family he fought so hard to build, is gone. In the moment Oliver is free, in the moment he is truly home, he loses everything again.So that’s it huh? Blew up the cast. Game over. Thanks a lot Arrow.HA. Right. Come on kiddos. Don’t tell me you buy that for a hot second. There’s more to it.  I raised you better. This idea of blowing up the cast (via boat and not island) bounced around the fandom for awhile and I always had a beef with it because… HOW IS THAT A CLIFFHANGER? I still hold to that beef. (Not with those who had the idea, but simply from a writing standpoint).  I believe Marc has confirmed Emily, David, Paul and Willa will all be back for Season 6 on his Tumblr. (I’m too lazy to look for it, but it’s there folks.) So, we know they survive. It doesn’t make for much of a cliffhanger.Well… unless the question isn’t who survived, but rather HOW they survive. Admittedly, Samantha, Slade and Evelyn are all possible fatalities, but the series regulars are safe. I am confident about that. That’s where things get interesting though. That’s where Arrow reveals a potential long game that’s been a few years in the making. If I’m right. So, how does Team Arrow survive?Slade Wilson.There has been ONE villain Oliver Queen has not killed. Despite being absolutely morally justified in killing him, Oliver showed Slade mercy. And why? Because he made a promise to Tommy. Because Felicity believed he could find another way. Oliver held to that promise and that belief in the face of crushing rage and grief. And in the end… found the way.Oliver began this season believing killing was necessary. He chose not to kill Damien Darhk and Laurel died. Therefore, killing had to be back on the table to save lives. To make sure what happened to Laurel never happened to anyone else he loves.But what if… the opposite is true? What if mercy offers Oliver that same opportunity? What if mercy can also save lives? Slade’s desire for redemption is clear. He more than proved his loyalty to Oliver in “Lian Yu.” Slade protects Felicity. He refuses to leave without Oliver and William. And… nobody knows this island better. It’s a move on the chess board Adrian Chase couldn’t have foreseen because it’s something a man like Chase could never understand. The one villain Oliver offered life to will be the man who saves the lives of everyone he holds dear. Oliver found another way three years before Prometheus ever came into their lives and that choice is what will beat Adrian in the end. Oliver will return to the island. He will not leave without being sure. He won’t leave another body behind on the island that already took so many. When Oliver does he will find his loved ones and the lesson that’s been years in the making. Life begets life.Source:   queensarrowOlicityOh the FEELS. I LIVE FOR THIS ANGSTY SHIT!!!Listen, the point of Season 5 was for Oliver to finally get his crap together so he could be ready for a relationship with Felicity Smoak. Felicity had some stuff to work on her end too, don’t get me wrong, but it was mostly Oliver.So, I wasn’t expecting too much of an Olicity focus simply because we needed to close out this five year journey and Oliver’s emotional baggage. This puts a big spotlight on Oliver for the finale, which I’m fine with. I had different goals for 5x23. I wanted emotional resolution on all the stuff I just spent 15 pages talking about. Felicity is the future and “Lian Yu” is very much about Oliver dealing with the past, so he can be ready for that future. BUT I am extremely happy with the Olicity scene we did get. Oliver finds his girl, of course, but the fact that he’s aligned with the man who put a sword to her throat does not go unnoticed.Source:   westallenolicitygifsOh how I love a communicative Olicity. Also, Felicity is the boss. Never forget it.Oliver tells Malcolm to get them off the island, but Felicity doesn’t want to leave Oliver. But he can’t risk her. Source:    sharingmyworld Oh… I will never grow tired of the 2x23 dance. Let us waltz this waltz forever with my loves.This time is a little different than 2x23. William is a factor and Oliver needs to focus on finding his son. He can’t do that if he’s worrying about Felicity and if she’s on the island then he’s going to be worrying about her. That puts both their lives in danger. Just jump into Oliver’s waking nightmare. Oliver is all business at first, giving Felicity detailed imagery of the island “just in case.” Felicity hesitates for just a moment, but then she stands on her tiptoes (I love that she has to do that) and pulls Oliver to her. It’s a sweet and gentle kiss. Oliver is surprised at first, but in spite of the madness surrounding them, he allows himself a moment. A moment to breathe her in and to feel her lips against his. He’s missed her. He’s missed this. Lian Yu melts away and it’s just the two of them again. When it ends, the “all business” approach is gone. He’s her Oliver. He softens his voice, to the tone that’s reserved just for Felicity. There’s a little smile playing on his lips, but he can’t hide his surprise. So much for hypothetically dating huh big fella?Source:   gothsmoakFelicity is scared. Oliver reassures her that they will make it through, but Felicity is right. He can’t know that.    Source:amanitacaplanThey’ve both made their fair share of mistakes, but not kissing Oliver is one Felicity won’t allow. She won’t regret that. YOUR OTP COULD NEVERFeeling regretful is a natural part of rebuilding. You wish you said and did things differently. It can take awhile to realize that maybe it all happened the way it was supposed to. That the lessons you learned from the breaking were just as important if you had never broken at all.What does Felicity regret? Closing the door forever. For losing faith Oliver could change. Not telling Oliver she was leaving the door open for them. Dating Billy. (Alright that one might be mine.) Pushing him away because she was hurt and angry. Wasting so much time because she was terrified to get hurt again.It doesn’t mean Felicity should regret all of this. It’s simply where her mind and heart is right now. And yes… Oliver has regrets too. We spent a lot of time on them from 5x17-5x23, so Imma gonna skip the gifs.It’s why he tells Felicity they will talk about it when find their way off the island…. when they go home. Together. It’s such a beautifully soft and tender moment. A gentle reminder to Oliver of everything he is fighting to save.  Source: underconstruction87Slade is wildly interested in Oliver’s personal life. He can’t understand how Oliver married Ra’s Al Ghul’s daughter and not “the blonde.” Welcome to the fandom Wilson. Bar in the back. We’ve been getting boozy over 3x22 for awhile now. Oliver says Nyssa talks too much, but Slade is all, “TELL ME MORE."" It’s like his own personal version of Days of Our Lives. I mean… the guy has gone without television for awhile. While we’re on the subject, he’d like to know what’s happening on Days of Our Lives. We also had a long awaited conversation between Felicity and Samantha. Felicity stating again how she wasn’t in favor of Oliver sending William away, but then pointedly adding that she wasn’t consulted, gives me life. It pretty much sums up the break up too, which is why it’s funny to me that Felicity tells Samantha it’s ""complicated."" No precious unicorn. That’s about the it. I think Felicity is being gracious because she has to co-parent with this woman. If you want to talk reasons for Oliver and Felicity breaking up, let’s start with your RIDICULOUS AND ILLOGICAL ultimatum Samantha.  Pause. I have to start doing my breathing exercises. Otherwise I slip back into 4x08 Ragey Jen.  Okay, I’m good.Source:   felicitysSeriously, everybody ships these two. One kiss and Samantha is sold. Bar is in the back honey. Slade is drinking a Mai Tai with Diggle and Curtis.I was sent some of tweets about Samantha being jealous. She wasn’t jealous. I vehemently disagree. Perhaps she was exhausted from being held in a cage, sick of walking through the woods and worried to death about William. But I am confident there are no ""feelings” for Oliver there. Samantha is simply pointing out the obvious. There is so much love between Oliver and Felicity and that love can conquer whatever is “complicated.” PREACH MY SISTER. Keep talking like this and stop complicating things for my babies with your crazy ultimatums and you can stay.The final scene with Chase is eerily horrifying because we know what’s going to happen.  We know just as Oliver has become the man Felicity knew he always could be… he’s going to lose her.Robert Queen’s final word was, “Survive."" Chase’s final word is a name, ""Felicity."" The pairing in the parallel is clear. Felicity is where the road to survival led. Their love brought Oliver back to life. Source:   feilcityqueenChase posed the Thea versus Felicity question to Oliver. While I believe Oliver cannot live without either of these women, Chase answers it. Adrian knows Oliver. He knows that when the day is over, and William is asleep in bed, the loneliness will settle in. Oliver will ache to hold Felicity and hear the sound of voice. Thea is Oliver’s family, but Felicity is his life. She is the life Oliver secretly dreamed of, but never thought possible. He wanted to raise William with her, have children with her, and grow old with her.  And in flash… she’s gone. Source: gothsmoak Yeah… except she’s not. We know she’s not because Arrow is not insane. We’re going to tune in for Season 6 and watch as Oliver reunites with the love of his life, after thinking she died, AND we’ll be in a 9 pm time slot baby!!!It’s been a long road back to Oliver and Felicity, but I believe it was worth every step of the journey. Even the wildly frustrating ones. If Arrow paralleling Robert Queen’s ""survive” with the final word spoken at the end of this five year journey (“Felicity”) does not confirm their endgame status to you then honestly folks… I do not know what will. Felicity was always the last piece to this puzzle. When Oliver and Felicity are reunited next season they will finally begin to live that puzzle, the whole picture, in the life they build together.Malcolm Merlyn and Thea QueenSource: arrowsourceOh Thea. Never change. As predicated, Merlyn goes out in a blaze of glory. He takes Thea’s place on the landmine. His speech to her is moving and, despite being super evil, pretty accurate about parenthood.The death happens off screen, and Merlyn is the magician after all, so I’m always a little wary. We’ve danced this dance before Arrow! However, given that the entire island blew up I feel it’s safe to say that Merlyn is dead. It’s fitting too. He’s the reason Oliver ended up on Lian Yu. This should be the place Malcolm Merlyn dies. Malcolm took Oliver’s father from him, but his death saves his sister. He is also able to give Thea what he was never able to give Tommy - he put his child above his own desires. Source: zorro-ritaOf course, Merlyn goes out like the bad ass motherfucker he is - taking Digger and a bunch of LOA members with him. My sincerest hope is the character remains dead. I love John Barrowman, but Merlyn has reached the finish line. This is a necessary end to the villain who started it all. It’s a good death.Thea’s emotional conflict over Merlyn’s death is played out so beautifully by Willa Holland. This is what Doug Ross (ER) had to say after his father died:“I hated the son of a bitch and I loved him.”Pretty much sums up Thea and Merlyn for me. Thea shares her emotional turmoil with Felicity. She lists all the horrible things Malcolm has done, but she cannot help missing him. No one understands more than Felicity Smoak. Her own father is quite a piece of work too. Felicity gently tells Thea that yes, her father was super evil, but he loved her in his own way.    Source:amanitacaplanThen, she kisses Thea on the forehead and hugs her. This is the sisterly bonding I need.My hope is with Merlyn’s death that Thea is freed from some of her pain in the same way Oliver is freed from his. By sacrificing himself for his daughter, hopefully Thea can see there can be good even in a monster.  If there can be goodness in a man like Malcolm Merlyn, then Thea has no reason to fear what is inside her.Nyssa and Talia Al GhulThe action and fight sequences are exceptional in “Lian Yu” (ALL THE PRAISE JAMES BAMFORD), but I have to say one of my favorite fights is  between Nyssa and Talia Al Ghul. This is the heavy weight fight I waited all season for. Talia obviously has her issues with Nyssa for aligning with Oliver Queen. However, I’m glad Arrow took the time for Nyssa to outline her issues with Talia. Source:   itbericeShe essentially abandoned Nyssa to their tyrant father because Talia craved power.  We’re all aware of Ra’s Ah Ghul’s stance on Nyssa’s sexuality, so growing up with that man had to be a nightmare. A nightmare Talia may have been able to ease if she put family over power.   TEAM NYSSA ALL THE WAY!   The kicking of Talia’s ass was one of the episode highlights for me.Source:   sonadorasBl*ck S*ren and Bl*ck C*nary.The Screaming Canaries is another showdown highlight.  I know who my Canary is!!! Source:   sharingmyworldTheir canary cries canceling each other out is pretty hilarious though.BS is straight up evil in the finale, as predicted.  She gave zero fucks about Oliver and did nothing to help anyone. Villain, villain, villain and a bumbling one at that! Slade tricks her into believing he is on Chase’s team, which gives Oliver the opportunity to give Dinah her canary collar thing. This is good. Let’s keep this up for S6.No joke, I legit SCREAMED when this happened.Source: sharingmyworldSO. MUCH. GLORIOUSNESS. It’s bloody fantastic Quentin Lance anoints Dinah Drake as the Bl*ck C*nary and in the episode she’s facing off with BS. This entire exchange is so much GOLD. Source:   lindsayshalsteadBAM.   Bitch goes down!!!!“FOR SO MANY REASONS.”Arrow never grows tired of shading the haters and if these are the scenes we’re going to get now that KC is back then consider me SOLD. This is going to be so much fun.If any Felicity Smoak hater comes into your yard blustering about Arrow blowing her up, simply remind them they blew up their fave AGAIN. Except not a single character cares. Well, first apply logic and tell them neither character was blown up. But when that inevitably fails use the above argument.Stray ThoughtsPretty seamless transition from this finale to the pilot. Although, I have questions for Oliver’s hairdresser. Did Oliver pay the hairdresser off when he/she removed the wig?Let’s talk about the smoke trick thing. Is there a trap door? The smoke doesn’t travel far enough for them to run even 100 feet. WHERE DO THEY GO?  Helicopter can’t make a single shot. Oliver takes down in one. Oh TV I love you.“If it’s anything like the three gulf streams I used to have, yes.” Malcolm continues to be a 1%er asshole up until the end. Points for consistency. Oliver asking Thea to keep Samantha and Felicity safe makes me emotional. There’s no one Oliver trusts more with his future wife. QUEEN SIBILINGS FOREVER. Curtis keeps Felicity safe? Hmmm. Nice try. More like the other way around, but okay Arrow.“Sort of a sweet kid actually. You sure he’s yours?” Chase you are an evil dick of the supreme order, but I will miss your Joker level loony tunes. Josh Segarra was phenomenal. BEST. VILLAIN. EVER.Source:   sharingmyworldRene being supportive is cute. They can date next year. I’m down.Protective Father Oliver is hot.They didn’t want to let go. I’m not crying. There’s just something in my eye. *sniffie* Source: songbinWe blew up Lian Yu. It would have been way more awesome (and far less terrifying) if all my children weren’t on it, but I’m willing to recognize blowing up the island is the shit.So a couple ideas for 6x01. I think the team either made it to the bunker or to the plane. My bet is we’ll see how they survive and then there’s a five month time jump. IF there are flashbacks they might be  immediately post 5x23. I guarantee you there are pilot/finale parallels I missed. I am perfectly okay with that.Season 5 wrap up will be coming later!
