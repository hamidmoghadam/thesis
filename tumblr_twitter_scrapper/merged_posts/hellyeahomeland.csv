Some levity and lightness. At this point it’s been nearly five weeks since the season ended and we’re feeling a bit talked out. Enter #askchallenge2k17. Homeland canon (and sometimes beyond) has amassed a fairly impressive array of reaction gifs to choose from. There’s almost one for any mood, occasion, and yes… ask. Starting today and over the next week we’re challenging ourselves (and you guys… kinda) to answer asks in only gifs or pics. The only rule is that it’s gotta be semi-relevant (but I gave everyone a fair warning that they were inviting me to be irreverent and aloof). Because what better place to look for answers than straight from the source? " True text

Did I just happen upon it, one lazy October day, or did it, by some magical stroke of fate, draw me to it?Regardless of the answer to that question, there is no question I love this show. Unequivocally, and irrevocably, I love it. I like to think that unbridled, unfettered love is what drew some of you to reading, however long ago. There is real truth in passion and love, and I hope that is shown in what I’ve done here. This show and this place have actually changed my life. They reignited parts of me that had fallen dormant and sparked things inside me that I didn’t know I had the capacity to hold.From that love, this blog was born, now almost four years ago. To describe it as just a “blog” seems not enough right now. It was–and is–so much more than that. I’ve poured my heart and my soul into this thing. At times, I’ve poured my own sanity (sorry). Through personal upheaval and major life changes, this space has remained a constant, steadying presence. I asked myself, I wonder what you all thought? I wonder what you had to say about what I thought? I felt reassured, in times of great uncertainty, by the thought, the conviction, the promise that as much as I loved this show there were others out there who loved it as I did. I didn’t feel that closeness, that unity behind a shared love and passion, until I came here. You may have noticed I’ve been relatively quiet around here over the last two weeks. That I’ve mostly retreated, resurfacing to offer words of diplomacy, words of “I hope” and “can we all just agree that…” That I’ve sometimes sidestepped discussions of the narrative’s flaws; of real-life events that may have precipitated that narrative; and of overall commentary (or lack thereof) by the major players in various media in the aftermath of the finale. If you can understand the love that I have for this television series, in many ways that are difficult to articulate, then maybe you understand my need for it not to be what it is now. Which feels like something horrible and broken and false, an ugly lie. For it to be anything else would mean that I have sunk years of my life into something that turned out to be just not worth the time. A broken promise. To even dwell on that makes me sadder than I’m able to say. It would be a lie still to deny that the negativity and pain and hurt and anger–though deserved–building up around this show, as evident through the words on this blog, don’t make me feel deeply uncomfortable. They follow me like a dark cloud over this thing I’ve created. I wonder, has this all been for naught? Has this all been a terrible, terrible lie? If you have asked yourself why I haven’t unleashed, why I’ve tempered your anger and offered meager attempts at empathy, and why I’ve (until now) held it together, this is the answer. I’ve felt lately like I’ve been treading murky waters. But to do otherwise is to give in to that lie. To accept it as the truth. Many of you are already there. You may be stronger and more honest than I am. But I’m not there, not yet. And I’ll fight hard to keep my head above water. " True text

Skinny Lattes and Silly Sticks by littlemisfit5290 is the epitome of short and sweet, as Fara joins Max on a trip to the local Langley coffee spot (read: Starbucks).There is something undeniably hilarious about Max fetching a massive Starbucks order for Carrie, Saul, & co, while simultaneously suffering from open-mouth-insert-foot during a conversation with Fara.

If our answers are sometimes repetitive, it’s because the asks sometimes are.Discussion: Please consider a visit to Homelandand Stuff LJ community here if you want some interaction with people who feel like you do. Anons are always welcome. It has helped some of us in coping with this latest episode and season six as a whole.Fan Fic: We know some of you are not fan fic readers, but reading alternate interpretations, often with happier endings, really can help. Some of us started reading fic after “A False Glimmer” (i.e., the first time we thought Quinn was gone) and it was incredibly helpful. You can find the entire collection here, and a comprehensive list by topics is on our Hiatus List of Things to Tackle. Petition: @keepcalmandquarrieon‘s petition is still live and has hundreds of signatures. It’s here. It’s become less of a “bring back Quinn” movement and more a place for fans to express their outrage with the hope that Showtime will take notice. Have your voice heard: you can sign anonymously, and it takes less than a minute.The Future: Sara will address this later in more depth but for now, while this fandom will undoubtedly change in the coming weeks, months, and (gosh, can it really be that long) years, we wanted to offer a few reasons to stick around: This community here is a great one, and the discussion that’s fostered since the finale has helped us (and we hope all who are reading) a lot. We intend to keep that dialogue going. We will continue to post any Showtime news. Keep in mind we didn’t get anything from Gansa until about a month after the season five finale. We will keep a close a eye on how Quinn’s legacy–for both Carrie and the narrative at large–is depicted in season seven. We all feel this is extremely important. We plan to continue celebrating Quinn and will also be keeping tabs on Rupert’s career goings-on as we make a larger shift to covering the entire cast’s career moves beyond this show throughout the hiatus and beyond. As always, thank you for reading.

Maybe he died in that gas chamber, really and truly. After that, “Quinn 1.0,” as we came to identify him, was but a distant memory. Quinn 2.0, the Peter Quinn we saw this season, was in some respects worlds apart from that man. I will not rattle off the list because we know it well. We saw him struggle, we saw him fight, we saw both his slowly boiling rage at his slow recovery as well as his eventual resignation that this might be the end for him. This is what matters, ultimately. He was a hero, in life and in death. He loved fully, with his whole heart and without abandon. He was totally and completely committed to his country and to those he loved. He kept a tattered copy of Great Expectations in his dresser, seemingly took it with him everywhere he went. It was filled with photos of Julia, the mother of his child; John, the son he never knew; and Carrie, the woman whom he loved as no other.That’s tragedy. To call it anything else would be a lie. I wasn’t expecting to have to write this. I spoke confidently that he would be fine. That the forces that kept him alive last year (and the year before, and the year before that) would keep him alive this year. I was wrong. So now we grieve. I think that everyone will process this death in different ways. Already I have seen reactions of anger, confusion, and abject sadness. In the coming days and weeks we will be open to all these reactions, because that’s what a community is for. In the meantime, if you need to take a break, that’s ok. If you need to say goodbye, that’s ok, too. If and when you decide to come back, HYH will be here. " True text

We have a tie-breaker question at the end in case Sara’s math turns out to be horrifically off. If it comes to it, we’ll choose winners based on how close you were on this question (so be descriptive!).  After the episode we’ll tally up everyone’s points and then declare the winners. The poll will close Sunday night at 2pm EDT (what time is that for me?), which means you’ll have two extra hours to reflect on all the choices you should have made before the finale airs. (If the finale ends up leaking, we’ll close the poll right away, so there’s value in not wasting time entering!) One entry per person**, please. Anything seriously fishy will be disqualified.

After ten episodes of miscommunication, they tell each other some truths, at last. The drama was intense, the scenes were very harsh… Did you think it was well done?  Ashley (@ascloseasthis): Well done? Let’s just say that my expectations were exponentially lowered by Cynthia texting “HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE THIS SHOW IS HATE I HATE IT” before I got a chance to watch it.Sydney (@SNQA303): I hated the monkey scene. It completely took me out of the show. It felt humiliating for Quinn and Rupert.Julie (@gabehcoud): I felt paralyzed watching it.Sara (@carriemathison): I thought it was FASCINATING, the same way I find Carrie’s outbursts at the end of “The Vest” fascinating. Or her sticking her tongue out at Jonas. Quinn is tired, he’s furious at Carrie, he’s trapped in a body that does not feel his…Laure: I thought that scene was brilliant too. Pure suffering. Quinn is feeling like an animal, subhuman. And that’s the way he expresses it. Sydney: It made me feel uncomfortable for Rupert… which means I wasn’t thinking about Quinn in that moment.Ashley: Sure, Quinn has never been super great at expressing himself verbally. But what made that so uncomfortable was fact that it went on SO LONG.Frangi (@Frangipaniflower001): You both used the word “uncomfortable.” But that’s just it: we feel uncomfortable exploring a weak Quinn.Sara: Ding ding ding! Do we need the rest of this debate? Frangi just summed it up perfectly. And personally, I’ve found Quinn’s descent and downward spiral this year to be quite fascinating and a needed re-energizer of his character.Laure: Ok… What about that scene in general? Frangi: Putting Carrie to sleep all night was ridiculous and out of character.Cynthia (@lange-c): We just deserved more. They were there overnight. I guess my point is this – the writers can be withholding and fuck around with Quinn’s character all they want but there has been zero viewer reward this year.Sara: That’s probably true. But were there ever any illusions about this being a show where viewer reward is priced highly? Quinn being angry at Carrie and having that outburst is what is deserved. You guys think it was humiliating for him, maybe it was, but it was cathartic. Cynthia: We’ve seen enough of his dehumanization.Sara: Carrie needed to absorb that. She didn’t leave, she stayed the night. She loves him. Laure: You know this is going to be posted, right?Sara: Why do y'all always make me defend Quinn and CQ this season? I’m losing my edge!Part Two: A Real GlimmerLaure: Speaking of which - did Carrie convey effectively her affection for Quinn in that episode? Did Quinn hear it? Cynthia: No.Frangi: Yes.Ashley: No. Quinn wasn’t listening.Sara: Yes. Carrie did convey her affection, in her own Carrie way. Telling him to shut the fuck up was the most beautiful thing that’s happened on this show for me in a long time.Ashley: Quinn literally wasn’t listening to Carrie. He’s so deep in self-pity and revenge and fury — all of which are valid, obviously — that he doesn’t have room for anything else. Sydney: Quinn did hear it. He thought it through overnight and realized he didn’t blame Carrie. That’s why he said “let me go.” Laure: Ah, the infamous, “you have to let me go.” It’s scaring everybody, including me. And that damn light! What does it mean for Quinn?Ashley: He’s a goner. Watching him say “let me go” and then literally go into the light, which is a classic metaphor for death, felt ominous.Sara: The light saved him last year. This show mixes its metaphors. I liked one of the theories we got via ask… which said Quinn came back in through the light (the door) when Carrie was being attacked by Belli. Sydney: The light can represent light, not darkness or death. It can be rebirth…Ashley: No. This whole season has been about acceptance. Laure: Oh, this is a very clever point, Ashley.Sara: Acceptance that Quinn 1.0 is gone, sure. But Quinn 2.0 survives. And realistically, killing Quinn at this juncture makes no sense to me. They would have done so last year.Laure: Unless… Ashley is right, the season is about acceptance, and it’s a meta story, from the writers to us, saying, “Viewers, you have to accept Quinn is gone.” Carrie has to let him go, and we have to as well. Frangi: God.Laure: This the most depressing debate ever!Ashley: Well, you picked the topic.Laure: It gets better, I swear. Ashley: The debate? How do you know?Laure: I’m a time traveler. I edit this in the future.Part Three: Explosions and ReconciliationsLaure: What do you think of the episode’s ending, with the explosion? Was it rushed? Was it beautiful? Does the hug means Carrie and Quinn are reconciled?Sara: Definitely not (for the last question).Ashley: They need a lot of time and therapy and alcohol before they are going to be fully reconciled. But I liked the ending. I liked how they physically came together and then separated but were still in sync. Sydney: I think they will work together at this point. Quinn won’t leave Carrie on her own.Ashley: Something has to happen in the finale. I don’t want to know what – hell, I don’t even particularly want to watch it.Cynthia: I think Carrie will “let him go”Sydney: Let’s hope “let him go” doesn’t mean “let him die”, but just that Quinn will leave the country.Frangi: The passport was there for a reason.Sara: They will put an “emotional ellipsis” on their storyline this season next week. I’m 150,000% sure of it.Laure: Can you elaborate?Sara: The Carie/Quinn relationship has been the emotional thesis statement of the entire season. There’s no way they can’t confront it. If they’re not it’s an unsuccessful finale.Ashley: And Homeland never had an unsuccessful finale…Sara: Are you being facetious? “Marine One” is without flaws.Ashley: I’m being facetious, but think about 5.12… which was a train wreck. Complete with a train.Laure: I’d compare the monkey scene to the season five finale, actually. They made me sick… but they were so bold. I admire them both, in retrospect. Ashley: 5.12 brought us all together, so… FUCK this show, but I guess it’s fine.Sara: The writers will put some sort of punctuation on Carrie and Quinn journey together in S6, which has been about Carrie accepting Quinn as he is now, Quinn accepting himself, Carrie coming to terms with her guilt, Quinn realizing he needs to commit to his own healing and therapy and Carrie giving him the space to do that in peace… And them both confirming their romantic love for each other in a way that is not suffocating for either of them.Laure: Wow. Sara: … but they will leave it open-ended, hence the ellipsis. They’ll set it up for S7.Laure: How optimistic of you, Sara! We’ll close the debate on that beautiful note.Sydney: No! Ashley’s “Fuck this show” is a much better ending.Ashley: You know, I’m proud of that.Post ScriptSydney: So? The debate is over? Laure’s not watching anymore? Ok. Next season, Quinn’s arm will be amputated. Don’t put that on Tumblr.Cynthia: Yes! Let’s start removing body parts. With paring knives. And people will say it’s an act of fucking love. Laure is gone, right? That’s not being posted?Frangi: No. She’s gone.Sydney: The show is too dark. Gansa is the one who needs to walk into the light." True text

What do you think will be more meaningful, narratively speaking? Sex vs “I love you”?               Sara (@carriemathison): An “I love you”… by about 8500 times. Does anyone honestly think otherwise?                        Cynthia: But… don’t we already know they love each other?                        Sara: I do. Others doubt it.                        Cynthia: How does saying it make a difference if we already know they love each other?                      Sara: Well… there is a debate about love vs. in love. If Carrie tells him that she loves him I would take that as an “I am in love with you.” BRIEF HISTORY LESSON: This side of two seasons of ago, between 4.10 and 4.11, there was similar unease around what Carrie actually felt for Quinn. There were a lot fewer people then who believed sincerely that Carrie loved Quinn (and rightly so). But in 4.10 she says to him, after he tells her he’s going after Haqqani, ""you will die trying, or worse, and I won’t allow it.” This was after nearly a full season of Carrie acting and talking as if she couldn’t give two shits about his well-being. But literally ZERO PEOPLE thought that 4.11 would play out like it did, with basically a Carrie Mathison-esque admission that she loved him. She talks constantly about losing him, or not being able to lose him, and then she finally just fucking says it: “I don’t wanna lose you.” It took a lot of people in the fandom by surprise because it was so forward. We were all very used to having to interpret stolen glances or offhand remarks, but this was like a conscious tell on behalf of the writers that Carrie’s feelings were deeper. Then the kiss happened, and I can tell you that exactly ZERO PEOPLE thought that would happen as well. The question now is whether she’s in love with him? And, does she desire a romantic relationship with him? She would only tell him the former if she wanted the latter.                                             Cynthia: Okay, to confirm, what makes an “I love you” expressed more explicitly by Carrie more meaningful is that it will finally confirm the in love question for you (and us)?                        Sara: Assuming it’s in the context I expect, yes. I think if she says “I love you” it will be very clear that she’s in love with him. It all depends on the context in which it’s said.                       Cynthia: Got it! Let’s talk about how Quinn would react. I could see him being rejecting, actually. What say you?                        Sara: OH GOD                        Sara: 😖  << literally just made that face                        Cynthia: I think we’re an emoji free blog, aren’t we? 😝                        Sara: Not when the time calls for it!!                        Sara: My original answer before you got me thinking about rejection (which would feel very tiresome tbh) was that he would react similarly to how he did in 4.10, when she says “I won’t allow it.” He was, like, stunned speechless then. I always get the feeling that Quinn has no idea how Carrie feels about him (which is ironic and quite a reversal). So I could see that. Especially since in many of their earlier interactions this season, Carrie was either detached or… cryptic. It would be a nice follow-up to the “why” scene.                        Cynthia: I never thought about that but, yes! It would circle back and answer that question. That feels very Gansa-esque.                        Sara: That was the unspoken reason why and very “of the show” that they just left it unsaid. However, if people are expecting an “I believe I was put on this earth for our paths to cross”-type declaration, they’re not gonna get it. interestingly, i don’t think Carrie ever told Brody she loved him. Or he her.      Cynthia: Well, arguably, “I believe I was put on this earth for our paths to cross” is more epic than “I love you”…                        Sara: Yeah, I agree. That was my point.                        Sara: I’m refraining from getting into Carrie/Brody here because I know that’s not why people are reading                        Cynthia: Too late. We’re going there.                        Cynthia: I don’t want to go down the CB rabbit hole but I wondered if you had any thoughts on CB vs. CQ this season as it relates to love declarations and sex. There are a ton of easy parallels–intensity, wounded warrior. The writers have been pretty explicit. But the men are very different (selfish vs. unselfish) and sex has been very different.                  Sara: Yeah… they never portrayed bad sexual situations with Carrie and Brody. By all accounts the sex was great between them. I’m comparing that to the post-nightmare “hug” in 6.03.                        Sara: After The Kiss in 4.12 people made a point about Carrie pulling away from their kiss. It was almost an exact mirror to Carrie and Brody’s kiss in 1.06 considering the setting, etc. But the fact that she pulled away signaled to many that she really wanted to get this right. Cynthia: And she’s a different girl in many respects now…                        Sara: At that point, Quinn was much more of a tangible possibility in terms of their life together that it was important for her to not rush into anything and not repeat past mistakes. This ties into Claire’s comments about Carrie never really believing in the reality of a life with Brody, which is why she could do the things she did. It was never going to really happen. What’s really interesting to me is that that has somewhat changed in the two seasons since. Is a life with Quinn really a tangible possibility at this point? That’s kinda fascinating. And if that’s where they’re going with this it would be so tragic but also pretty interesting. It would say a lot about what we can expect in the last two seasons.                    Cynthia : I’ve always thought Carrie has a savior complex. There’s no way Quinn is gonna let that be part of their romantic dynamic…                        Sara: I agree re: savior complex. That IMO would be a major source of tension in a potential relationship between them. I think he would fight back but she would fight harder.                        Sara: Consider this: The writers are manufacturing a Carrie/Brody relationship in reverse with Carrie/Quinn but are going to let the viewers actually see how something like that would have played out.                        Cynthia: Ah… that’s fantastic insight.                        Sara: The big thing about CB is that the writers could do whatever the fuck they wanted re: the mechanics of their relationship because his demise was a foregone conclusion.                        Cynthia: Last question on the “love” section… The writers and Claire and Rupes have hit us over the head about how they “recognize each other” and are too similar. Mostly I roll my eyes at that because I see them as very different but I suspect you buy it. Do you have any reflections on that at this juncture vis a vis love, that is.                        Sara: I think they are similar in ways which might be detrimental to a relationship. And I suspect that’s what Rupert and Claire are usually getting at. The best example I can think of is their inability to effectively communicate with each other. They also have bad tempers.       Cynthia: That’s a wrap on the love question, I think! Anything else you think we should cover?                        Sara: If I turn out to be fantastically wrong about any of this, we need to use the gif “my client would be the first to tell you that hers is a minority view.” Because it is literally the truth.                        Cynthia: I don’t think so. Suddenly everyone seems more willing to discuss this stuff and Brody.                      Sara: The Brody stuff is becoming so much more fascinating to me. Shit, I didn’t expect that.                        Cynthia: Me neither!                        Sara: if they really are doing the thing about transforming CQ into CB i’m gonna have 8 strokes. " True text

But I know you have some strong opinions on that topic, so, let’s roll! To begin with, should Carrie and Quinn have sex this season?Sara (@carriemathison​):  Given that there are two episodes left in the season and a metric shit tonne of stuff they have left to address, I’m leaning toward no. It would distract from the larger picture at play here. As far as the overall season goes, Carrie and Quinn not having sex this season would not qualify as a failure. The writers not wrapping up their stories in a coherent way would.Laure: But… expectations are high. Why, do you think, people really want it to happen now?Sara: Because it’s been four years and the writers keep teasing something more between them that to this point has never come to fruition? Because “six” sounds like “sex”? I could go on…Laure: Ok. Let’s ease into more controversial topics… why do you think viewers want them to have sex… period?Sara: Sex between Carrie and Quinn—or, to clarify, the type of sex that people want between Carrie and Quinn (tender, loving, intimate, hot, smutty, etc.),–is validating to people’s investment. It’s not silly to watch a pairing for four years and want the people involved in that pairing to consummate their relationship at some point.Laure:  “Investment” is an interesting word. We invested… what? Time and emotions? We decided to care, and now, what, we want Homeland to pay up?Sara: Romantic sex typically cements desire and want on behalf of the characters, as well as investment in the pairing on behalf of the writers. But again… this is only true for the type of sex I suspect people would like to see between Carrie and Quinn. The same cannot be said for pity sex, friends-with-benefits sex, tragic sex, bad sex, etc.It’s gotta be “good.” Good for her, good for him.  And I’ve been kinda confused because it seems to me that Carrie and Quinn, in their current state, can’t have that type of sex right now. Not because love does not exist between them. Not because intimacy does not exist between them, nor tenderness, nor sexual attraction.Laure: Then… why?Sara: Because there is a lot of unresolved shit… Franny, Berlin, Missouri, The Letter… I feel like if they don’t address at least in some part all of this stuff it may lead to disaster later on. It may make the consummation of their relationship seem rushed (ironically, as it’s been four seasons).Laure: If it happened now, it would be bad sex.Sara: It would be misguided sex. And why would the fandom be so anticipatory about this event that could turn out to be a bad thing? Everyone should feel free to challenge me, by the way. I think my opinion is unpopular.Laure: But that’s what we want in this case. In fact, let’s go even more unpopular! Do you really think Carrie and Quinn’s relationship has to be romantic?Sara:  No, of course not. But I would be surprised if they didn’t at least explore that direction in a meaningful and committed way. But by no means does that need to work out permanently. In fact, I’m not convinced and never have been that Quinn and Carrie are endgame. It’s hard for me to imagine it… even if that would make Carrie psychologically and emotionally happy.Frangi (@frangipaniflower001​): So you think Carrie is meant to be alone? Or, rather with someone like Jonas… I mean, with someone with Jonas’ better qualities?Laure: Hey! Where do you come from?Frangi: The question is for Sara.Sara: Yes, maybe. Maybe Carrie is supposed to be alone, or with someone who is less intense and less similar. But really, the reason it’s hard for me to imagine Carrie in a happy relationship with Quinn is because I don’t think they will let her have that. I’m answering these questions not from what I, personally, want and desire for the character. But rather how I think the writers will approach the thing.Laure: Ok, then… What would you want and desire for the character at the end?Sara: I would like for her to be happy. But I’m not getting my hopes up.Frangi: As a show maker you should allow your character to—Sara: THE WRITERS DON’T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT CARRIE’S HAPPINESS!Frangi: I always thought the ending might be ambiguous. Like, Quinn’s been away for some time and then in 8.12 Carrie drives away from whatever, maybe Saul’s funeral, and we see him sitting in her car, or maybe just a silhouette.Sara: I’m not totally sold either on them making Carrie’s “ending” about where her relationship with Quinn is. Like, I’m not super into that.Laure: Would you prefer it if she was happy in a romantic way (with anyone) or would it be more interesting if she found happiness on her own?Sara: This feels like a SUPER hypothetical thought exercise, almost indulgent. I’m really not convinced AT ALL the writers give a shit about Carrie’s happiness. It’s hard for me to choose from those two options. I guess I’d go with romance but that calls to mind the obvious discord between my desire for her to find romance but desire for the end NOT to be about Quinn which I guess logically means I don’t want her to end up with Quinn? I’m torn.Laure: Even if Carrie is with Quinn at the end, they cannot make this fact center-stage. The ending will be about her mental health and professional choices. In a feminist show they cannot make Carrie’s fate be about a man.Sara: Agreed.Ashley (@ascloseasthis): IT IS NOT A FEMINIST SHOW.Laure: Aaaah! Will you people just stop popping up like this?Frangi: Hi, Ashley!Ashley: Hi! Carry on with your discussion. Sara: I was gonna say that Homeland being a feminist show remains an open question but that’s REALLY another debate for another time." True text

Jury’s out on whether her conversation with Saul and his ultimate reversal was earned or not but one thing is certain and that is that MIRA IS AMAZING MIRA IS QUEEN. We know she’s living her best life sans Saul Quinn’s GPS getting all political: “Turn left. Destination is on your right. You have arrived at your destination.” Shame America didn’t listen on 11/8/2016.Nice insight into Quinn’s backstory with with Nicki. In one conversation we revisited Johnny, understood that they had a past, and got insight into McClendon’s new group. And, as ever, Rupert trying to find the word for “touch” was simply heartbreaking and beautifully acted.Hat. Hats, actually. Oh, and Quinn had a shower. Somewhere, somehow. That’s always good.“Next time, ask for half up front.” Peter Quinn, educating America’s youth.“You can’t fall off the middle” is the code for Saul getting his diamonds? He seems to have fallen pretty damn hard… but it was nice, subtle character exposition.Elizabeth Keane’s verbal smackdown of one Mr. Dar Adal. These scenes have all been perfection. The hubris, the manipulation, the body movements.Who knew Carrie and Clarice would have so much to talk about… burner phones, Queens, Carrie being confused.Was anyone else verklempt by Saul’s voicemail to Carrie? Reminded us of “The Choice.” “Call me back, call me back, call me back.”The return of Carrie’s corkboard! We don’t know what the implications of that are, exactly, but we smiled with Saul when we saw it. It invoked memories of Carrie and Saul at their very best.The setting of the house across from the flag house was perfect, moody Homeland, all shadowy blues.BadWhy did they swap out the van instead of just, like… planting the bomb in the van? What was the point of that?I know Max meant well, but he’s been around covert ops how long? He could have been a little less obvious with the video. Because now he’s gonna get at least mildly tortured and our hearts are gonna get at least a little bit broken.Quinn’s wig, ahem. Was it worse than Carrie’s in season five? It’s like choosing your favorite poison.The number of times people got into locked rooms, buildings, or property without much difficulty: 4. Quinn at the flag house, Saul into Carrie’s brownstone, Saul into Carrie’s bulletin board room, Saul into Carrie’s computer (you have a kid, Carrie!)… apparently Max’s security provisions only went so far. So Carrie gets into a random car without asking who ordered it? Uber drivers of Brooklyn, take note!  Is it just us or does Rupes have a hard time pulling off the “working class American soldier” act? His cheekbones are too high, or something.Flashback: Gansa, can we just get clear that Claire and Rupes can’t pull off 30 years-old? Never again. Please. Pretty please?The casting of Pallis. He looks more like a bloody bodyguard than a solicitor general.Gansa, Americans don’t say “good day.” Even Dar.???Our resident Hebrew speaker (kind of) tells us Pesach is the word for Passover which, is kind of like naming a boy Christmas. Cue getting bullied on the playground.What’s with all these people just showing up and waiting outside Carrie’s house?Quinn clearly has Clarice’s phone number memorized. I guess most people don’t have their hookers on speed dial, but still.Just why was Quinn at the diner? Was it deliberate or did he get confused?So now Dar is inventing fevers for children. What next? Spreading Smallpox? Polio? Murdering Santa?Nicki’s odd look after Quinn leaves. Please don’t rat him out please don’t rat him out please don’t rat him out.Also: Please don’t let Carrie be manic please don’t let Carrie be manic please don’t let Carrie be manic.This was AG’s first solo writing credit since “The Drone Queen.” That’s apropos of nothing, but we just find it interesting.Do you think Keane tweets? She seems to have a lot of free time between meetings…" True text

It’s dirty, messy, noisy, and… ahem… Ok, seriously. Carrie and Quinn already have a complex, emotional, intense connection. Why is sex so important? Frangi (@frangipaniflower001): I believe they belong to each other.Laure: Ah. A romantic.Cynthia (@lange-c): Not to pressure you, Laure… but you’ve got a deadline on this debate. Carrie and Quinn could have sex tonight.Ashley (@ascloseasthis): Fucking whip cracker.Julie (@gabehcoud): Sleep well, Ashley?Frangi: As I was saying… I believe Carrie and Quinn belong to each other, not just as platonic soulmates but as partners. Adults who are in love and start a relationship should be allowed to have sex, right?Laure: Pff. No. Why? Sex. Yuck.Frangi [ignoring Laure]: But, also and here’s the real reason… Carrie and Quinn so often fail with words. With sex, they would finally be able to open up and communicate.Laure: But right now, they already have all the passion of a complex relationship. All the caring, all the antagonism…Cynthia: I think they’ll communicate. That is SO much more important.Julie: I think sex doesn’t make sense now. Carrie and Quinn have been split for a while. Times have changed, it’s not 4.12 anymore.Cynthia: It’s leading to something, though, Julie.Laure: I agree something is brewing. But come on. If Carrie and Quinn love each other “intensely,” they don’t need sex…Frangi: They don’t NEED sex. But if they wanna be more than the missed opportunity of a lifetime, it should happen… Even if they are messed up, raw and vulnerable, as soon as they manage to talk and address some of their feelings…Cynthia: Yeah but he’s kinda dirty. And his ex-lover’s blood is still on his lip, right? Ew. Quinn and his fucking shower issues.Ashley: I’m going for coffee.Julie: Does Cynthia always swear this much?All [in unison]: Yes.Julie: They need to get closer first. They are so… alienated from each other now. But they should have sex, of course!Laure: Would anybody be satisfied with a non sexual love story?Frangi: They are both approximately 40 years old, so too young to stay alone forever. Epic love, but forever chaste? No. Sydney (@snqa303): They have been through so much together these past six months… Frangi: And no one will ever be able to compete with the connection they have.Cynthia: I survived nine fucking years of Mulder and Scully. So..Laure: Why? They are both SO screwed up. Especially Quinn… Maybe sex would do nothing but complicate their relationship. [Dear Reader, I hope you understand that I’m playing devil’s advocate in this debate..]Sydney: Quinn will soon know that Carrie loves him. As long as he believes her and not Dar… it will be a good opportunity for sex. Hiding out together—very romantic… Laure: Don’t you think the writers want to milk the tension forever?Cynthia: They might. But HL has always presented sex as fairly realistic. Carrie and Quinn not fucking soon is unrealistic.Julie: They are afraid of doing it.Frangi: But it’s time.Sydney: I agree. It’s time. And it’s not just so I can see Rupes semi-naked.Laure: Oh sure.Sydney: That’s just a bonus.Cynthia: It’s NOT time. Not now. Not like this. Quinn’s a fucking mess.Frangi: Well… a hot mess.Sydney: Astrid’s death will change him.Frangi: There is too much mayhem around them… and we don’t know how long they will be hiding out together. If they get two or three boring days and nights in the safe house and are forced to talk…Laure: You sweet, optimistic, deluded souls.Frangi: Nobody’s listening to you, Laure.Cynthia: I still don’t think it’s right. Women want Rupert/Quinn in an irrational way. They just want him loved. And that’s honest–I get it–but not the story. Paralyzed sex just seems unlikely. Frangi: But Cynthia, he might never fully recover.Sydney: If Carrie tells him she loves him, I’ll be okay without sex.Frangi: No! Fuck canon! This is what I want: they save the day and Franny and whoever needs to be saved. And then they talk. And they have sex! So, if he’s paralyzed, let them have paralyzed sex…Sydney: Quinn still has one VERY large hand… just sayin’.Cynthia: Lol! EDITOR!Laure: Oh, I’m not editing any of this. This is the best part.Cynthia: Christ…Laure: Sydney is totally right by the way. With a little creativity…Sydney: Exactly.Laure: If Quinn can insert a key and open a lock with only one hand then he can perfectly… Cynthia: Oh my God.Sydney: Exactly! It was foreshadowing! Cynthia: Where the fuck is Sara to make us grow up? [Sara was napping, even though this topic was her idea.]Frangi: Sex between them in Quinn’s state would show that Carrie really means it. Julie: That would be real love.Cynthia: That’s the definition of pity sex.Sydney: As long as her vagina doesn’t kill him.Cynthia: Sigh. Jonas is living. That theory doesn’t work anymore.Frangi: But sure, I’d choose an “I love you” over sex…Sydney: Same here…Frangi: We were told not so subtly that he’s not having ED, by the way.Cynthia: That matters!Sydney: I just need some hope at the end of this season to get me through until season 7…Cynthia: Wait. Back to the ED topic… So… why did they do the whore scene?Frangi: There was also a little of “You want a sexy Quinn? Here! How do you like that?” from Gansa…Cynthia: Or, it could have been a tell for tonight. They kept Quinn sexually viable right away…Frangi: Maybe! To show us how deep Quinn had sunk… AND that he is still functioning. Two meanings. One obvious, one foreshadowing. Sydney: I don’t think the whore scene was necessary to show that he can get it up. If Carrie and Quinn have sex, we will know he can. Quinn also made a pass at Carrie, so he was obviously turned on… poor guy, nightmare plus a morning hard on, then rejection…Frangi: Quinn won’t make another moveSydney: It has to come from her.Frangi: What will make Carrie open up? Cynthia: The letter.Julie: The letter.Frangi: Yes. Gansa said the letter will be addressed. Laure: True. But he also said that the season would be sexy. People, Gansa is a liar. Ok, I have enough material! Thank you! Zeffy (@zeffy001): WAIT! I WAIT! I want in! I know I’m late!Laure: Fine. I can pencil you in. I’m very generous.Zeffy: Logically, it’s not the best moment but there’s never a good moment. Shit hits the fan every fucking time! But they can slow down the pace too, and give them one, if they want… Because sex is a way for Carrie and Quinn to connect that definitely might work better than words.Frangi: That would make a lovely conclusion!Laure: Nope.Frangi: Yes it would… “Sex is a way for Carrie and Quinn to connect that definitely might work better than words.” It’s lovely!Laure: I have better.Frangi: Really?Laure: This is about sex, Frangi. Not love or connection. So… Sydney’s line. Let’s copy and paste it.Sydney: Quinn has a very large hand.Laure: That’s the relevant info." True text
