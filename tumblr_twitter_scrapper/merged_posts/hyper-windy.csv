Not all scenes will match perfectly when the all scenes have been shot. Some scenes will need to be reshoot. THIS IS TRUE OF ALL MOVIES.Reshooting has been scheduled since the beginning. Originally it was scheduled in spring, but it was bumped into summer because (1) the director and writers need some time to analyze and tweak the scenes to perfection, and (2) the stars have been involved in other projects since original shooting and the RO production team needs to schedule around their activities.Only “intimate” – that is, character-to-character scenes – are being reshot. Battle scenes are not.THERE HAD BEEN NO TEST SCREENING. Whoever told you that was lying through the teeth.THERE HAD BEEN FREEDOM FROM DISNEY. Lucasfilm and the RO Team had been given total freedom, without corporate meddling.Only two guys from Disney ever watched the whole collection of shots (note: collection of shots. Not screening): Bob Iger and Alan Horn. And they did NOT interfere. (They’re just being super-privileged fans, that’s all) ((I’m so envious)).THE RESHOOT INVOLVES ONLY A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE WHOLE MOVIE. Reshooting 40% of the movie – as some rumormongers had been falsely perpetuating – will send Lucasfilm/Disney into Panic Mode and pushes back Release Date. As of now, there is NO plan to push back the Release Date. BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS GOING ACCORDING TO PLAN.FIVE MONTHS before Release Date is ENOUGH TIME. Especially with the help of today’s highly sophisticated editing machines. Just a comparison: A New Hope underwent a reshoot for a key scene with less than 5 months before release date.So, please hold your horses, calm your nerves, and be assured that Rogue One is being produced according to plans.And shaping up to be one of the greatest movies of the Star Wars Universe."
