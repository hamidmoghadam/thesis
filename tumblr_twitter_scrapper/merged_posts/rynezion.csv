But where do you start when setting ground rules for how and when magic can be used?  My goal in this post is to give you some ideas while you map out your world of magic. Who can learn magic? Is magic a thing that all people can learn, or certain people who have a knack for it?  Is magic something that can be learned at all?  Perhaps it’s only readily available for those who are born with it, such as the wizards in Harry Potter.  Or magic is contained in things, such as charms, amulets, or unicorn horns.  People may have to learn how to access the magic contained in these items, but they are solely reliant on items in order to use magic.  Perhaps magic can only be learned by certain races. How is magic learned?  In Harry Potter, wizards go to school for seven years to learn how to use magic.  Other books wizards have apprentices they train.    Can magic be self-taught?  How does a person access magic?  Through emotion, thoughts, something else?  Perhaps learning magic requires a large sacrifice. Does the magic need to be channeled?  Once again, using the example of Harry Potter, wizards need wands in order to use magic.  Other common themes involve wizards using staffs in order to use magic.  But there are stories where wizards don’t need an item to channel the magic, such as the wizards in the anime/manga series Fairy Tail.  Perhaps magic does need an item to be channeled through, but it doesn’t have to be the traditional wand or staff. How often can a person use magic? Does magic use up a person’s energy, and therefore a person’s magic is limited to how much energy they have?  Perhaps they have a different “energy”, such as mana, that restricts how much magic they can use?  Maybe you want to go the Once Upon a Time route and magic isn’t used in excess because it comes with a price.  Perhaps how magic is used is why people don’t use it so often.  Maybe magic is used very often. Does magic need incantations?  Harry Potter uses incantations, whether is it is verbal or non-verbal.  There does not seem to be an incantations in the magic that the Witch uses in the Chronicles of Narnia.  Incantations are used quite often in the Septimus Heap series.  And there no incantations in Lord of the Rings.  Or maybe incantations are reserved for the more powerful, older spells.  Perhaps incantations make a spell more stable.   Can magic be invoked by using items?  Potions is one of the common ways this is used.  But sometimes certain spells can only be invoked by using ingredients, like in the show Charmed or the movie Practical Magic.  Perhaps it’s only used occasionally, such as some spells performed in the show Sabrina the Teenage Witch.  Maybe items are used in only certain branches, such as Divination in Harry Potter. What cannot be done by magic?  With the Genie’s magic in Disney’s Aladdin, he could not make someone come back from the dead, fall in love, or grant more wishes.  Food cannot be created out of thin air according to the rules of magic in Harry Potter.  Actual love in Harry Potter can’t be created, but enchantments that cause the victim to have an obsessive type of love does exist.  Perhaps the dead can be raised, as evidenced by stories with necromancy, but it can’t actually bring back the person completely.  Something’s missing.  Perhaps only skeletons can be brought back, or the person comes back in a zombie like state.  Perhaps you would go so far as to say that magic cannot create permanent things out of nothing. Does magic have categories/a way it is organized? Potions, Divination, Transifiguration, Charms, etc.  Or light, dark, chaos, order,  water, fire, etc.  Or human magic, dragon magic, unicorn magic, elf magic, etc.  And it doesn’t have to have only one way of organization.  It can have several levels, just like when science organizes living organisms.    So these are few things to consider when creating magic.  The nature of your magic may not necessarily fit into all of these questions, and that’s fine.  But don’t be afraid to have long explanations for your magic.  You probably won’t fit it all in your story - in fact, you’ll want to be careful how you incorporate magic rules as you don’t want to infodump on your readers - but having the rules there will help you create your story and give you some answers to the why questions that might come up, such as, “why don’t they just magic themselves out?” " False text

(Not for eating. Usually. But they love children, and sometimes their ideas of ownership are, uh, not the same as ours. Bells in nurseries are not unwise.) Ghouls have beautiful eyes that shine like gems in the darkness. You are not their food, but if they think you’re taking their food, keep in mind that they dwell in packs. Hope you run faster than they do, and that the cemetery you invaded has iron or steel fencing. Sometimes, however, some *extremely* fast apologizing means you won’t have to run. Much. The older the cemetery, the more likely it is to feel like an extremely peaceful place. This is not by chance. If the old cemetery feels like it’s staring at you even in broad daylight, find another place to hang. Ghouls protect what is theirs. If there is no protection in place, things far more worriesome move in, and they are probably hungry. I don’t care if you think you’re just dealing with a ghost. Giving unknown entities permission to use your body or energy is A STUPID FUCKING IDEA. Don’t do it. Hearing someone call your name when no one is there is not a bad thing, even if you answer. Hearing someone call your name and then tell you to do things? That is where the bad part comes in. Say no and tell the thing to fuck off. It’s your living space; you have the authority to do so and they don’t. Waking up to the sensation of something holding you down is annoying; it’s only a fear tactic. Roll your eyes and go back to sleep. Stupid shit will be gone when you wake up again. If your dreams are repeating themselves, either exactly the same or by the exact same subject matter, someone is trying to tell you something, or they are trying to teach you something. Pay attention. This also applies to nightmares. There is more than one way to learn an important lesson. Symbols only work if you’re using them on yourself. To use them against another, especially another of a differing faith/religion, is a grave insult.  (I did not intend that pun and I refuse to take it back.) If you walk through any place that feels peaceful and suddenly realize that you now hold something in your hand, stop and investigate it. Usually it’s something explainable, but ask: “Is this meant to be mine?” If it disappears, you’ve gotten an answer. If it does not? Take it home and keep it safe. Yes, the crows really are making fun of you. They get bored easily. Yes, your cat really is watching something that you can’t see. Unless they’re freaked out, it’s fine. If the cat is freaked out, light a candle against the darkness. That saying exists for a reason. A flashlight or a lightbulb is not a candle. An electrical current is a form of fire, but you want fire that is breathing the air, not trapped behind glass. Do not be rude or afraid of something just because it doesn’t fit your ideals of pretty. Unless it’s trying to hurt you, chances are it’s just another person trying to go about their business until you started screeching at it. If you scare the shit out of someone and they run away, apologize, even if all you were doing was sitting there minding your own business. Sometimes they don’t expect us any more than we expect them. Research your family tree on all possible sides as far back as you can. Sometimes it is very important to know where your blood came from. Sometimes learning where your blood came from makes you start to headtilt because Whut and HOW and WTF WAS WRONG WITH ALL OF YOU, WHY.  (Why did lineal descendents of Charlemagne (one line from each kid) all decide to get on a boat in the 1600s, cross the ocean, go straight to a random valley in Kentucky, and stay there? Fucking weirdos.) Oh, and: MANNERS, MANNERS, MANNERS.  The fact that you can write this while not feeling 100% astounds and inspires me to no end. " False text

A shift of your eyebrow in skepticism, or the way your lip may twitch to a half smile cause you’re trying not to laugh. These behaviors are vital for writing in character, because not only do the allow you to visually see what is happening but it is also reaffirming whatever emotion your character is showing. So why should you write it?  Much of human communication is non-verbal which means you need to also translate this non-verbal reaction in a post. It allows you to greatly enhance the emotions of another character and always another person to ‘visually’ see how they feel in a post. Most of all, this will add depth and volume to your post to make it feel more real. IT will make your character feel like a human instead of just another fictional person you look at from above. Below you will find a list different type of emotions and what sort of body language can be exhibited to them.  Three ways to accent an action. When writing about emotions, there are different ways to verbally write them out. Each one is unique in their own way, allowing you to show more about the emotion. Emphasize the Emotion.But doing this, you are expressing both the emotion and the body language. We’ll use a simple example. It’s short and simple yet you can sense he is happy.John felt so happy that he was humming a tune while walking down the hall. Complicate the Emotion.Sometimes, even when you are feeling one emotion, deep down rooted underneath the facade of it all, there is actually an underlining emotion they feel. This is something you have to truly express otherwise no one will know.John felt so happy that he was humming a tune while walking down the hall. However, it was obvious by the way his nose crinkled that he was disgusted by the actions beforehand. Instead, John covered it up by appearing pleased today. Contradict the Emotion.This is a little different than complicate. Contradicting means that you are claiming one thing when in fact its the other. In many ways, this has a variety of uses, from inner depth of the truth to what you see in person, or someone creating a wall. It could be considered a lie, but when is anything that easy?John felt so happy that he was humming a tune while walking down the hall. In truth, once he was in the classroom, his shoulders slumped and a pout crossed his lips when no one was around, showing just how displeased he was with the situation.  Remember that you do not always have to contradict or complicate anything. Sometimes all you need to do is emphasize and that will be just fine. You don’t always have to have an underlining complicated for an emotion to make it more enhanced. Do be afraid to use the Thesaurus to also improve an emotion. Such things as “happy” is a nice emotional word, but think of how much more powerful it is when you heard some is “overjoyed” or “content.” She how these emotions matched up with a body language can give two different styles of happiness? Mix and match to find what works best for your character at the time.  More In Depth Information  What I’ve stated above is more of a simplistic overview. IF you truly want to improve yourself, go to this LINK HERE To see just how much body language can reveal about a person. You will find things such as how a person lies, how the eyes reaction, the positioning of a person in personal space, mouth, and head body language and so much more. Use these resources to greatly increase the reactions of your character to another and create a more life-like world.  " False text

Well Persephone only ate 6 seeds so she only stayed 6 months, so maybe if you spat out most of it you’d just be condemned to the occasional day “BRB got go pay the two day toll for fellating a fairy.”  “you wanna come over for the weekend?” “oh man im so sorry i sucked some fairy dick once and now i have to keep coming back to do it again– its a long story” “you what now”  i can hardly believe this isn’t already the plot of an Oglaf comic  now that u said it im really surprised as well  what the fuck did i just read  Why ISN’T this an Oglaf comic yet?  I’m so happy that i’m not the only person who thinks of questions like these. I love you all so much.  I’m not convinced by this, actually! Like, this analysis treats it as a substance problem, i.e. “edible matter from fairyland has properties that, if ingested, physically prevent you from being able to return to the real world.” But OTOH, a recurring theme throughout fairy stories is that they’re all about…rules and exchanges and agreements with really steep interest rates: “I’ll do you this favor, but if you don’t guess my name you’ll have to give me your first-born child.” “You’re gonna be real good at everything but when you’re 16 you’re gonna prick your finger and die.” “You loaned me $2 for the bus when I looked like a beggar, so now here’s a literal pile of gold and shit.” Not to mention that in Childe Rowland, one of the central “if you eat food from fairyland you’re stuck there” stories, Rowland manages to retrieve his siblings despite them all presumably having chowed down on fairy food – all it took was beating the Fairy King in a swordfight and threatening to chop his head off. The takeaway, I think, is that the food thing a matter of implicit exchange: if you get your grub on in fairyland, you’re accepting their hospitality and eating food that they own. This means you owe them, which the fairies can magically leverage to prevent you from leaving. (You can probably get around this by explicitly agreeing to pay for your meal before you sit down to eat. From what I remember, fairies don’t seem capable of pulling a “Haha, we had an agreement but you’re fucked anyways!” maneuver, so if they agree to let you leave they might even be forced to help you leave.) Which brings us to the matter at hand: if you blow a fairy you’re doing them a favor! They owe you. And…they’re a fairy, so if you didn’t agree to terms beforehand they might not repay you in a way that’s ultimately helpful or safe, but it certainly doesn’t seem like they’d be able to, like, pat you on the head and be like “Thanks, you’re really good at this buuuuuuut also you’re stuck here forever now.” Instead, what seems more likely is…I dunno, showing up to your wedding years later and giving you a beautiful white horse that always comes when called, while loudly praising you as truly deserving it for giving them them simply the best oral they’ve had in years.   Or they feel obligated to show up at your house a couple days a year. So, like “you wanna come over for the weekend?” “oh man I’m so sorry i sucked some fairy dick once and now he always comes by over memorial day weekend and helps me out with minor home repairs.” “you what now”  This is my favorite act of intellectual bugfuckery on this entire website, when I die I want someone to print this out and place it in my grave with me so I can cherish it forever.  i love this goddamn site " False text

(It’s not even a town really, Kei thinks, with the market, the smithy, several small shrines and his tiny shop, the inn just around the corner. A village. Cobblestone streets and wooden framed windows. Chicken feathers everywhere.)He wades through the neatly stacked rows of books, to the left, where he keeps his maps, journals and his desk. Fine dust is dancing in the low sunlight – Kei squints and supposes it has been over a week since he properly scrubbed the place. Might as well do it today. It’s not like the library is full of people in harvest season.It’s fitting how Hitoka choses this exact moment to barge through the door, escorted by the sound of chimes clinking cheerfully (he’s ought to get rid of relics his brother left here now, really), scrambling to find her footing after bumping into a stack of old books about home remedies and recipes.Read the rest on AO3" True link

There have been a lot of fantasies—but none of them included finally getting Motorcycle Guy back to his place only to have him babble “I don’t normally do this” over and over. Excerpt: “I don’t normally do this.” They were the first words out of Asahi’s mouth after the door of Yuu’s bedroom shut behind them, halting Yuu in his tracks. Until a few hours ago, he’d only known Asahi as ‘the soft wild guy’, the frequent object of Yuu’s admiration and of his late night thirst texts to Ryuu. Yuu didn’t often go for guys—for some reason the guys who were into him tended to be creeps—but Asahi had been a mirage in the desert, utterly desirable but always just a little outside of Yuu’s reach. Tonight that had changed. “Okay,” Yuu said after a moment, wondering what you were supposed to say when someone assured you they didn’t normally do something. Put them at ease? Should he tell Asahi that he’d count the night a win on the mere fact that they’d kissed and ground up against each other at the party already, that the rest of the night was just icing on the cake? He wasn’t sure, and it was easier to press Asahi into the door, his hands curled in Asahi’s leather jacket, his face tilted up. Asahi stooped slightly to accommodate him, his chin tucking, his big hands coming up to cradle Yuu’s face as their mouths met. Yuu had been right to lust after Asahi for so long. Asahi was a face-cradler, who kissed back like the kiss actually meant something. Being that huge and that tender had to be illegal, and yet, here Asahi was, holding someone he’d only just met with utter sincerity. It was fantastic, until— ((read the rest on AO3)) " False link
