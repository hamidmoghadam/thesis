Every one of the past 40 years has been warmer than the 20th century average. 2014 was the hottest year on record…until 2015…then 2016.    In fact, the period from 2014-2016 marks the first time that the hottest year on record occurred three times in a row. Not a coincidence.    This chart from NOAA shows atmospheric CO2 levels over the past 400,000 years. How does President Donald Trump explain this?    This chart shows global sea ice levels since 1978. On Jan 14, the total sea ice extent was at lowest level since satellite records began.    A social media ban will not reverse the massive changes happening to our planet. Science is science. Let’s wake up and take action.  " True text

Many of you expressed support for that decision, others less so. Either way, you deserve an explanation.My absence is a statement — to the President-elect, to the country, but most of all to you — that Donald Trump’s victory does not vindicate his past. Throughout his professional life, during the campaign, and now in his transition, Donald Trump’s words and actions are inconsistent with fundamental American values and beneath the grand office he will assume. They threaten the democratic cultural norms that are essential to our republic.His electoral legitimacy is not in question. Tomorrow Donald Trump will be sworn in as our 45th president in a peaceful transition of power. His moral and ethical legitimacy are another story.The next President of the United States cannot effectively lead this country with only a legal and technical victory in the Electoral College. He needs moral and ethical assets as well. These are not purchased through the art of the deal, but earned through words and deeds that subordinate personal gain for the advancement of freedom and equality.His attack on civil rights icon John Lewis, which came on the weekend dedicated to Martin Luther King Jr., reflects a dangerous pattern of behavior. Mr. Trump is within his rights to dispute Congressman Lewis’s assertion of electoral illegitimacy, but as President-elect and as President he has the obligation to show basic respect towards dissenters. By resorting to vengeful ridicule — “all talk, no action” — Mr. Trump demonstrated no appreciation for a man who possesses moral and ethical capital in spades, capital earned through his brave words and deeds. Donald Trump’s conduct raised more doubts about his moral legitimacy to lead a diverse nation.While campaigning for the presidency, he defined large communities of people through a single, prejudiced frame: Muslims as terrorists, Latinos as rapists and drug lords, African-Americans as poor and living in urban ghettos, women as weak. This past weekend, he laid to rest any hope that he would leave such divisive rhetoric on the campaign trail.As the descendent of parents and grandparents who were imprisoned in Japanese-American internment camps, I know the pain of being unjustly labeled as not deserving respect or equal protection under the law. Could Executive Order 9066 happen again in America? I hope not, but I’m in no mood to stand and applaud when the risk is so evident. And I certainly won’t celebrate a man who empowers and employs people who preach hate.America is at her best when she leads by example, when she exemplifies fairness, and when she exhibits a moral authority earned through upholding the principles of freedom and equality.Donald Trump’s ethical shortcomings are equally disturbing. He will be sworn in to office despite serious questions about his business ties, his conflicts of interest, and the influence of a malevolent foreign leader on his Administration. These are not typical partisan objections. Every American should be concerned by Donald Trump’s unprecedented lack of transparency, exemplified by his refusal to produce tax documents that would reveal the size and location of his investments and debts.When President Trump takes military action in a foreign country, we will not know if it’s in America’s best interest or his own. This fact alone is enough to justify staying home from the inaugural events. The Presidential Inauguration is traditionally a time for the two parties to come together and affirm another milestone in our democracy.But given my moral and ethical concerns with the incoming Administration, I cannot pretend this transition is normal. I cannot gloss over or whitewash conduct that is unbecoming for a president by going through the motions of ceremony. I owe you more than my vote; I owe you my conscience and my well considered judgment.As your representative, I took an oath to uphold and protect the Constitution. I will do so by abstaining from the pageantry of the inauguration and preparing to do everything I can to ensure our community and our country lives up to its magnificent promise.———–Medium piece here: https://medium.com/@repmarktakano/why-im-not-attending-the-inauguration-an-open-letter-to-my-constituents-ec6c6c848737#.176e7986l" True text

My office put together the following report to highlight the impact of poverty in our community and to offer solutions that will help thousands of our neighbors, friends and family lift themselves out of poverty.  The report found:More than 392,000 people in Riverside County live in poverty, including 142,844 children.In Riverside County, Section 8 housing assistance only has funding for 8,500 families, while 20,000 families are on the waiting list.A single parent of two is likely to find themselves $589 short of their expenses every month.No one working full time should be living in poverty. I want to help working families achieve economic stability through:Raising the minimum wage to $15/hour.Expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit to allow low-income families to keep more of what they earn.Fully funding the Section 8 housing program, which gives children the stability they need to get a good education.

At best, his comments are revisionist history, wrapped in a logical fallacy. President Obama’s executive action prioritizes the protection of vulnerable, hardworking immigrants. Executive Order 9066 did the opposite and was not just a failure of the executive, but a failure of each branch of government, as Congress allowed the internment of thousands to take place, and the Supreme Court failed to uphold the constitutional rights of those interned. While I’m sure that Senator Paul’s purpose of making these comments was to feed the libertarian fantasy of rampant government overreach in everything President Obama does, the fact remains that there is absolutely no comparison to his executive action, which allows millions of hardworking immigrants to no longer live in fear, and the systematic stripping of basic human rights of Japanese Americans by every branch of government."

As the new school year approaches, we are obviously in denial teachers are mentally figuring out what materials we need for the school year, what will be provided by the school or families, and what we will buy with our own money as we shop sales (if it is in our budget).  Several members of our #education community on tumblr dealt with unexpected family deaths, weather disasters, or more happy (but expensive) life achievements like getting married or having a baby.  Our pockets have been hit hard, and I think you’d be surprised how much of our own money we spend on classrooms each year. Many of us teach in areas where our students’ families cannot help with school supplies.  In fact, as I began working on this project, every teacher I contacted to include that came from a more affluent community declined being included so that classrooms in greater need could be helped.  I am in awe of the teachers in this community.  After the jump is a list of teachers and their classroom wish lists for the upcoming year.  If you are able to, please consider supporting a teacher via their wishlist.  If you’d rather make a donation to their supply fund or send a gift card, I’m sure you could contact them and they wouldn’t turn you down.    So after the jump are the blogs and corresponding wishlists from Tumblr’s teachers — most of the educators on this list I have personally interacted with and know them to be dedicated to their students.

Jeb Bush was right about one thing – our kids deserve effective teachers, and they aren’t always getting them [“Students assert right to effective teachers,” Opinion, Feb. 22]. However, rather than contemplate recruitment and retention strategies he joins a new group of conservative education partisans looking to undermine workers unions by pitting teachers against students in the public debate. Bush is also right that there are “relatively few ineffective [teachers]” that should be removed from the classroom. But it is naïve to believe that stripping away teachers’ workforce protections is a panacea. The stories used by advocates for Bush’s position are largely anecdotal and are supported by neither the academic data nor those who work in the classroom. Prior to being elected to Congress, I worked for 23 years as a teacher in the Rialto Unified School District where I taught predominantly low-income Latino and African American students. Even now, I am maintaining my teaching credentials and will always make teaching – in one way or another – part of what I do. Teachers are overworked and underpaid; the line is a bit cliché, but it is still true. For those of us who teach, it is more than a job; it’s a calling, a career and a life-long commitment. It is the classroom teacher who is on the front-line, working to address the deep and complex issues our schools and student are facing. We do it because we want to give back to our communities and see future generations succeed. But even our best teachers sometimes come up short, often because we aren’t providing the tools and training they need to get better. However, instead of moving to support educators, Gov. Bush and his allies advocate for a punitive response. It’s just not true that teachers and their workforce protections are to blame for increased turnover and lower educational quality in our poorest schools. Rather, this is a systemwide teacher placement issue. Our schools, regardless of location, socioeconomic makeup, or other demographic, should strive for a balance of new teachers and veteran teachers, and it is up to administrators to make sure that is achieved. As a former community college trustee, I have also viewed teacher protections from an administrative perspective. While my experience was in higher education, California’s K-12 disciplinary and tenure regulations are not all that different from those governing community colleges. I was involved in decisions to discipline tenured professors and to uphold recommendations to not grant tenure. I know that there are mechanisms we can incorporate into the system without abandoning workforce protections. Certainly, the issues brought forth by the Vergara v. the State of California trial regarding teacher tenure, the dismissal process, and the so-called “last-in, first-out” policy are worthy of examination. In fact, I believe it is critical to ensure that tenure is meaningful, not just a formality. If the current 18-month decision period to either grant or deny teacher tenure is ineffective, then we should change it. That does not mean throwing out tenure altogether. It is just one of many powerful tools used to recruit and retain teachers who may otherwise take their talents elsewhere. And it isn’t just about job security. It’s also about working conditions like class size, wraparound services, and general workplace morale that drive teacher recruitment and retention. Critics of teacher protections such as tenure need to realize what I discovered when I first entered the teaching profession – that great teachers develop over time with practice, hard work and support from administrators. That is why we need to invest in more complete teacher development and support systems that allow educators to grow and succeed. Research shows that the more experience teachers have, the more effective they are in the classroom. A system that does not allow for development and growth, but attempts to motivate with threatening ones job is setting itself up for failure. In a profession where the stakes are so high, these benefits are critical to ensuring a robust and effective teacher base. We must not do away with them. Rep. Mark Takano, D-Riverside, represents California’s 41st Congressional District." True text

In preparation I sent this “Dear Colleague” to other Members of Congress suggesting a few questions they could ask. —- 9 Questions to Ask in your APSCU/For-Profit College Meeting Are you meeting with the Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities or a for-profit college this week? Here are 9 important questions you should ask to make sure you are getting you the whole story: 1. 32 state attorney generals, the CFPB, SEC, FDIC, and DOJ are all investigating the practices of for-profit colleges. Is your company one of them? How should “bad actors” be dealt with? 2. What percentage of your income comes from all types of Federal aid (including military and veterans education benefits)? Don’t you think that warrants some regulation? 3. What percentage of your budget do you spend on marketing and recruiting vs. academic instruction? What percentage goes to profit? 4. What percentage of your students default on their federal loans? 5. How many of your professional programs lack programmatic accreditation? May I have a list of all your professional programs and their accreditations? 6. What is your job placement rate and how do you define placement? Do you count short-term placements? 7. Do you have formal rules against recruiters contacting a prospect more than 3 times or engaging in “pain-based” recruiting and emotional manipulation? 8. Is there any threshold you think appropriate to cut off federal funding for the worst performing career education programs?  9. Do you expect any of your school’s programs to fail the metrics in the Department’s last public gainful employment proposal? Which programs and why?

I’m happy that House Republicans are talking about Immigration again, but creating a permanent second class of citizens is unacceptable. What’s your opinion? PREAMBLE Our nation’s immigration system is broken and our laws are not being enforced. Washington’s failure to fix them is hurting our economy and jeopardizing our national security. The overriding purpose of our immigration system is to promote and further America’s national interests and that is not the case today. The serious problems in our immigration system must be solved, and we are committed to working in a bipartisan manner to solve them. But they cannot be solved with a single, massive piece of legislation that few have read and even fewer understand, and therefore, we will not go to a conference with the Senate’s immigration bill. The problems in our immigration system must be solved through a step-by-step, common-sense approach that starts with securing our country’s borders, enforcing our laws, and implementing robust enforcement measures. These are the principals guiding us in that effort. Border Security and Interior Enforcement Must Come First It is the fundamental duty of any government to secure its borders, and the United States is failing in this mission. We must secure our borders now and verify that they are secure. In addition, we must ensure now that when immigration reform is enacted, there will be a zero tolerance policy for those who cross the border illegally or overstay their visas in the future. Faced with a consistent pattern of administrations of both parties only selectively enforcing our nation’s immigration laws, we must enact reform that ensures that a President cannot unilaterally stop immigration enforcement. Implement Entry-Exit Visa Tracking System A fully functioning Entry-Exit system has been mandated by eight separate statutes over the last 17 years. At least three of these laws call for this system to be biometric, using technology to verify identity and prevent fraud. We must implement this system so we can identify and track down visitors who abuse our laws. Employment Verification and Workplace Enforcement In the 21st century it is unacceptable that the majority of employees have their work eligibility verified through a paper based system wrought with fraud. It is past time for this country to fully implement a workable electronic employment verification system. Reforms to the Legal Immigration System For far too long, the United States has emphasized extended family members and pure luck over employment-based immigration. This is inconsistent with nearly every other developed country. Every year thousands of foreign nationals pursue degrees at America’s colleges and universities, particularly in high skilled fields. Many of them want to use their expertise in U.S. industries that will spur economic growth and create jobs for Americans. When visas aren’t available, we end up exporting this labor and ingenuity to other countries. Visa and green card allocations need to reflect the needs of employers and the desire for these exceptional individuals to help grow our economy. The goal of any temporary worker program should be to address the economic needs of the country and to strengthen our national security by allowing for realistic, enforceable, usable, legal paths for entry into the United States. Of particular concern are the needs of the agricultural industry, among others. It is imperative that these temporary workers are able to meet the economic needs of the country and do not displace or disadvantage American workers. Youth One of the great founding principles of our country was that children would not be punished for the mistakes of their parents. It is time to provide an opportunity for legal residence and citizenship for those who were brought to this country as children through no fault of their own, those who know no other place as home. For those who meet certain eligibility standards, and serve honorably in our military or attain a college degree, we will do just that. Individuals Living Outside the Rule of Law Our national and economic security depend on requiring people who are living and working here illegally to come forward and get right with the law. There will be no special path to citizenship for individuals who broke our nation’s immigration laws – that would be unfair to those immigrants who have played by the rules and harmful to promoting the rule of law. Rather, these persons could live legally and without fear in the U.S., but only if they were willing to admit their culpability, pass rigorous background checks, pay significant fines and back taxes, develop proficiency in English and American civics, and be able to support themselves and their families (without access to public benefits). Criminal aliens, gang members, and sex offenders and those who do not meet the above requirements will not be eligible for this program. Finally, none of this can happen before specific enforcement triggers have been implemented to fulfill our promise to the American people that from here on, our immigration laws will indeed be enforced.

If Congress doesn’t act by July 1st, the interest rate on Stafford Loans will double from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent. Instead of addressing this impending increase that hurts American students, the Republican plan actually makes it worse. In just five years, under the Republican plan, loan rates will rise 7.7 percent. More than 38 million Americans have outstanding loan debt, totaling almost $1 trillion dollars.  The Democratic plan keeps Stafford loan interest rates at 3.4% to ensure that cost is not a barrier to accessing higher education."
