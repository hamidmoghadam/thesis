aarontveitdaily 159300660213 "2017-04-07 13:24:14 GMT" http://aarontveitdaily.tumblr.com/post/159300660213/a-true-broadway-baby-aaron-tveit "tveitnetwork: Aaron Tveit is a man who can do it all. Not only has he toured the country with numerous shows including “Rent” and “Hairspray,” but he has originated the role of Gabe in Broadway’s “Next to Normal,” sang and danced his heart out as Danny Zuko in Fox’s “Grease: Live”, and portrayed several characters on television such as “Gossip Girl's” Tripp van der Bilt and “Graceland's” Mike Warren. Yes, Tveit was born a star, and he is coming to the Parker Playhouse in Fort Lauderdale on April 29 for a one night only concert. Prepare to see just how much he can dazzle an audience. First off, what can we expect from your performance at the Parker Playhouse? It’s essentially an evening of Broadway songs. I’ve been doing some concerts lately, and this is a show that I first did at a place called Wolf Trap outside of DC. So it is a relatively new one for me. Some of the songs will be from shows that I’ve been in, some songs are favorites of mine, and some songs you may not necessarily expect me to sing. So it is kind of an evening of Broadway songs, a lot of which audiences will definitely recognize. Songs we would not expect you to sing? Any examples? Well, I don’t want to give anything away, but the best example was when I did my first set of concerts a few years ago in New York. I had the idea to sing a Taylor Swift song. I try to have fun with these concerts and not take myself too seriously, and my hope is the audience will feel the same way. So my music director and I went back and forth and we thought this could be the worst idea ever, or it could be a great idea. I ended up singing “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,” and it ended up being of the most fun moments of the evening. The audience even participated. So from that experience, with all the shows I put together, I always look for a way to include the audience and have them be a little surprised by some of my song choices just for the goal of everyone having a good time. So that is kind of an example I can give without giving anything away. I’m assuming this is not your first time in Fort Lauderdale. I have spent a lot of time in Fort Lauderdale. One of the TV shows I was on, “Graceland,” was shot in Florida so I was there for the better part of three years. I actually drove by the Parker Playhouse daily. What would you say is your favorite part about performing? The thing that I miss the most about being on stage since I’ve been doing a lot of TV and film primary for the last 5-6 years is the interaction with the audience. That’s what these concerts, kind of along the lines I was saying before about the songs that I look for, they really allow me to break that fourth wall and directly interact with the audience. I like to speak to them. That is definitely the most rewarding to me. Having that back and forth with the audience. Being a vocalist, Broadway star and a TV and film actor, you are pretty much a triple threat! Do you prefer one more than the others? [Laughs] You know, I’ve gotten to the point where I now love working on set and being on camera as much as I love singing. They kind of come hand in hand now. I’ve worked and fell in love with the craft of being on camera, but that being said, there is absolutely nothing like being on stage and having the energy of the audience. Having that back and forth. You know, when you’re shooting something on set, everyone has to be quiet, nobody can laugh – you get no feedback. I mean, you might watching something a year later and say, “Oh yeah, I kind of remember when we shot that,” but it’s very different. There is nothing like the energy of being on stage. Do you have a dream role? That’s a hard one for me because I’ve been so blessed and lucky. Ever since I left school, I’ve gotten to do so many different things in all these different avenues and I have thoroughly enjoyed every single second of it. So I think going forward, I don’t know if I can put a finger on what the dream role would be, but I obviously just want the opportunities to continue. That’s my dream to be able to keep this going for the rest of my career and get the same kind of fulfillment out of it. “Rent” kick started your career, correct? Yes. Do you plan on seeing the 20th anniversary tour? I had a little bit of interaction with the people who were putting that tour together right before they were going out. One of my company managers was working on the production side of things, so I was aware of it, but I don’t have any plans now. If they are close to anywhere that I’m at, I’ll definitely check it out. The problem with those tours is that they don’t play New York, but I’ll check it out if it’s playing anywhere I’m near. I actually did “Rent” at the Broward Center back in, I think, 2004. Nice! Well many people know you as Gabe from “Next to Normal” since you originated that role. Out of every show you have done, do you think that one had the biggest impact on audiences? It definitely, I think, had the biggest visceral response from an audience. I was just talking with someone today who didn’t know anything about it, and they were bawling in the theatre. That was the response from a lot of people. That show definitely struck a chord and I think what’s amazing, even today, is sometimes you don’t go there completely with the subject matter on stage, and that show really, really went there. I think that was the ultimate success of the show. We put forward this very difficult topic and dealt with it. And it was incredibly rewarding for us. We worked on this show for a long time, and even though it went through some changes, it was well received. The run and the acclaim was very nice. I’m going to be nosy for a hot second. Do you currently have someone special in your life? I am dating. I’ve been seeing someone, but it’s still in an earlier place. I’m not in a serious, serious long term relationship, but I am seeing someone, yes. And you are straight, correct? Yes. I am straight. So you’re pretty much a disappointment to every gay fan you have. [Laughs] Yes, but I very much appreciate their support and always have. Outside of performing, what are some of your other hobbies and interests? I play a lot of golf. I actually played a lot when I lived in south Florida. I try to stay active. I play in two basketball leagues and two softball leagues here in New York. That was kind of my primary focus growing up. It’s nice to get away from the daily grind and do something that turns your mind off and lets you go somewhere else. I read a lot, watch a lot of television, play video games. I’m not like a big go outer and partier, so I look for things that kind of let me hit reset button on myself. I read that you are extensively involved with charity work and plan to partner with The First Tee this spring. Can you tell me more about that? Yes. I have not worked with them yet, but we had a couple of things come through last year that I’m looking forward to. It’s our golf charity organization that’s an outreach program for underprivileged children that lets them get out on the golf course and teach them life values through the game. I think it’s a really wonderful thing that they do. I’ve been a fan of their work for a long time, and hopefully this spring I can meet some kids and work with them more actively. I also read that you turned down business scholarships to major in the arts at Ithaca College. Is that true? [Laughs] Yes. So where do you think you would be if you did not pursue acting? I don’t know. It’s very interesting because I would have graduated college in 2005 and started working. When everything kind of tanked in 2008, I was going to go to school for applied economics and be an investment banker, I could have put in two years of 80 hour weeks and gotten fired. So it’s very interesting. I thought I made a bold choice, but maybe I made the safe choice. But who knows, I always sang and always loved to sing and had a burning desire to do so. Maybe I would have ended up on “American Idol” or “The Voice,” one of those things if I was working in an office and unfulfilled. Do you currently have any other project in the works? Actually, this is the first time in a long time I don’t. I’ve been doing these shows and this is the first bit of time I’ve had off in a long, long time, so I’m totally open and looking for the next thing. I’ve been reading a lot of things and looking for whatever I do next to be great. I don’t know if it’s going to be in TV, film, or stage, but it’s an exciting time. You know great it is to work constantly, but when you do that, your availability for other opportunities is not there. So as far as the bigger picture, I’m really just sitting back and seeing what’s next. Interview from OutClique " False text

They were people I had worked with in New York.” […] We asked Tveit to play the word association game and say the first thing that came to his mind when we mentioned Broadway musicals in which he’s appeared. Here’s what he said:“Rent”: “Mind blowing. Just because it was my first job and I had seen the show on Broadway, and all of a sudden I was in it.”“Hairspray”: “Just about the most fun show I’ve ever been in.”“Catch Me If You Can”: “A dream. A dream. Just to be able to play a part like that and lead a show on Broadway and work with a dream cast.”“Wicked”: “I don’t know why this popped in my head, but ‘sass.’ ”“Next to Normal”: “Family. We were all so close and believed in that show so much. We started with each other [when] we were off-Broadway, and we knew the show was special.”  " False link

The bottom line is you sympathize with someone who is as pitiful as Red gets in the last episode. But more importantly, before then, he’s feeding the information to Laurel that matters to them discovering how to conquer this. Up until the point he saw that there were bugs, it made sense that he would stay with a good job, a good job where he could influence policy. But once he saw that there was something supernatural or metaphysical going on, the reason he stayed — as you saw he almost started to resign — was because he could feed Laurel information and because it’s very hard when your boss is pitiful and falling apart to jump away from him. Watching Gareth trying to accept this insane space bugs thing — that was great. Was it rather gratifying for you and your writers to finally get Gareth in on this?Robert King: Only because Aaron was so good. [laughs] We were all thinking that turn would come earlier. But Aaron’s performance — it was fun to think how he would react.   The surprise was we thought Luke would go through the whole series and never acknowledge there was something weird going on, and then we had this idea to go with the CIA scene. These two practical, pragmatic guys having to face that there was this weirdness going on was fun to us.  The closest we get to hearing Aaron Tveit sing is in that wild scene when they’re trying to get the bugs out of Laurel’s head. Did you ever talk about finding a way to get him singing on the show?Michelle King: I talked about it incessantly. But there was absolutely no way that the story would justify it. Nikki M. James is the other one you want to hear belt out a tune or two, but, again, there wasn’t really a way to justify that.  The Kings also state that, while nothing has been confirmed, chances for a second season are not looking good. " False link

I come home often. It’s only about an hour and a half up so I come up to see family and play golf tons. That’s right. What’s your handicap these days?Right around a 3.8. That’s pretty good. How often do you try to get out?I try to get out every day, but I usually play at least once or twice a week, even when I was working. We shot “Graceland” in Florida, so every day we shot and I played golf. It’s a little harder up here, but I go once a week, at least, which has been wonderful. Speaking of shows, “BrainDead” is fun.I think it’s fantastic. We tried to do something very different; it’s a show that does different things and crosses different genres. We had no idea if people were going to like it and get it, but I thought we executed it pretty well. Cast and crew have said “BrainDead” strangely mirrors the current American political climate.Our writers have done such a great job at putting topical stuff in the scripts. I’ll get the script and say, “Yeah, I saw this stuff in the news the other day.” I get pretty interested in politics and election season as an observer, but I was more into it this year because of the show, and of all the stuff that’s popped up. The writers have done a brilliant job of (incorporating) that. Are friends and family members coming Sunday?Yeah, a bunch of them. It’s going to be real cool; they’re all really excited. They’re so supportive and come see me from all over. But (Bethel Woods) is such an institution; people come over there from all over. The fact that I get to be there is so awesome. Tell me about your performance.I just did a big rock-pop show at Irving Plaza in June. I’m doing the same show Saturday night at the House of Blues in Boston, and it’s basically a pared-down version of that. All pop-rock covers. It’s songs I’ve loved over time. And after this you have a movie coming in October called “Better Off Single,” right?That’s the next thing that’s coming out. But after the concert Sunday I gotta leave right away; I’m flying to New Orleans for a month to shoot a movie. Then I’m coming back to New York for another movie, shooting in October. And I have a bunch of concerts and I’m waiting to see what’s going on with “BrainDead.” " False link
