We worry they hate us, are angry, are leaving us, are hurt. So, here’s a list of possible reasons why they may not be replying that aren’t those!   They’re asleep. This is kinda subjective to the time they’re in, but this included naps! Sometimes people fall asleep suddenly, or fall asleep before your reply  They’re busy. They made need to focus on something, or not be allowed on their phone. Or, they want to save their reply to you for when they can put their full attention on you and give a proper reply  They’re unsure how to reply yet. sometimes people need time to think of how to reply, and want to give a proper one  They don’t feel like talking to anyone right now. It’s not that they don’t wanna talk to you specifically- they may just be socially drained or want to focus on themselves!   They’re not in a mental place where they can reply to you. This includes perhaps they’re dissociating, or can’t think straight to reply   Their phone is dead. Plain and simple  Their wifi dropped. Same again   They’re taking pleasure time. Video games, reading anything. Sometimes people need time to relax- it doesn’t mean that they don’t enjoy talking to you, they just wanna fully immerse themselves in their activity.  They’re interacting with someone/in a situation where it’s not appropriate to use their phone. Maybe at dinner, church, a lesson, anything They suddenly have to deal with something urgent.  They forgot. I know this one is scary/hurts- but it doesn’t mean you’re not important to them! Maybe they saw your message whilst busy, thought they need to reply later, then forgot. Some people also have memory issues that mean they forget to reply to things.  They’re not logged into what you talk in. This goes esp for facebook/tumblr  They havn’t got your message. This can be for lots of reasons! Bad connection, app is broken, phone is slow, anything like that  Also, check if your message actually did send. Sometimes it’s your phone/connection that may not be working, or you simply forgot to press send. It happens!Some people reply to every single message, but some aren’t used to do that. It could be the person you texted supposed your message doesn’t need a reply / the reply is implied / they will reply when they see you in person, etc.If you’re texting someone who isn’t well-versed with technology, it might take a bit for them to reply, or they may not understand how to reply at all.Thank you for this list! c:" False text

Now, at age 90, she’s coming out as a transgender woman. She says she’s known she was a girl since the age of 3. There wasn’t common vocabulary for trans identity then, and she says if she had come out, she would have been classed as a “homosexual” in the Army and likely gone to prison.   “It feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I was living a lie,” she said, according to HuffPost UK. “I have been keeping quiet. I have slowly started to tell some of my neighbors. Everybody said ‘Don’t worry, as long as you’re happy.’” … Davies finally decided to transition in 2015 after seeing “Boy Meets Girl,” a BBC sitcom featuring transgender characters. The show made her feel that the world had progressed to the point where she could be herself. “It’s not 100 percent safe now but it’s much better than it was. People that I have told seem to be very accommodating and haven’t thrown abuse at me,” Davies said, according to HuffPost UK. “I’m known to pretty much all the old faces in the village. I’m quite content now and I wear a skirt and blouse. I don’t wear any men’s clothes any more.” “If people don’t like what they see then I don’t care but no one seems to be causing me any trouble. Nobody questions it though. Nobody seems to bat an eyelid, they accept me as I am.”  Congratulations, Patricia. ❤️  Congrats, Patricia. Thank you for your service. " False link

Maybe we have to move and we are wondering how the pet is going to come too. A job loss can make it hard to feed ourselves and our beloved pets. Luckily, there are resources out there to help you through hard times. #1 – IMOM This all-volunteer 501©(3) charity helps people cover vet bills when they just can’t do it themselves. They also help with spay/neuter and have a staff on hand to answer questions or get you the resources you need for any issues with your pet. #2 – YouCaring.com Youcaring.com is a free crowdfunding site that focuses on raising money for people who need it for personal reasons – everything from education to pet expenses. Each month, they have over 2,000 crowdfunding campaigns for people needing help with pet care costs. Recently, Cheryl Dohn raised more than $8,000 on her campaign (goal was only $2,500) to help her dog Roxy Mama. #3 – RedRover RedRover.org has grants for people who need financial support. This can be for an animal you rescued (and are fostering) or your own pet. They also have a program that helps with disaster relief, criminal seizures and hoarding cases. #4 – Harley’s Hope Foundation This nonprofit’s mission is to ensure low income pet parents and their companion or service animals remain together when issues arise. Some of the services they offer include: Pet Assistance Fund, Service Animal Aid Fund, Senior Services Project and Medical. More can be found on their website. #5 – ASPCA The ASPCA has two programs in New York City: Spay Neuter Operations and Cruelty Intervention Advocacy, which helps those facing relinquishment. In Los Angeles, they have a free spay/neuter clinic. They not only have their own programs, but can also connect you to different resources. #6 – Breed Specific Many breed rescues and groups have specials funds available for owners who need financial assistance. A few examples are the Special Needs Dobermans, Labrador Lifeline, and Pitbull Rescue Central. (H/T:Chewiesays.com) #7 – Brown Dog Foundation After going through the experience of not being able to care for her dog with cancer, Carol Smock (along with six others), started Brown Dog Foundation to help others avoid the situation Smock found herself in back in 2006. It’s a public charity “that provides funding to families who find themselves in similar situations – a sick pet that would likely respond to treatment, but due to an unforseen circumstance, there is not enough money immediately available to make it happen.” #8- Disease Specific Another route is to look for groups that help with specific diseases. For example, Canine Cancer Awareness,The Magic Bullet Fund, Helping Harley Fund, and Muffin Diabetes Fund. (H/T: Chewiesays.com)  #9 – The Pet Fund The Pet Fund provides financial assistance to owners whose pets need veterinary care. In addition to their own programs, they have a lot of resources on their site, including links to many area and/or group specific programs that may fit your needs. #10 – Banfield Charitable Trust The Banfield Pet Hospital has its own programs for owners that can’t afford their pet’s care. Of course they cover emergency surgeries, but they also cover routine, preventative care. #11 – Meals on Wheels Many people do not realize that Meals on Wheels also helps people feed their pets. Sponsored by Banfield Pet Hostpital, the Meals on Wheels Pet Program was created to make sure seniors were able to provide food for their pets. #12 – The Onyx & Breezy Foundation Another privately run nonprofit started in memory of the founder’s dogs, this foundation has a host of programs including helping people with medical bills. They also donate to many other programs, including cancer research, and they are a good resource for information if you need help finding a grant that fits your situation. " False link

He published the resulting clip, showing them dancing and laughing while holding the antisemitic message above their heads, on his YouTube channel. While some fans found the clip funny, others said the star had gone too far. Despite requesting the hateful message to be displayed, and publishing the resulting video, PewDiePie apologised to fans at the end of the video – but still gave the performers a five-star rating. He said: “I am sorry. I didn’t think they would actually do it. I feel partially responsible. I mean I’ve got to give them five stars for an outstanding experience because at least they did what I asked.” He added: “I don’t feel good. I don’t feel too proud of this, I’m not gonna lie.

That racist, disgusting, vomit inducing Antisemitic roach.  these are the two performers in question. they had an innocent business going on where they would dance in the jungle with a sign saying anything, pewdiepie exploited them by forcing them to brandish his antisemitic message, and they were banned from Fiverr (obviously a source of income for them) while pewdiepie excused himself from blame and received none. in the same video pewdiepie  paid a freelance performer to drink bleach and proceeded to smugly laugh about it said hiring graphic designers is useless and instructed the viewers to steal art from deviant art instead made fun of the entire demographic of people advertising on Fiverr (calling them people who will do “whatever i want” for $5) and took it as an excuse to exploit them, saying “they are more than happy that i am supporting their business.” and in the same grossly entitled breath, he took these two disprivileged men’s business away. called “death to jews” a “funny meme” this man and anyone who finds him funny is fucking disgusting and irrelevant.  " False link

(Applause, cheers) Rebecca, what inspired you to include these themes in the show?Rebecca Sugar: Well, in large part it’s based on my experience as a bisexual woman. (Applause, cheers) I think that there are a lot of ways that I - oh, I haven’t thought this… These themes have so much to do with who you are. There is an idea that these are themes that should not be shared with kids, but everyone shares stories about love and attraction with kids. So many stories for kids are about love. And it really makes a difference to hear stories about how someone like you can be loved. And if you don’t hear those stories, it will change who you are. It’s very important to me that we speak to kids about consent, that we speak to kids about identity, that we speak to kids about… I want to feel like I exist, and I want everyone else who wants to feel that way to feel that way too. (Loud applause, cheers)I’m not crying. You’re crying." False link
