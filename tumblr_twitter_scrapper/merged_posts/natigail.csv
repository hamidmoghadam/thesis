Ryan tells chad “I’ll show you that it’s one and the same” - that being gay is as valid as being straight, and that it is nothing to be ashamed of. ryan is clearly proud of being able to dance Ryan encourages chad to “swing like him”, bearing in mind ryan is strongly implied to be gay and the word swing is often used with regards to sexuality, ie “I don’t swing that way” Chad displays a stereotypical masculine bravado, he is clearly trying to impress Ryan, he tells him “I’ve got what it takes… so you better spin that pitch you’re gonna throw me”, while reasserting his definite heterosexuality, he adds “I’ll show you how I swing” Chad also implies that he experiences gay feelings but represses them. When ryan tells him “You’ll never know if you never try”, chad replies “there’s just one thing that stops me every time”. this shows his fear of social rejection and his own internalised homophobia as the song progresses this becomes more obvious, chad goes from saying he “doesn’t” dance to saying he “can’t” even though it is clear that he is actually a good dancer while also being skilled at baseball from this we can guess that chad is bisexual and that ryan is either bisexual or gay, though we can assume his preference lies with men at this point on top of this there is the obvious underlying sexual tension running throughout the song. they switch between confrontational and flirty; there’s a lot of smiling and eyebrow waggling going on, and when they do dance they get all up in each others personal space the song ends with ryan falling on top of chad. in the following scene, they are wearing each other’s clothes  THIS TEA!!

There were some interesting examples. Like how in Spanish, the word bridge is masculine, while in German, it is feminine. So native speakers of these languages describe the same thing differently. Spanish speakers will comment on how strong or sturdy a bridge is, while German speakers will comment on how elegant or beautiful it is. Another example that blew my mind was the Guugu Yimithirr language. So, most languages, including English, use an egocentric type of directional language (turn right, left, behind, in front.) these directions are relative to you as a person. Well, the Guugu Yimithirr language uses fixed geographical directions (North, East, South, and West) no matter the context. If you were to put an English speaker and a Guugu Yimithirr speaker in the same hotel, and put them in rooms opposite sides of the hallway from each other, the English speaker will see the exact same room (that person will see the desk to the right of blah and the closet in front of blah) but the Guugu Yimithirr speaker will see a COMPLETELY different room because the bed will be facing south instead of north, and all of that jazz. And the article went on to state how speakers of this language might even have a lower sense of egotism, because directions do not revolve around them, they’re just another part of the picture. Really fascinating.It made me think really long about language imperialism and how rapidly we’re moving towards a world that deals almost exclusively in English. It makes me sad to know that we’re losing completely different ways of thinking. Completely different perspectives, just gone. I guess that’s why I always get upset when people say that language imperialism isn’t so bad, and that English as a language is connecting people together. The world is a great big place, with completely different perspectives, and I think the fastest way to kill a culture is to take away the language, because not only are you taking away a method of communication, but a way of thinking.  Edit: since I forgot to put the source in and it’s getting traction https://mobile.nytimes.com/2010/08/29/magazine/29language-t.html?_r=0&referer=  linguistic imperialism is real and takes place in large part because of the importance (re: monetary, globalized power) that certain languages have and serve as symbolic capital. there is a linguistic hierarchy well in existence outside of English by the affluence other global powers have (i.e. French, Spanish, etc.), and well within the dialects of them too however, language DOES NOT affect the way a person thinks. this is not at all true. that theory is known as the sapir-whorf hypothesis, and many linguists, scholars, and just about anyone worth their grain of salt in the realm of language would disagree against it in a large extent because language Does Not affect the way you think. these examples are just examples of the way socialization and cultural principles you adapt take part in the way you speak, but it doesn’t necessarily tie directly into how you perceive the world language is merely a tool that’s really only developed in our species in a much shorter time than we’re generally aware of. humans use it to express the millions upon millions of abstractions and thoughts that we harbor internally and often have to limit what it is we want to express based on whatever language or languages you speak. while it is true that you experience conceptualizations based on your language, culture, and the linguistic culture you’re a part of for that code, those conceptualizations themselves that you develop are based on your own thought. influence, of course, exists, but they are not mutually exclusive components. you need language to talk about what you think, and sometimes - often, even, if you constantly find yourself having difficulty expressing yourself - human language is just so limited in achieving a complete, successful expression of thought the “bridge has different semantic meaning in languages bc of gender etc.” is a very common argument used in linguistic determinism but it holds no weight in reality. as a multilingual person, i don’t suddenly think of something like “table” as womanly, or feminine, or anything like that simply because in one of my languages it takes on the feminine gender. i don’t suddenly become unable to count a handful of pens in English just because i use a different set of counters in Japanese for objects like pens specifically. likewise, i have no issue perceiving them as simply being pens when i identify them using counter words in Japanese; they are still what they are, only that one of my language’s allows for me to refer to them differently. in much the same way, a Guugu Yimithirr speaker doesn’t suddenly begin to view the world in an entirely different way just because they’ve adapted their language to prioritize cardinal directions. that is something they NEED to be able to talk about; being able to locate themselves geographically based off of landmarks is Necessary, and as a result, they’ve been able to access that priority lexically. in contrast, some dumbass like me who lives in southern california where geographic landmarks are not nearly as prominent or crucial a concept to be known for directions (besides the ocean or smth) does not need to have as strong a sense of cardinal directions. generally speaking, people should, but in such a highly urbanized setting i live in where GPS etc. is constantly used, i linguistically do not require these concepts as urgently as a Guugu Yimithirr person would. it has nothing to do with their ego-centrism or lack thereof. although there’s no argument here that americans typically have that type of character LOL many languages that are not a part of the “important” global scale of countries are dying, and as a linguist and poc, it makes me really fucking sad to know how frequent and quickly it happens. however, linguistic determinism / “language affecting thought” has nothing to do with it. if anything, assuming people who refer to the world differently based on their language(s) generally becomes a means through which Western scholars (usually English speakers) alien and other these speakers, who are often indigenous peoples. here’s a good post w/a simplified explanation against determinism, and a more verbose and highly jargon-ed but readable one here  Here’s an excellent post over why the article should be taken critically. It also explains why it’s problematic. Please read. I don’t want to spread misinformation. " False text

This scene determines whether your reader is pulled in or puts the book down. Here are some important do’s and don’ts. DO write it as a scene, not a data dump. You may have a fantastic premise, a marvelous alternate history or post-apocalyptic world or magical realism to die for, but if you don’t engage your reader in an actual scene, you will bore them. DO write a scene that immediately introduces a character that the reader can root for. Yes, I know Stephen King has had great success introducing victims that are then shortly afterward killed off. That’s a horror trope and we expect it. But if you are caught up in world-building and haven’t dreamed your way into a character who is worth following through 100,000 words of writing, your story is pointless. I have read many pieces of fiction by would-be writers who can’t grasp this essential concept, and without exception, they fail to engage the reader. DO introduce the stakes right away. In case that’s a challenge that needs some exposition to develop, create some immediate stakes (a life threat works) that keep the tension high and the reader engaged until you can lay out the larger stakes. DO begin in medias res, which means “in the middle of things.” Most beginning fiction writers make the mistake of starting too early in the plot. Meet the monster on page 1.  DON’T include a flashback in the first chapter. Work on a scene, which means time is NOT compressed. It should include dialog, action, description, setting, and interior monolog. Keep everything happening within that scene for at least the first chapter. You can bring in a flashback in Chapter Three. DON’T shift points of view within a single chapter. Let the reader establish a strong bond of interest (even if it’s with a POV villain) over the course of a whole chapter. DON’T open the story with your character waking up unless it’s because she’s got a gun in her face (or a knife to her throat – you get what I mean). We don’t need to follow a character through their mundane daily routine.  DON’T be coy. Beginning writers often have this idea that they need to hold back on revealing all their secrets – what’s in the box, who’s behind the curtain, where they’re going next, etc. Their well-meant plan is to slowly reveal all this over several chapters. Trust me on this one: tell your readers instead of keeping it a mystery. You WILL come up with more secrets to reveal. Your imagination is that good. Spill it now, and allow that revelation to add to the excitement. " False text

I feel like I want to do things but at the same time I just want to curl under my blanket and hide in my bed surrounded by unhealthy snacks while watching my favourite shows or YouTube videos. It’s been a long weekend full of social interaction and I always seem to forget how much that tears into me and makes me feel fragile. Sometimes when I finally get alone after long days, I will feel like the slightest nudge will make me fracture and shatter to pieces. This past weekend I participated in a dressage competition with my horse - something I used to do more regularly when I was younger but over the last few years life has just gotten in the way. I was never highly competitive but when the weekend started out I could feel that special thing in the air: anticipation for the days that were about to pass. So many of my friends and their horses would compete as well and I was excited for my stables to host the competition. Two days later and after two dressage programmes, I just feel a bit empty and like I’m at a stand-still. I made the mistake of reading through old assessments and upon reading the judge’s commentary I feel like I’ve gotten stuck and not improved as much as I should. It’s a ridiculous notion because I never got a horse for the competitive aspect of it. I love our day to day training or going for a forest ride or just spending bonding time with her, so I don’t know why this is hitting me so hard. I have an answer, I suppose, but I don’t like it. I’m just feeling overwhelmed and tomorrow this hollow feeling will leave me and I’ll have forgotten all about these thoughts. I become vulnerable and sensitive when I don’t have the time to stop and breathe and step away from everything. Luckily, I had nothing on the schedule until this evening, so I’ve been confining myself to my bed and watching loads of YouTube videos. However, there’s that nagging in the back of my mind that I’m wasting my precious time “recharging” - I should do my university readings, I should write the stories that sit unfinished on my computer, I should have gone for a run or at least a walk with my dog, I should have written down my feelings about this past weekend while the memories are still fresh, I should have gotten into the shower hours ago. Life is strange and I don’t know what to do about that. I have my logical side that still is hitting myself over the head for wasting my limited time, even as my mind begs me to take this time and not feel guilty about it. All of this will fade soon and if I manage to drag myself into the shower (I will because I’m a stubborn bastard and I already feel lighter after writing these words), the warm water will wash over my body and my tense joints will loosen up and my mind will clear momentarily. I’ll grab this clarity and run with it because in two hours I’m heading out the door with my family to see a show. Life goes on even when you just want to dig in your heels and tell everything to slow down. I’m the type of person that doesn’t want to miss out on anything, so I won’t stay home. I’ll stop writing now and go turn on the shower. If anyone is reading this, I’m sorry if my melancholy rubbed off on you. Honestly, I will be all better in just an hour - I can feel the fog in my mind lifting already. Maybe, if you were to get anything from this, let this be a reminder (both to you and my future self) that it doesn’t do you any good to look back at the past and feel sad you didn’t do as well as you might have expected. You probably did do a lot but you can’t see it if you turn on a narrow self-deprevating vision. I love my horse dearly and I know for a fact we’ve gotten better at working together over the last few years even if I don’t have judges’ assessments to prove it. I don’t need them. I know us better than they ever will for the five minute we perform in front of their watchful eyes. I know I’ve moved forward and I know I need time to recharge after spending too much time with people. It’s okay. I’m okay. If you’ve ever felt like I do at this very moment, trust yourself to know that it’ll be okay.  Whoops, my hand slipped and I spilled some words onto my screen. It felt very therapeutic to write this." False text
