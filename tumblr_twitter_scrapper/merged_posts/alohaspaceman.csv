I spent much of the past week speaking with officials and cabinet ministers in Europe. All they wanted to talk about was Trump.¬† Here, in summary, are the most frequent remarks I heard from them, and from others in my travels, in rough order of frequency: 1. Trump is unstable, and we‚Äôre not going to count on anything he says or commits to.  2. Trump doesn‚Äôt support NATO or European integration.  3. Trump is actively encouraging racist nationalists in our country.  4. Trump is allied with Putin to bring Europe down.  5. There‚Äôs no doubt Trump worked with Putin to win the U.S. presidential election. 6. If Trump‚Äôs polls drop too low, he‚Äôll start a war in order to get Americans to rally around him. (Opinions varied on whether Trump‚Äôs war would be with North Korea, Iran, terrorists in Nigeria, or an escalation in Syria, Iraq, or Afghanistan.) 7. How did you Americans come to elect this ego-maniac? (Others called him an infant, moron, ignoramus, fool.) 8. He‚Äôs another Berlusconi (or Franco, Mussolini, Salazar, Hitler). 9.

alohaspaceman 160952192001 "2017-05-22 16:50:04 GMT" https://alohaspaceman.tumblr.com/post/160952192001/how-alex-oloughlin-found-his-aloha-spirit "  It was early 2010 and the Australian actor had just been offered the lead role on the reboot of the classic crime drama Hawaii Five-0, stepping into the shoes of the legendary Jack Lord to play the 50th state‚Äôs taciturn top cop, Steve McGarrett. Accepting meant moving to Oahu, in the center of the planet‚Äôs loveliest island archipelago. It should have been a no-brainer. Cue that big wave and the theme song by the Ventures:Dum-duh-da-da-da-dum‚Ä¶‚ÄúI was conflicted,‚Äù Alex O'Loughlin says, reflecting on the decision from his house in Waikiki‚Äôs idyllic Diamond Head. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd done two network shows before that, neither of which had gone past a season.‚Äù He‚Äôd played vampire/private investigator Mick St. John on the short-lived 2007 supernatural romance Moonlight. A year later, he was Dr. Andy Yablonski on the medical drama Three Rivers, canceled after just eight episodes. Though anything seemed better than being penniless in Los Angeles, to suffer through another failed show in the middle of the Pacific, 2,500 miles from the mainland, was a risk he wasn‚Äôt sure he wanted to take.‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know anything about Hawaii. I asked everyone, ‚ÄòWhat do I do? Is this the right move?‚Äô‚Äù O‚ÄôLoughlin says. ‚ÄúEverybody was like, 'Are you crazy? What‚Äôs wrong with you?‚Äô‚ÄùHe took the gig, staying on Waikiki Beach. For fans of the show, that‚Äôs where McGarrett and partner Danny ‚ÄúDanno‚Äù Williams were recently snookered into a joint spa weekend with their significant others.    ‚ÄúIt was beautiful, but I didn‚Äôt get to see the real Hawaii,‚Äù O'Loughlin says. ‚ÄúI got a glimpse of something that wasn‚Äôt what Hawaii is. The weird, touristy, crazy hotel part. I still didn‚Äôt know how I felt about it, but the pilot felt really good.‚ÄùIt was, and remains, a really good pilot. In the nail-biting prelude, naval commander McGarrett‚Äôs convoy comes under rocket fire in the mountains of South Korea by baddies out to free his arms-dealer prisoner, Anton Hesse. Amid the attack, McGarrett listens on his satellite phone as his father, John, is killed on Oahu by Anton‚Äôs brother, Victor‚Äîthough not before the Honolulu Police Department veteran leaves his son a few cryptic last words.By the time that wave breaks and the opening credits roll, you‚Äôre hooked: McGarrett has a vendetta and a mystery to solve, and you‚Äôre coming along with him. Reboots are tough, but the show‚Äôs depth, coupled with O'Loughlin‚Äôs chiseled portrayal of McGarrett, made the 21st century Hawaii Five-0 an instant hit. Suddenly, Oahu started feeling more certain.‚ÄúPeople say these islands either embrace you or push you away,‚Äù O'Loughlin says. ‚ÄúI found myself, as a gift from the islands, being blessed in and given a Hawaiian name. I found all sorts of things drawing me in deeper and deeper.‚Äù    With a full season to shoot, he started to learn the local rhythms from friends, like fellow cast member Daniel Dae Kim, whose knowledge of Oahu stretches back to his days filming Lost. He took up surfing. A few years in, he flew in some friends from back home in Australia to help him rebuild a midcentury modern home he‚Äôd found in Diamond Head that had ‚Äúspectacular bones.‚ÄùThen he met the Hawaiian surfer and model Malia Jones. The couple had a son, Lion, in 2012, and later married. The house filled with boys. O'Loughlin brought to the family his teenage son, Saxon, and Jones brought a son from a previous marriage, Spike.‚ÄúI‚Äôm about to use the G word to embrace the scope,‚Äù O'Loughlin says. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs out there. I don‚Äôt know whether there‚Äôs a God or whether there‚Äôs lots of gods or whether there‚Äôs just universal energy, but I know from what‚Äôs happened that there‚Äôs something bigger than me.‚ÄùAs O'Loughlin‚Äôs life was progressing on Oahu, so was McGarrett‚Äôs, albeit down a much rockier family path. He avenged the death of his father. His mother, Doris, believed to be dead for 20 years, turned up alive, having faked her death to escape threats from her CIA past.He vanquished his true nemesis‚Äîthe nefarious crime boss Wo Fat‚Äîwho over the course of seasons framed him for the murder of Hawaii‚Äôs governor, kidnapped and tortured him, and revealed himself to be McGarrett‚Äôs virtual half-brother. He‚Äôs had two romantic relationships and has spent a lot of time shirtless and even more time kicking sundry bad guy ass.Hawaii Five-0 seasons are epic‚Äîeach a whopping 25 episodes. Multiply that by six and you wind up at Episode 150. Playing a character for that long does things to you. O'Loughlin is in territory where few actors ever get to tread. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs such a massive volume,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThis has been a master class for me. I can definitely drop into McGarrett‚Äôs head space anytime. I have a bible of who he is in my soul, in my mind.‚ÄùWith Wo Fat and his family issues somewhat in the rearview, McGarrett seems to be finding a modicum of peace on the show. ‚ÄúThis season has been more of an easy-peasy McGarrett,‚Äù O‚ÄôLoughlin says. ‚ÄúHe still misses his dad, and the thing with Doris still hasn‚Äôt totally left him. But it‚Äôs not all like, 'Argh! I‚Äôve got to save the world!‚Äô‚ÄùStill, O'Loughlin is happy to leave the character behind when shooting wraps. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a proper tough guy and a Navy SEAL. He‚Äôs always ready to go, walking into rooms like, 'What are we doing? What do we got?‚Äô I‚Äôve had the great fortune of being exposed to a lot of Navy SEALs, who‚Äôve helped me with the character. They‚Äôre terrific guys. But being like them requires a specific sort of energy, and I have to manufacture that energy,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAt the end of the day it‚Äôs like, 'Keep calm and have another cold one.‚Äô‚Äù    Paradise hasn‚Äôt been all surf and breathtaking sunsets. McGarrett may be a SEAL and a Teflon super-cop, but O'Loughlin isn‚Äôt, and injuries have taken their toll. In the first few seasons, he elected to do most of his own stunts, which he says was a mistake. He rattles off a litany of fractures and lacerations that could rival a snapshot collection of charts in any emergency room.‚ÄúI blew one of my knees, I‚Äôve torn ligaments and tendons, ankles, both shoulders, both wrists,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve knocked my front teeth out. I‚Äôve got fake front teeth. I tore my right shoulder to pieces‚Äîthree external tears, a labrum tear and a detachment of the bicep tendon. My current favorite injury is two herniated discs in my lower lumbar, which I‚Äôm receiving stem cell treatment for to avoid surgery.‚ÄùThat last injury spooked O'Loughlin. Always athletic, he had to give up everything except swimming. The pain was so great, he could barely rouse himself from bed, and he worried about being able to throw a football with his grandkids.Signed on to Hawaii Five-0 through eight seasons, he began talking about walking away while he felt he still could. But recently, he‚Äôs felt his workload lighten, and those stem cell injections? They‚Äôve been ‚Äúmagic,‚Äù he says. Does this mean he might challenge Jack Lord‚Äôs record 12 seasons as McGarrett?‚ÄúThat would be a miracle,‚Äù O‚ÄôLoughlin says with a laugh. ‚ÄúBut I can see coming back and doing another season or two. I think this show is everything. It‚Äôs the core of it all.‚ÄùOne thing is certain: O'Loughlin has found his home.‚ÄúThe majority of my important memories are now Hawaiian memories,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve just got to look around. You‚Äôve just got to watch the waves in the winter here. There‚Äôs something bigger than me in the world, and I feel like that source or whatever that is had something to do with this whole journey for me, because now it all makes sense.‚ÄùBy Ryan Devlin | Photography by Nino Mu√±oz | Styled by Lily Unkhoff.Originally published in Watch!

Doctor finds anecdotal evidence that people are passing kidney stones after riding on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad at Disney World 2. Doctor makes 3-D model of kidney, complete with stones and urine (his own), takes it on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad 60 times 3.¬†‚ÄúThe stones passed 63.89 percent of the time while the kidneys were in the back of the car. When they were in the front, the passage rate was only 16.67 percent. That‚Äôs based on only 60 rides on a single coaster, and Wartinger guards his excitement in the journal article: ‚ÄòPreliminary study findings support the anecdotal evidence that a ride on a moderate-intensity roller coaster could benefit some patients with small kidney stones.‚Äô‚Äù 4.¬†‚ÄúSome rides are going to be more advantageous for some patients than other rides.

Snagglepuss isn‚Äôt as well-known as some Hanna-Barbera cartoons like Scooby-Doo or The Smurfs, so you‚Äôd be forgiven for mistaking him for the Pink Panther.

This installment will be more action-packed than the previous episode, but will also have a huge emotional impact on Kono (Grace Park). ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to play into a bigger arc and a little bit of a cliffhanger for her at the end of this season, and something that she‚Äôs committed to seeing through,‚Äù showrunner Peter Lenkov tells TVGuide.com. ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs not just something that‚Äôs happening on the island. It‚Äôs an epidemic that‚Äôs happening all over the country. So, she sort of takes on this cause singlehandedly, and is determined to find anybody who‚Äôs behind sex trafficking. It‚Äôs a little bit of a heavier story for us, but it‚Äôs a good journey for her and it‚Äôs great for us, because it‚Äôs real and it‚Äôs got a lot of weight behind it.‚Äù But will Kono‚Äôs commitment to the cause pull her away from Five-0?

Primarily, she is making it possible for Americans, who have always presumed a level of trust and competence in our government, to see and track the creeping normalization of the trump autocracy.   Adult children of authoritarians are useful in three ways: first, they tend to be trustworthy confidants in regimes rife with paranoia, as corrupt authoritarian states usually are. Second, they are excellent vessels for laundering money, ¬†creating enough distance that assets stolen from the state are harder to track. Third, they tend to have a warmer public profile which offsets the brutality of the dictator by distracting the population with pictures of their happy families or glamorous lifestyle. For nearly two years, Jared and Ivanka have been peddled by the press as a ‚Äúmoderating influence‚Äù on her vulgar, bigoted father. They have done nothing to merit this characterization. When hate crimes rose in tandem with the Trump campaign, Ivanka and Jared were silent. When xenophobes like Michael Flynn ‚Äì the former NSA head revealed to be a foreign agent ‚Äì screeched tirades at the Republican National Convention, Ivanka and her siblings dutifully followed on stage. When Trump filled his cabinet with white supremacists like Steve Bannon, Nazis like Seb Gorka, and racists like Jeff Sessions, Ivanka and Jared did not distance themselves, but joined the team.

To get emotionally invested, you have to really care  that she needs to find out who she is. But when she finally meets her  mom, my gut felt so weird in that moment. Kato-Kiriyama: That scene was devastating on all  levels. It got me because of the emotion of the mother [veteran Japanese  actress Kaori Momoi]. She‚Äôs really wonderful. That scene should have  been beautiful, but Major had nothing in her eyes. Acting-wise, what a  missed moment. Atsuko Okatsuka: I wasn‚Äôt aware they were gonna  explain the whitewashing.

And then to be like, ‚ÄúOh shit, I used to be a  Japanese woman!‚Äù (Laughter) That was against my expectations. How did you feel when that twist was revealed? Agena: That was hard, y‚Äôall. Hard and awkward. Ai Yoshihara: Major‚Äôs backstory is white people trying to justify the casting. Okatsuka: And they f‚Äîed up in the process because  now it looks even worse. The text at the beginning of the movie  explained that Hanka Robotics is making a being that‚Äôs the best of human  and the best of robotics. For some reason, the best stuff they make  happens to be white. Michael Pitt used to be Hideo. Agena: That was the other cringe-worthy moment, when  they called each other by their Japanese names. We‚Äôre looking at these  beautiful white bodies saying these Japanese names, and it hurt my heart  a little bit. Kato-Kiriyama: It was supposed to be so touching and intimate, and it felt gross. And kind of laugh-worthy at the same time. Okatsuka: I would have preferred them just using American names. ‚ÄúYou used to be Bob.‚Äù   When THR interviewed Japanese fans about the whitewashing claims, they weren‚Äôt bothered by it, and neither was Mamoru Oshii, who directed the 1995 anime version. How do you feel about their response? Yoshihara: People in Japan worship white people. Kato-Kiriyama: Even in the story, there are Japanese people involved in creating these beings and they also may very well see the ideal human being as a white woman. So you‚Äôre sort of messed up all the way around. Agena: Yes! I felt more messed up watching this movie. It reinforced my own personal messed-up standards of physical beauty.

I‚Äôm back now and didn‚Äôt want to let any more time go by without reaching out. By now many of you have heard the news, and I‚Äôm sad to say it is true. I will not be returning to Hawaii Five-0 when production starts next week. Though I made myselfavailable to come back, CBS and I weren‚Äôt able to agree to terms on a new contract, so I made the difficult choice not to continue. As sad as it feels to say goodbye, what I feel most is gratitude. I am so deeply thankful to our crew, writers and everyone associated with the show ‚Äì and especially the cast, who have been nothing but supportive through this entire process. They and the crew have been my second family for seven years and I wish them nothing but success for season 8 - and beyond.I also want to say to thank you to Peter Lenkov, Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci and everyone at CBS. I will always be grateful for their faith in me to bring Chin Ho Kelly to life. As an Asian American actor, I know first-hand how difficult it is to find opportunities at all, let alone play a well developed, three dimensional character like Chin Ho. I will miss him sincerely. What made him even more special is that he was a representative of a place my family and I so dearly love. It has been nothing short of an honor to be able to showcase the beauty and people of Hawaii every week, and I couldn‚Äôt be prouder to call these islands home. To my local community, mahalo nui loa.Finally, I want to thank all of you, the fans. I‚Äôve read your messages and I can‚Äôt tell you how much they‚Äôve meant to me. I never, ever forget that YOU are the reason Hawaii Five-0 is the success that it is, and interacting with you online and in person around the world(!) has been one of the greatest joys of this entire experience. I‚Äôm so sorry we won‚Äôt be continuing this journey together. I‚Äôll end by saying that though transitions can be difficult, I encourage us all to look beyond the disappointment of this moment to the bigger picture. The path to equality is rarely easy. But I hope you can be excited for the future. I am. 5-0 continues on after one of its strongest seasons. I‚Äôve got new acting projects on the horizon, and as a producer, my company, 3AD, has its first show, THE GOOD DOCTOR, set to air this fall on ABC. I hope you‚Äôll tune in. There‚Äôs a lot to look forward to and I‚Äôll be sure to share it with you. In the meantime, Aloha, thank you and Happy Independence Day!-DDK" True text

While we could not reach an agreement, we  part ways with tremendous respect for their talents on screen, as well  as their roles as ambassadors for the show off screen, and with hopes to  work with them again in the near future.‚Äù¬†Kim lifted the veil on the dealmaking process with a Facebook post Wednesday ¬†asserting  that he was not able to come to terms with CBS on a deal and that ‚Äúthe  path to equality is rarely easy.‚Äù It‚Äôs understood that Kim and Park  sought pay parity with the series‚Äô lead actors, Alex O‚ÄôLoughlin and  Scott Caan. The fact that Kim and Park are of Asian descent while  O‚ÄôLoughlin and Caan are Caucasian added an inevitable racial component  to the situation at a time of heightened focus on diversity at all  levels of the entertainment industry. CBS executives were said to be  troubled by the suggestion from media coverage of Kim and Park‚Äôs  departures that race played a role in a business negotiation.Industry sources said O‚ÄôLoughlin and Caan  are making about $200,000 per episode apiece for the upcoming eighth  season of the show, produced by CBS Television Studios. A source close  to the situation said CBS‚Äô last per-episode salary offer to Kim was  about $5,000 apart from the two lead actors, and CBS offered to set a  new overall deal with Kim‚Äôs 3AD production banner. However, sources  close to Kim said the differential was more significant.The dispute on the difference in  compensation levels may hinge on the fact that O‚ÄôLoughlin and Caan have a  small share of the backend profits of the show. ‚ÄúHawaii Five-0‚Äù  commanded a lucrative $2 million-per-episode cable syndication deal with  TNT in 2011, although the show turned out to be a lackluster performer  for the cabler. It remains a successful property for CBS in  international markets ‚Äî all of which means O‚ÄôLoughlin and Caan‚Äôs profit  participation stakes probably plump up their take-home pay  considerably. Park, meanwhile, was said to have sought a  deal for less than half of a full season‚Äôs worth of episodes, which  would have been a financially challenging prospect for the network at  the salary that she sought. ‚ÄúHawaii Five-0‚Äù delivered some 25 episodes  in its most recent season.Sources close to the situation noted that Kim and Park did not  negotiate as a unit in their discussions with CBS. The final offer for  Park was lower than that for Kim, according to a source.From Kim and Park‚Äôs perspective, it‚Äôs clear that the lack of pay  parity with O‚ÄôLoughlin and Caan after seven seasons as central  characters was a deal-breaker. Kim is also revving up his activity as a  producer. His 3AD banner landed a new medical drama series on ABC for  the coming season, ‚ÄúThe Good Doctor,‚Äù starring Freddie Highmore.From CBS‚Äô perspective, Kim and Park remained supporting players and  there was a need to adhere, for precedent‚Äôs sake, to a traditional  differential between the job categories. The backend stakes that  O‚ÄôLoughlin and Caan commanded reflect the leverage that the two actors  brought to the show when it was assembled in the 2009-2010 development  cycle.O‚ÄôLoughlin and Caan have one more season to go on their contract with the show."
