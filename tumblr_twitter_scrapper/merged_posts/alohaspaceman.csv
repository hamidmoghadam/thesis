I spent much of the past week speaking with officials and cabinet ministers in Europe. All they wanted to talk about was Trump.  Here, in summary, are the most frequent remarks I heard from them, and from others in my travels, in rough order of frequency: 1. Trump is unstable, and we’re not going to count on anything he says or commits to.  2. Trump doesn’t support NATO or European integration.  3. Trump is actively encouraging racist nationalists in our country.  4. Trump is allied with Putin to bring Europe down.  5. There’s no doubt Trump worked with Putin to win the U.S. presidential election. 6. If Trump’s polls drop too low, he’ll start a war in order to get Americans to rally around him. (Opinions varied on whether Trump’s war would be with North Korea, Iran, terrorists in Nigeria, or an escalation in Syria, Iraq, or Afghanistan.) 7. How did you Americans come to elect this ego-maniac? (Others called him an infant, moron, ignoramus, fool.) 8. He’s another Berlusconi (or Franco, Mussolini, Salazar, Hitler). 9. We remember fascism. We never thought it would happen in America.  10. The world depends on American leadership. We’re very worried. My overall impression: Anti-Trump sentiment is even stronger in Europe than it is in the U.S. If Trump expects his European trip to give him a reprieve from his troubles at home, he’s mistaken.  😰 " False text

Accepting meant moving to Oahu, in the center of the planet’s loveliest island archipelago. It should have been a no-brainer. Cue that big wave and the theme song by the Ventures:Dum-duh-da-da-da-dum…“I was conflicted,” Alex O'Loughlin says, reflecting on the decision from his house in Waikiki’s idyllic Diamond Head. “I’d done two network shows before that, neither of which had gone past a season.” He’d played vampire/private investigator Mick St. John on the short-lived 2007 supernatural romance Moonlight. A year later, he was Dr. Andy Yablonski on the medical drama Three Rivers, canceled after just eight episodes. Though anything seemed better than being penniless in Los Angeles, to suffer through another failed show in the middle of the Pacific, 2,500 miles from the mainland, was a risk he wasn’t sure he wanted to take.“I didn’t know anything about Hawaii. I asked everyone, ‘What do I do? Is this the right move?’” O’Loughlin says. “Everybody was like, 'Are you crazy? What’s wrong with you?’”He took the gig, staying on Waikiki Beach. For fans of the show, that’s where McGarrett and partner Danny “Danno” Williams were recently snookered into a joint spa weekend with their significant others.    “It was beautiful, but I didn’t get to see the real Hawaii,” O'Loughlin says. “I got a glimpse of something that wasn’t what Hawaii is. The weird, touristy, crazy hotel part. I still didn’t know how I felt about it, but the pilot felt really good.”It was, and remains, a really good pilot. In the nail-biting prelude, naval commander McGarrett’s convoy comes under rocket fire in the mountains of South Korea by baddies out to free his arms-dealer prisoner, Anton Hesse. Amid the attack, McGarrett listens on his satellite phone as his father, John, is killed on Oahu by Anton’s brother, Victor—though not before the Honolulu Police Department veteran leaves his son a few cryptic last words.By the time that wave breaks and the opening credits roll, you’re hooked: McGarrett has a vendetta and a mystery to solve, and you’re coming along with him. Reboots are tough, but the show’s depth, coupled with O'Loughlin’s chiseled portrayal of McGarrett, made the 21st century Hawaii Five-0 an instant hit. Suddenly, Oahu started feeling more certain.“People say these islands either embrace you or push you away,” O'Loughlin says. “I found myself, as a gift from the islands, being blessed in and given a Hawaiian name. I found all sorts of things drawing me in deeper and deeper.”    With a full season to shoot, he started to learn the local rhythms from friends, like fellow cast member Daniel Dae Kim, whose knowledge of Oahu stretches back to his days filming Lost. He took up surfing. A few years in, he flew in some friends from back home in Australia to help him rebuild a midcentury modern home he’d found in Diamond Head that had “spectacular bones.”Then he met the Hawaiian surfer and model Malia Jones. The couple had a son, Lion, in 2012, and later married. The house filled with boys. O'Loughlin brought to the family his teenage son, Saxon, and Jones brought a son from a previous marriage, Spike.“I’m about to use the G word to embrace the scope,” O'Loughlin says. “I don’t know what’s out there. I don’t know whether there’s a God or whether there’s lots of gods or whether there’s just universal energy, but I know from what’s happened that there’s something bigger than me.”As O'Loughlin’s life was progressing on Oahu, so was McGarrett’s, albeit down a much rockier family path. He avenged the death of his father. His mother, Doris, believed to be dead for 20 years, turned up alive, having faked her death to escape threats from her CIA past.He vanquished his true nemesis—the nefarious crime boss Wo Fat—who over the course of seasons framed him for the murder of Hawaii’s governor, kidnapped and tortured him, and revealed himself to be McGarrett’s virtual half-brother. He’s had two romantic relationships and has spent a lot of time shirtless and even more time kicking sundry bad guy ass.Hawaii Five-0 seasons are epic—each a whopping 25 episodes. Multiply that by six and you wind up at Episode 150. Playing a character for that long does things to you. O'Loughlin is in territory where few actors ever get to tread. “It’s such a massive volume,” he says. “This has been a master class for me. I can definitely drop into McGarrett’s head space anytime. I have a bible of who he is in my soul, in my mind.”With Wo Fat and his family issues somewhat in the rearview, McGarrett seems to be finding a modicum of peace on the show. “This season has been more of an easy-peasy McGarrett,” O’Loughlin says. “He still misses his dad, and the thing with Doris still hasn’t totally left him. But it’s not all like, 'Argh! I’ve got to save the world!’”Still, O'Loughlin is happy to leave the character behind when shooting wraps. “He’s a proper tough guy and a Navy SEAL. He’s always ready to go, walking into rooms like, 'What are we doing? What do we got?’ I’ve had the great fortune of being exposed to a lot of Navy SEALs, who’ve helped me with the character. They’re terrific guys. But being like them requires a specific sort of energy, and I have to manufacture that energy,” he says. “At the end of the day it’s like, 'Keep calm and have another cold one.’”    Paradise hasn’t been all surf and breathtaking sunsets. McGarrett may be a SEAL and a Teflon super-cop, but O'Loughlin isn’t, and injuries have taken their toll. In the first few seasons, he elected to do most of his own stunts, which he says was a mistake. He rattles off a litany of fractures and lacerations that could rival a snapshot collection of charts in any emergency room.“I blew one of my knees, I’ve torn ligaments and tendons, ankles, both shoulders, both wrists,” he says. “I’ve knocked my front teeth out. I’ve got fake front teeth. I tore my right shoulder to pieces—three external tears, a labrum tear and a detachment of the bicep tendon. My current favorite injury is two herniated discs in my lower lumbar, which I’m receiving stem cell treatment for to avoid surgery.”That last injury spooked O'Loughlin. Always athletic, he had to give up everything except swimming. The pain was so great, he could barely rouse himself from bed, and he worried about being able to throw a football with his grandkids.Signed on to Hawaii Five-0 through eight seasons, he began talking about walking away while he felt he still could. But recently, he’s felt his workload lighten, and those stem cell injections? They’ve been “magic,” he says. Does this mean he might challenge Jack Lord’s record 12 seasons as McGarrett?“That would be a miracle,” O’Loughlin says with a laugh. “But I can see coming back and doing another season or two. I think this show is everything. It’s the core of it all.”One thing is certain: O'Loughlin has found his home.“The majority of my important memories are now Hawaiian memories,” he says. “You’ve just got to look around. You’ve just got to watch the waves in the winter here. There’s something bigger than me in the world, and I feel like that source or whatever that is had something to do with this whole journey for me, because now it all makes sense.”By Ryan Devlin | Photography by Nino Muñoz | Styled by Lily Unkhoff.Originally published in Watch!

Doctor makes 3-D model of kidney, complete with stones and urine (his own), takes it on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad 60 times 3. “The stones passed 63.89 percent of the time while the kidneys were in the back of the car. When they were in the front, the passage rate was only 16.67 percent. That’s based on only 60 rides on a single coaster, and Wartinger guards his excitement in the journal article: ‘Preliminary study findings support the anecdotal evidence that a ride on a moderate-intensity roller coaster could benefit some patients with small kidney stones.’” 4. “Some rides are going to be more advantageous for some patients than other rides. So I wouldn’t say that the only ride that helps you pass stones is Big Thunder Mountain. That’s grossly inaccurate.” 5. “His advice for now: If you know you have a stone that’s smaller than five millimeters, riding a series of roller coasters could help you pass that stone before it gets to an obstructive size and either causes debilitating colic or requires a $10,000 procedure to try and break it up. And even once a stone is broken up using shock waves, tiny fragments and “dust” remain that need to be passed. The coaster could help with that, too.” SCIENCE: IT WORKS  Update:  “In all, we used 174 kidney stones of varying shapes, sizes and weights to see if each model worked on the same ride and on two other roller coasters,” Wartinger said. “Big Thunder Mountain was the only one that worked. We tried Space Mountain and Aerosmith’s Rock ‘n’ Roller Coaster and both failed.”Wartinger went on to explain that these other rides are too fast and too violent with a G-force that pins the stone into the kidney and doesn’t allow it to pass.“The ideal coaster is rough and quick with some twists and turns, but no upside down or inverted movements,” he said.

It’s an epidemic that’s happening all over the country. So, she sort of takes on this cause singlehandedly, and is determined to find anybody who’s behind sex trafficking. It’s a little bit of a heavier story for us, but it’s a good journey for her and it’s great for us, because it’s real and it’s got a lot of weight behind it.” But will Kono’s commitment to the cause pull her away from Five-0? Anything’s possible.  " True link

Primarily, she is making it possible for Americans, who have always presumed a level of trust and competence in our government, to see and track the creeping normalization of the trump autocracy.   Adult children of authoritarians are useful in three ways: first, they tend to be trustworthy confidants in regimes rife with paranoia, as corrupt authoritarian states usually are. Second, they are excellent vessels for laundering money,  creating enough distance that assets stolen from the state are harder to track. Third, they tend to have a warmer public profile which offsets the brutality of the dictator by distracting the population with pictures of their happy families or glamorous lifestyle. For nearly two years, Jared and Ivanka have been peddled by the press as a “moderating influence” on her vulgar, bigoted father. They have done nothing to merit this characterization. When hate crimes rose in tandem with the Trump campaign, Ivanka and Jared were silent. When xenophobes like Michael Flynn – the former NSA head revealed to be a foreign agent – screeched tirades at the Republican National Convention, Ivanka and her siblings dutifully followed on stage. When Trump filled his cabinet with white supremacists like Steve Bannon, Nazis like Seb Gorka, and racists like Jeff Sessions, Ivanka and Jared did not distance themselves, but joined the team. This is not a “moderating influence”; this is complicity.  Take a minute to read this whole column, and please share it. " False link

Traci Kato-Kiriyama: It was stunning visually, but emotionally it didn’t draw me in. Keiko Agena: It was harder to watch than I thought  it was gonna be. To get emotionally invested, you have to really care  that she needs to find out who she is. But when she finally meets her  mom, my gut felt so weird in that moment. Kato-Kiriyama: That scene was devastating on all  levels. It got me because of the emotion of the mother [veteran Japanese  actress Kaori Momoi]. She’s really wonderful. That scene should have  been beautiful, but Major had nothing in her eyes. Acting-wise, what a  missed moment. Atsuko Okatsuka: I wasn’t aware they were gonna  explain the whitewashing. I thought it was just going to be an action  film, no explanation, just go with the fact that it’s a future Japan  with this robot cop. And then to be like, “Oh shit, I used to be a  Japanese woman!” (Laughter) That was against my expectations. How did you feel when that twist was revealed? Agena: That was hard, y’all. Hard and awkward. Ai Yoshihara: Major’s backstory is white people trying to justify the casting. Okatsuka: And they f—ed up in the process because  now it looks even worse. The text at the beginning of the movie  explained that Hanka Robotics is making a being that’s the best of human  and the best of robotics. For some reason, the best stuff they make  happens to be white. Michael Pitt used to be Hideo. Agena: That was the other cringe-worthy moment, when  they called each other by their Japanese names. We’re looking at these  beautiful white bodies saying these Japanese names, and it hurt my heart  a little bit. Kato-Kiriyama: It was supposed to be so touching and intimate, and it felt gross. And kind of laugh-worthy at the same time. Okatsuka: I would have preferred them just using American names. “You used to be Bob.”   When THR interviewed Japanese fans about the whitewashing claims, they weren’t bothered by it, and neither was Mamoru Oshii, who directed the 1995 anime version. How do you feel about their response? Yoshihara: People in Japan worship white people. Kato-Kiriyama: Even in the story, there are Japanese people involved in creating these beings and they also may very well see the ideal human being as a white woman. So you’re sort of messed up all the way around. Agena: Yes! I felt more messed up watching this movie. It reinforced my own personal messed-up standards of physical beauty.

I’m back now and didn’t want to let any more time go by without reaching out. By now many of you have heard the news, and I’m sad to say it is true. I will not be returning to Hawaii Five-0 when production starts next week. Though I made myselfavailable to come back, CBS and I weren’t able to agree to terms on a new contract, so I made the difficult choice not to continue. As sad as it feels to say goodbye, what I feel most is gratitude. I am so deeply thankful to our crew, writers and everyone associated with the show – and especially the cast, who have been nothing but supportive through this entire process. They and the crew have been my second family for seven years and I wish them nothing but success for season 8 - and beyond.I also want to say to thank you to Peter Lenkov, Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci and everyone at CBS. I will always be grateful for their faith in me to bring Chin Ho Kelly to life. As an Asian American actor, I know first-hand how difficult it is to find opportunities at all, let alone play a well developed, three dimensional character like Chin Ho. I will miss him sincerely. What made him even more special is that he was a representative of a place my family and I so dearly love. It has been nothing short of an honor to be able to showcase the beauty and people of Hawaii every week, and I couldn’t be prouder to call these islands home. To my local community, mahalo nui loa.Finally, I want to thank all of you, the fans. I’ve read your messages and I can’t tell you how much they’ve meant to me. I never, ever forget that YOU are the reason Hawaii Five-0 is the success that it is, and interacting with you online and in person around the world(!) has been one of the greatest joys of this entire experience. I’m so sorry we won’t be continuing this journey together. I’ll end by saying that though transitions can be difficult, I encourage us all to look beyond the disappointment of this moment to the bigger picture. The path to equality is rarely easy. But I hope you can be excited for the future. I am. 5-0 continues on after one of its strongest seasons. I’ve got new acting projects on the horizon, and as a producer, my company, 3AD, has its first show, THE GOOD DOCTOR, set to air this fall on ABC. I hope you’ll tune in. There’s a lot to look forward to and I’ll be sure to share it with you. In the meantime, Aloha, thank you and Happy Independence Day!-DDK" True text

While we could not reach an agreement, we  part ways with tremendous respect for their talents on screen, as well  as their roles as ambassadors for the show off screen, and with hopes to  work with them again in the near future.” Kim lifted the veil on the dealmaking process with a Facebook post Wednesday  asserting  that he was not able to come to terms with CBS on a deal and that “the  path to equality is rarely easy.” It’s understood that Kim and Park  sought pay parity with the series’ lead actors, Alex O’Loughlin and  Scott Caan. The fact that Kim and Park are of Asian descent while  O’Loughlin and Caan are Caucasian added an inevitable racial component  to the situation at a time of heightened focus on diversity at all  levels of the entertainment industry. CBS executives were said to be  troubled by the suggestion from media coverage of Kim and Park’s  departures that race played a role in a business negotiation.Industry sources said O’Loughlin and Caan  are making about $200,000 per episode apiece for the upcoming eighth  season of the show, produced by CBS Television Studios. A source close  to the situation said CBS’ last per-episode salary offer to Kim was  about $5,000 apart from the two lead actors, and CBS offered to set a  new overall deal with Kim’s 3AD production banner. However, sources  close to Kim said the differential was more significant.The dispute on the difference in  compensation levels may hinge on the fact that O’Loughlin and Caan have a  small share of the backend profits of the show. “Hawaii Five-0”  commanded a lucrative $2 million-per-episode cable syndication deal with  TNT in 2011, although the show turned out to be a lackluster performer  for the cabler. It remains a successful property for CBS in  international markets — all of which means O’Loughlin and Caan’s profit  participation stakes probably plump up their take-home pay  considerably. Park, meanwhile, was said to have sought a  deal for less than half of a full season’s worth of episodes, which  would have been a financially challenging prospect for the network at  the salary that she sought. “Hawaii Five-0” delivered some 25 episodes  in its most recent season.Sources close to the situation noted that Kim and Park did not  negotiate as a unit in their discussions with CBS. The final offer for  Park was lower than that for Kim, according to a source.From Kim and Park’s perspective, it’s clear that the lack of pay  parity with O’Loughlin and Caan after seven seasons as central  characters was a deal-breaker. Kim is also revving up his activity as a  producer. His 3AD banner landed a new medical drama series on ABC for  the coming season, “The Good Doctor,” starring Freddie Highmore.From CBS’ perspective, Kim and Park remained supporting players and  there was a need to adhere, for precedent’s sake, to a traditional  differential between the job categories. The backend stakes that  O’Loughlin and Caan commanded reflect the leverage that the two actors  brought to the show when it was assembled in the 2009-2010 development  cycle.O’Loughlin and Caan have one more season to go on their contract with the show."

But whether that means we’ve seen the last of Park remains to be seen. “I don’t know as of right now,” the BSG alum said. “I did go talk to Peter Lenkov the other day, who is the showrunner, but it’s still undecided as to what’s going to happen.

And they really brought it for the 100th episode celebration at ATX Television Festival on Sunday.Original cast members Patrick J. Adams, Gabriel Macht, Meghan Markle, Rick Hoffman, Gina Torres, and Sarah Rafferty — along with creator Aaron Korsh, guests Abigail Spencer and Nick Wechsler, and the moderator, EW’s own Robyn Ross — came together for a lively table read of the pilot episode, but, in true Suits fashion, they didn’t exactly play it straight. The actors put on ridiculous accents and generally behaved about as playfully as you’d expect for a well-bonded cast that’s been together for seven seasons.“Sometimes work can feel like work, but this felt like play the whole time,” Adams said of shooting the pilot in 2011.Throughout the reading, the actors mocked one another (particularly Macht’s pronunciation of the word “harassment”) and shared surprise at various lines they’d forgotten.“I’m so nervous,” Markle admitted as she read the scene where Rachel tells Mike about her struggles with the LSAT. “Oh my god, I remember this. I think this is my audition scene.”“We had that group email the other day, and I was saying we’d all been to the same corporate housing so on top of working together, we were all living together,” Markle recalled. “Which makes a whole different dynamic, I think. It just became this family right out of the gate.”“That was really sweet,” Torres added. “There was an instant level of comfort and there was chemistry that’s only grown. When you have that, it’s safe to play, it’s safe to explore, it’s safe to take chances.”Watch the special 100th episode celebration montage, featuring several of the show’s signature one-liners, below.Later, at Rafferty’s urging, Markle showed off the adorable “Bewitched twitch” she can do with her nose.“This is like winning not only one lottery ticket, but three,” Hoffman said of the experience of celebrating 100 episodes. “All I have to say is thank you and I’ll never forget it.”But the chatter wasn’t only about looking back. The cast offered some clues about what to expect in season 7.When asked about that Darvey cliffhanger moment — where Donna told Harvey she wants more — Rafferty explained, “I think she meant everything everyone in this room is thinking she meant. … I think she’s in-process.”As for whether or not Torres will be returning to the series following her surprise appearance in the season 6 finale, the actress teased, “I wedged that door open on my way out.”Suits season 7 kicks off at 9 p.m. ET on July 12 on USA.
