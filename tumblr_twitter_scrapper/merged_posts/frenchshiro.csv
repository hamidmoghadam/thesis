frenchshiro 160891477798 "2017-05-21 01:00:24 GMT" http://frenchshiro.tumblr.com/post/160891477798/animation-primer-part-1-core-principles "askagamedev: I’ve been meaning to talk about how game animation works in general because it’s such an integral element to contemporary video games. Unfortunately, it’s also one of the broadest and deepest elements in entertainment today, which means that it’s very difficult to talk about any specifics without everyone involved understanding the fundamentals first. There’s a lot involved - animation in games is incredibly complicated, because it builds off of general animation principles (art), as well as technology (engineering), and is used in different ways in games (design). So, over the course of several posts, I’m going to try giving you all a primer on how game animation works. I’ll start from the most basic core principles (the twelve principles of animation), then move on to game-specific animation and how animators deal with it, and finally talk about how the animations work from an engineering perspective. That said… let’s begin. First off, let’s try to understand - what is animation? The best way I’ve heard it described is “Sculpting Time” - it’s a distinct means of showing something happening in four dimensions (length, width, depth, and time). A punch cannot exist in only two or three dimensions - it must take place over time. Our human brains are very good at taking separate pieces and putting them together into a coherent whole. When we see a whole bunch of distinct, individual images in close proximity to each other, our brains will stitch them together to a single action. That subconscious mental stitching is the foundation of animation. As artists figured out how this worked, they experimented and discovered ways to make animation look better. Animators took their traditional drawings and experimented with bending and breaking rules, inventing techniques like “smearing” - exaggerating characters in individual frames in order to make the overall motion look smoother - in the process. This is why freeze frames of old Disney animated movies are often so weird looking - they are masters of using this technique. Generally, a “good looking” animation is one that reads well to the viewer - all animation is constructed for the benefit of the viewer more than anything else. As such, it means that the motion has to convey a story to the viewer. Good animation will convey a clearer story to the viewer than bad, and that translates to “looking better”. The animation pioneers’ wisdom was essentially boiled down to twelve fundamental principles. Today, I’ll go over the twelve principles. All images taken from @the12principles. The Twelve Principles of Animation 1. Squash and Stretch. When creatures move, they don’t just move parts of their body through space. There’s a give and take involved, where parts of the body will flatten more and others will stretch further - muscles elongate and contract, bones and joints will change position, and so on and so forth. This doesn’t only apply to living things either - inanimate objects like balls, water droplets, and other things will also change shape as force is applied to it. A baseball hit by a bat is most definitely not round at the point of impact. Humans understand this on a subconscious level, and are keyed to look for it. Seeing bodies contract and expand makes the viewer feel like the motion is more palpable.  2. Anticipation. Humans subconsciously look for clues for something to happen, even if it happens only a fraction of a second before it. By showing the viewers something to clue them in as to what is about to happen, it primes them for when the action actually does happen. Without it, it can feel like the action came out of nowhere. By giving a moment’s notice, the action is conveyed more clearly. 3. Staging. Staging is about clarity of intention. You want the viewer to understand what feeling or emotion is being conveyed by the animated object at all times, and it should be clear through the motion exactly what that feeling is. By providing clarity of feeling, the viewer subconsciously relates better to the moving object. 4. Pose to Pose. This is the idea of having several key poses for the moving object, and then filling in images for what happens in between those key poses. This is a natural extension of computers’ ability to interpolate between numbers and figure out what happens “in between” at a specific time step between two numbers. There is another method of doing this called “Straight Ahead” where the animator creates images from frame to frame without a clear goal of where to end up and that lends itself better to things like morphing shapes or visual effects like fire burning, explosions, water splashing, etc.  5. Follow Through. Action can’t exist in a vacuum. Similar to Anticipation above, Follow Through means that the movement doesn’t just stop. It continues moving because it has weight, and thus has a result. Our brains are primed to look for this. Stuff that just stops moving all of a sudden feel abnormal to the viewer. By allowing the viewer to see the results of the motion, it feels more real.  6. Slow In and Slow Out. This principle means that our brains are primed to see things start slow, end slow, and do most of the movement in between. Slow In and Slow Out is similar to Anticipation and Follow Through but at an even more basic level. It only refers to the speed of the movements at these crucial end points, but it smooths out the transition and helps our subconscious brain because it’s primed to think about things in terms of weight and inertia - we expect things to slide to a stop, we expect things to require more effort to start, and we expect gravity to play a part. 7. Arcs. Circles and arcing motion are pleasant to the human eye. When we move, we tend to move in arcs, rather than straight lines. When we walk, our heads naturally bob and dip, creating an arc. When we gesture, our arms usually move in a circular motion, rather than a straight line. When we speak, we subconsciously adjust for a natural cadence in our voices, rather than maintain a constant monotone. Humans like arcs. In animation, we subconsciously want to see them. 8. Secondary Action. Secondary Action is similar to Follow Through above where we expect to see the results of the motion. Nothing moves alone in a vacuum, after all. This means that the stuff that the moving thing may be touching or interact with should also show effects from that movement. An object on a table might get jostled when the table is bumped, yelling at someone might cause the listener to wince, or firing a gun would cause recoil in the arms of the person firing it. It’s important to incorporate secondary action into motions to make them more believable. 9. Timing. Timing affects how we perceive things to be by watching them move. Observe the two actions animated above. What does this tell you about the big cube that the smaller cubes are pushing? Perhaps the bottom big cube is heavier and requires more effort than the top one? Maybe the top one is on a floor that’s easier to slide things on than the bottom? See how just the timing of the motion affects your perception of it. 10. Exaggeration. We tend to lose a lot of the nuance of natural motion, especially when viewed at a distance. When creating an experience for a viewer, we don’t want to take that risk… so the best way to make sure that the viewer doesn’t miss it is to exaggerate its motion. Arcs become bigger, timing becomes tighter, secondary motions become more elaborate. This helps them read better to the viewer. It might feel like making the motions obvious would be a little hamfisted to the viewer, but it’s actually very useful. 11. Solid Drawing. Solid Drawing means to take the principles of perspective and weight into account when creating the moving object. When an object of a certain size and shape moves, viewers will assume certain characteristics like inertia, weight, and so on. Animation does not inherently carry these sorts of constraints, but the wise animator will still take them into account when creating those motions. An enormous object should treated as if it were heavy. A thin object might bend, flex, or shatter. A round object might roll. A fragile object can break. 12. Appeal. This is kind of tough to describe, but Appeal basically refers to the character being interesting and memorable to look at. Something about the character stands out in your mind and you have a generally good reaction towards it. You should be able to recall the character from memory. Even villains have Appeal - Ganondorf and Ganon are extremely memorable visually, even if they aren’t heroes. But Megatron from Michael Bay’s Transformers movies has too much detail clutter and obfuscates what visually defines him. If you’ve seen the movies, can you remember any sort of visual distinction about him? Could you choose him out of a silhouette? That’s what happens when Appeal is missing. If you’re observant, you’ll see that actual real-life motion often incorporates these principles in general. These aren’t just suggestions for making animation look better, but an understanding of all of the little details that go into motion in order to make it look believable.  Further Reading: [Art Eater’s blog post on the 12 principles of Animation using Darkstalkers as an example]Next time, we will go over how 3D animators actually deal with making things move.

I feel like what makes the difference between something being romantic and something being What Society Says Is Romance is the connection between people.  Let’s say two people arrive on my doorstep. One of them has a bouquet of expensive roses from the florist. The other one has a dead bird in a plastic bag. We all know which one is to be considered the romantic gift (hint: it’s not the corpse)  And it’s not like I don’t like flowers or am allergic or anything, I would probably be flattered. But I have no connection to roses, and like, you can give roses to more or less anyone Dead birds are not a standard gift, for pretty obvious reasons. A person bringing me a corpse in a plastic bag had to know me well enough to know that I collect bones and process them myself, and you don’t go shopping for birds in the Dead Bird Shop around the corner, so that means this person didn’t go out with the intent of getting me something and came back with an Appropriate Gift, they probably stumbled across something and thought about me (this ‘something’ just so happens to be a dead bird, because I’m weird) And then they had to go through the process of picking this bird up and bagging it and bringing it to me, probably pretty spontaneously and without a calendar event that says Find Dead Bird For Raptor with a timeslot between three and four pm. You can’t have Corpse I Found In a Ditch be romantic without some sort of connection here. Roses can be romantic, but it can also just, be a formula. Two plos Two Equals Romance. A shortcut for ‘I care about you‘, even though the person might …. not, actually.  If it’s someone who loves fresh flowers in their home but rarely has the money to buy large arrangements, or like OP’s example where person A gets the chocolates because they know their s.o. thinks the boxes are super cute, then we have Standard Romantic Actions actually be romantic, but they might as well not be. This is where my squad has the joke of someone posting a picture of a dead rat to the skype chat and goes ‘Raptor I saw this and thought of you‘ and I go -exaggerated gasping noise- “how dare you blatantly flirt with me right in front of my girlfriend“ from (and also THIS JOKE that bunch of people were confused about). Because there’s INTEREST and CONNECTION there. They’re obviosuly not actually trying to steal me from my gf, but there is a human connection and a knowledge of who I am and what I want to be associated with. The humor then comes in from the self-awareness that this could very much be the opposite of a compliment in, like, probably most other situations ever. So TL;DR: Things can’t be romantic without the connection between people, no matter how ‘inherit‘ people claim the gesture is. However, more or less anything can be a romantic gesture if there’s the right connection and consideration behind it. Taking out the trash can be romantic. Bringing home a dead fox can be romantic. There’s no Romance Shortcuts. You have to actually care about the other person (sorry, Writers Of Like 9 Out Of 10 Mainstream Movies), there’s no way around it. So basically: Care about each other!! If you’re writing, write characters who care about each other!! And if you don’t know what character A could do for character B, you might wanna look into whether or not you’ve made a Cardboard Love Interest, like I feel many mainstream writers do. But that’s a whooooole ‘nother can of worms.  There’s so many cans of worms.  Oh god there’s so many worms. Please help.  I’ve wondered for a long time why so many fictional romances feel forced and this is the exact reason. So many main couples in media only express their love through performative romance. This is also why a lot of platonic fictional relationships are seen as romantic because for some reason screenwriters have a habit of making friends express their love for each other with actual thought and intent to their actions.

I understand if u want to be rude to the Mink fans that are apologists and don’t acknowledge what he did but why are you picking on the people who understand and don’t support his actions??? Why are you calling them rape apologists when they don’t excuse his actions? Why are you saying racist things to them??? Why are you sending them hate messages about how they should die??? What’s wrong with you people??? Do you think you’re doing any good??? By making somebody want to kill themselves??? Do you think that since you don’t like Mink you’re gods perfect angel fave and therefore have the right to be scum and send hate?? EVERYONE has a problematic fave. Did u know that??? You know why people have problematic faves????? Because it’s interesting! It leaves the possibility of character development! It makes humans feel better about themselves! Just like u shitting on mink fans makes u feel better about yourself! And last of all, this is a fucking game. It’s not real. People have different attitudes towards real people and fictional characters! Surprise!!! Just because someone likes Mink doesn’t mean that they support every rapist in the real world!! It’s a simple concept! Listen, and you better fucking read this all before you argue about this with me, dmmd is a game and NO just because it’s a game doesn’t mean that what happened to Aoba is okay and it doesn’t invalidate people’s feelings about it either and you can be upset about it but THE PEOPLE WHO PLAY DMMD ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAPPENED IN THE GAME. THEY DID NOT MAKE THE GAME. IF YOU DO NOT LIKE THE GAME DO NOT ASSOCIATE YOURSELF WITH IT OR BOTHER THE PEOPLE WHO DO. JUST ERASE THE NEGATIVITY IN YOUR LIFE.

Yes, he loves Aoba more than anyone else in this world. And, when you love someone that deeply, and have that long and that profound a history with that person… if they fall in love with someone else, and are happy with that person… you’ll step back, and let them enjoy that happiness, no matter how much it hurts. You’ll back them up and support them like you always have, because they’re your best friend, and their happiness is most important to you, even if it’s not a happiness you can give them. So, you support your friend as he sets out into a new relationship with a new lover but you still hang out and you laugh and talk about silly things. And your friend is laughing and smiling and talking about silly things too, and even if your heart is breaking inside from knowing it isn’t you who’s making him happy, you are… kind of glad. Because, you can always be by his side, even if it’s not in the way you want to be. And, you know, probably you’re gonna be sad and bitter and depressed when no one’s looking. You’ll hide in your house alone and look at a photo of the two of you from back when there had been a chance, a snowball’s chance in hell if only you’d spoken up or realized it earlier or confessed but you didn’t and he’s not yours now. But, you know that now you have no right to. No room to. No place to. That road is closed to you and you would never ruin your friend’s happiness this way, not now. You don’t have that right, you feel. And, yeah, it’s shitty, but time passes. And, you  watch your friend’s relationship blossom into something deep and profound, but you know that your friendship is also something deep and profound in an entirely different way. You love your friend with all your heart, but you start to realize it’s not that kind of love. All those times you’ve sat and reminded yourself, it’s not your place to love him like that worked. You still love him, but in the way you would love a brother. And he loves you in the same way. And, you realize, that’s okay. That kind of love is okay. You’re not the soulmates you thought you’d be. But you’re a different kind of soulmates and at the end of it, you’re still by each other side, and he’s happy, and when he looks over at you with a smile and says, you’re a fucking hippo, Koujaku, you know that it was worth it… because his happiness is the most precious thing in the world.
