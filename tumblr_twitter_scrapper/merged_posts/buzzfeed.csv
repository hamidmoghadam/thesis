It was too thick to effectively circulate through the body, but Alice Ball, science prodigy and chemist extraordinaire, was the one who FINALLY figured how to turn it into a working treatment. It’s thanks to her that a leprosy crisis was avoided in the early 1900s. Bless you, Alice.Stay with me for a second because this is actual rocket science. Centaur is a second-stage rocket launcher: the workhorse of the rocket world used to propel countless probes and satellites into space. It’s been invaluable to NASA since its creation, first allowing the U.S. to catch up to the Soviet Union during the space race, and eventually propelling spacecrafts to land on the moon and fly by other planets in the solar system.So yes: Annie Easley helped DO that. She also contributed energy research to power plants and electronic batteries, which enabled the creation of hybrid vehicles. Go ahead and thank Annie for those, too.Prior to Jeanne, the impact of discrimination and its accompanying stress factors were rarely explored or acknowledged in relationship to health. She also researched the impact of racism on childhood development and ways to approach therapy that addressed the needs of people of color. And Jeanne broke a ton of ground for black psychologists through her roles in academia and her publications.Jewel researched ways to alter cell growth AND experimented with growing human tumor tissue outside of the human body to use for cancer treatment tests (instead of testing on living people). As if that wasn’t enough, she also helped to form the National Science Foundation’s Committee on Women and Minorities in Science.The chair of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission monitors the byproduct of nuclear reactors, so it’s a pretty big deal. Shirley also served on a bunch of advisory boards for international security and energy, AND she was the first black woman to get a Ph.D from MIT.

Chuck Schumer, the Senate Minority Leader, said, ""That is an absurd and obscene statement.”The Anti-Defamation League also questioned Trump’s reported remarks.“We are astonished by what the President reportedly said. It is incumbent upon the White House to immediately clarify these remarks. In light of the ongoing attacks on the Jewish community, it is also incumbent upon the President to lay out in his speech tonight his plans for what the federal government will do to address this rash of anti-Semitic incidents,” Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of ADL, said in a statement.

We are used to being arrested or have cases filed against us, but blocking us is a new thing.” Mada Masr, since its founding in 2013, has regularly published critical stories of the regime in both English and Arabic.The blocking of the websites comes one day after the arrest of prominent human rights lawyer Khaled Ali, who had announced his intent to run as a candidate against President Abdel Fatah el-Sisi in the 2018 presidential elections. Authorities in Egypt have targeted activists from Ali’s Aish We Horreiya — “Bread and Liberty” — party, and arrested at least 36 people in 17 cities throughout the country from five opposition parties and political youth groups. Many of the arrested have been accused them of insulting Sisi on social media platforms." True link

If nothing else, the alt-right is all about division: between nations, between races, between genders, between religions, between ideologies, and between trolls and non-trolls. “[The title] is almost daring people to divide the work,” said Ben Davis, the national art critic for artnet News. “From an art point of view, it was the point of the project, I assume.”The artists strenuously claim the piece is nonpartisan, and that the words can be, per the introductory text, “a show of resistance or insistence, opposition or optimism, guided by the spirit of each individual participant and the community.” But the media immediately reported the work as an anti-Trump protest, and it’s sort of hard to blame them: “He Will Not Divide Us” appeared the day of the inauguration, in New York City, where Hillary Clinton won nearly 80% of the vote, at the same time as protests against Trump massed in cities throughout the world. Realistically, who was going to be chanting those words?If the event was alt-right catnip in theory, in practice it was irresistible. The footage from the first day is an unintentional masterpiece of Bannonian propaganda: A rich, white, half-Jewish, hip, liberal movie star (and his black, second-generation movie star friend) leading an ethnically mixed crowd in a piece of performance art that doubled at times as an anti-Trump demonstration, at a New York City museum whose board includes Jeff Zucker, Jeffrey Katzenberg, a labor union leader, and a hedge fund founder.“It feeds into the right-wing narrative about coastal elites and Hollywood liberals, Meryl Streep versus Trump,” Davis said.Perhaps most provocatively, as far as the alt-right is concerned, “He Will Not Divide Us” was participatory and livestreamed. Threads announcing the project appeared on 4chan’s /pol/ forum and other alt-right online communities within hours of the stream going live.Continue reading." True link

Her gliding intonation and dulcet tone are as soothing as the comfort-food reality TV shows which she narrates.Since 2009, Dunker has voiced literally thousands of episodes of the House Hunters franchise, becoming an integral part of the HGTV juggernaut, which drew almost 25 million primetime viewers each month last year.While the buyers and cities may change, the narrator does not. Episode after episode, Dunker introduces us to a new couple and a new location but with the same sing-song intonation and honeyed tone. She is the show.Yet, she hasn’t been seen on camera on the network, not even once.On a channel brimming with handsome homebuilders and homespun husband-and-wife property stars, the woman who gives voice to some of the network’s most popular and obsessively-watched shows stands apart — unlike the others, she is heard but not seen, HGTV’s most famous unfamous person.“I’ve remained in the shadows,” Dunker told BuzzFeed News. “The conventional wisdom for voiceover actors is you are kind of heard and not seen. It’s just kind of the way it’s always been.”And she’s never given an extensive interview before — until now." True link

It follows the broad strokes of the House’s American Health Care Act.The Senate bill is more moderate than the House bill in some ways. While both bills offer some subsidies to help people pay for insurance, the House bill did not take income into account, instead basing the subsidies on age, opening the door to major premium hikes for people with lower incomes.The Senate bill, however, ties the credits to income, as Obamacare did. This should help mitigate the premium spikes projected in the House bill, which could have led to some low-income elderly people facing an almost 10-fold increase in out-of-pocket costs.The Senate bill could cause a hikes in out-of-pocket costs for people who rely on the tax credit subsidies. Under Obamacare, insurance companies had to offer plans that covered 70% of a person’s total health care costs to be eligible for subsidies. Under the Senate bill, that would fall to 58%. In other words, out-of-pocket costs for people who rely on subsidies would rise by one-third." True link

He was 42.Celebrated for their gripping, noir tales of extralegal exploits in their native Queens, Mobb Deep helped define hip-hop’s first golden age in New York in the mid ‘90s with their 1995 album The Infamous. Its most famous single, the eerie and flinty-eyed “Shook Ones, Pt. II,” introduced a slang alternative to the past tense of “shake” that has endured in popular vernacular.“It is with extreme sadness and disbelief that we confirm the death of our dear friend Albert Johnson, better known to millions of fans as Prodigy of legendary NY rap duo Mobb Deep,” a statement from Prodigy’s publicist read. “Prodigy was hospitalized a few days ago in Las Vegas after a Mobb Deep performance for complications caused by a sickle cell anemia crisis. As most of his fans know, Prodigy battled the disease since birth.”" True link

Ten people were wounded.One person died at the scene, but the Metropolitan police say he was being given first aid before the attack and it’s not clear whether he died as a result of it.Witnesses said the assailant yelled out that he wanted to “kill all Muslims”.When the van came to a stop after hitting a bollard, witnesses told BuzzFeed News the driver got out and was tackled by three men, who held him down until police arrived and arrested him.Theresa May, the prime minister, said the attack was a terrorist act “every bit as sickening” as other recent incidents.Videos from the scene show people sprawled on the pavement and being attended to by paramedics.A man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. The Met described the incident as a terror attack.London mayor Sadiq Khan called it a “horrific terrorist attack on innocent people”.The driver apparently targeted a group of people who had gathered around an older man who fell, perhaps because of heat exhaustion.This is a developing story."
