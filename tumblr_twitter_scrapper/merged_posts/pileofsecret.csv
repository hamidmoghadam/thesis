Change of url may also happen.Goal: Preparing the site to showcase my own artwork and progress. As well as creating a point of contact to  art streams and commission info among other things. In its current state, the blog sort of serves as an artwork inspiration and aesthetic blog. The original intent was to be both inspiration and my own artwork but that didn’t work out as we can see. I plan on creating a separate blog for inspiration and artwork that isn’t mine. A similar thing happened a year or two ago when I decided to create a separate shitposting/general reblog blog. Once the adjustments to design are implemented, and my artwork is uploaded, I’ll be creating a blog to move all unrelated posts currently on this blog to the new one.Updates on other social media: Instagram: TOTALLY CHECK OUT MY INSTAGRAM. Twitter: I do have a twitter that I shoooould post more on however I just haven’t had the ability to invest into it.Youtube: Will be uploading paintings and video updates on occasion, but currently not in the position to really delve more into what I plan on doing with that. Gotta get other stuff settled first, one step at a time." True text

Open casket and everything. This is hilarious, yeah, but reading Matt Furie’s explanation is weirdly heartbreaking. He’s clearly emotionally invested in Pepe and finds him a meaningful expression of himself…   “The characters in ‘Boy’s Club’ will always be a part of me. Andy the wise guy, Landwolf the party animal, Brett the fashionable dancer, and Pepe the chill frog — they are all tweaked reflections of my own values and sensibilities. Their personalities unfolded and blossomed as time went on, but just like the person in your life that you love the most, one day they will die. And death can be as beautiful as life, because it’s what makes life important.” damn dude I’m sorry the Internet turned your stoner frog son evil  sorry for the poor image quality - i’m standing in my bedroom photographing this strip from my phone! even though it’s very tongue-in-cheek i have a hard time laughing at it… i guess because it’s every (decent) creator’s nightmare that something that represents a part of them will get turned into some kind of hate symbol this is a compilation i picked up for free comics day - and i did it because furie was listed on the cover. he seems like a really nice guy. it’s worth noting before this, he tried his best to “reclaim” pepe, soliciting positive, non-nazi-affiliated drawings of him from anyone on the internet who wanted to submit one. but i think the symbolism has gotten away from him at this point, and he probably feels he can’t erase the baggage that has been attached to it. it’s a huge bummer and i feel bad for him " False text

Drawing B to Drawing C: -Most obvious change is to zoom in on the character.  Character framing is just as important as what the character is doing.  Zooming in can help infensify emotions.  this shot is ALL about this character and what they’re feeling.-Because of the zooming in, the arms/hands would have gotten lost, so instead of making the canvas wider, the artist has elected to rotate the character slightly, bringing a dynamic angle to things and more intensity to the close shot.-While the character is more upright in this shot compared to Drawing B, in Drawing C the chest still slightly overlaps the neck, preserving the feeling of being slightly below the character (putting them in a position of power relative to the viewer), which helps maintain confidence and power in the character.-the chest is exaggerated to carry the majority of the body’s line of action so even though you cannot see the legs, our brains are able to fill in the gap and envision that line of action.-The cropping/framing of the character allows for a more interesting composition/negative shapes created by the positive (character) on the negative (background), creating more visual interest as well as a circular motion to the composition through the arms, across the face to the negative space for the eyes to rest in before dropping to the hand in the background and back through the composition again.

When I was in the hole and needed money for college, not a SINGLE person from tumblr or deviantART ordered a commission. Sometimes people would ask about prices and reply, “Oh, nevermind, that’s too expensive.” I felt miserable. In a fit of desperation, I brushed off my old Furaffinity account and revamped it. It was full of old, outdated bullshit and still had my “Taco pancakes!!! XDDD” aesthetic embedded in the info box. I had a lot of work to do. When I was done, I started following and talking to people, I made an art shop, I started posting things and providing commission info.  Within a few weeks, I had my first customer. After a month, I had a full queue of commissions lined up to go. I have $250 in my PayPal wallet left after paying for my textbooks and part of my tuition – and I’m still getting more business!  And you know what my most common comment was? “Your art really should cost more.” These were often followed by $10-20 tips. I was fucking flabbergasted. So yeah, go ahead and make fun of furries. Undermine the hours of work that goes into their art and fursuits.
