He could be shy or just not used to the camera, but when you top that with the fact his voice doesn’t waver and he doesn’t lose his focus, it’s probably just bad posture.” “Yes, I’d say it’s just bad posture. All other signs indicate he’s not shy at all- very confident in himself.” (2010) “He’s changed, but I’m not sure how.” (remember, she’s still new to this study and she doesn’t know Dan and Phil’s story) “Has he got a girlfriend or a boyfriend now? That’s the first conclusion I can come to, he looks much more joyful somehow. A new addition to the family, like a sibling or a partner can give him that sort of look. I’ve studied that plenty of times.” (2012) “See, if that was a partner back then I’d say they broke up now. He’s losing his focus on the camera and he’s playing with his hands more. Definitely nervous about something.” “He’s lost that glint in his eyes. I’m sure you can see that too, right? There’s no terminology, he just seems less… excited?“   (2015) “He’s very confident in himself, if you look at his open body language.” “-but when he speaks of other people he folds his hands and hunches his shoulders slightly. This could indicate nervousness around new people or a fear of being ignored.” “He’s very passionate about his job and life, yes?” “I’d say he’s definitely over whatever happened a few years back and is even happier than that insane mood boost” (in 2010)  DURING JUST DAN VIDEOS: (2012) “He’s a bit self-conscious, you see, but it could just be general shyness.” “He looks kind of awkward here (Dan was in public at the time). Fear of public places or crowds?” “He almost seems defensive or angry about something, he looks very defiant.”  (2014) “He’s definitely become more confident, his posture has improved greatly and he seems happier.” “He’s got a twinkle in his eye, I bet even you can see it. He looks quite proud of himself.” (2015) “He looks generally happier and that proud look isn’t gone. Sometimes this indicates a big event has happened, something good.” “Now, what my professor has told us is when someone gets out of boughs of depression or anxiety this quickly it’s because of some sort of sudden event. We’ve studied cases where a particular person(s) has even helped, whether on purpose or not.”  WATCHING DAN AND PHIL VIDEOS:  “There’s definitely some sort of admiration or ‘love-struck’ sort of look in the brown-haired guy’s eyes.” “They aren’t dating? They’re incredibly close friends than, yes?” “He (Dan) appears to be slightly awkward but is most likely close/safe feeling around the other one. That usually takes time if he’s shy.” “How long have they been friends? It must be long, they appear to have a strong connection.”   OVERALL:  Dan and Phil have had a strong emotional impact on each other, and whether they are dating or not, they are incredibly close. I’d like to thank my friend, Emily, for submitting to my experiment due to the fact she is studying Human Body Language at college/Uni. " False text

Looking at the lyrics from Bangtan’s officially released Korean songs where either all members sing/rap or the vocal line sings the following are how many lines Jin got per song. No More Dream: 2 We Are Bulletproof pt 2: 6, 2 of which are shared with Hoseok I Like It: 7 N.O: 3 If I Ruled The World: 6, which are the same thing repeated each time Coffee: 5 Rise of Bangtan: 6, all of them shared with Jimin Outro Luv in Skool (vocal line only): 2 Boy In Luv: 8 and “say what you want” 10 times Where Did You Come From: 8, repeating the same 4 lines twice Just One Day: 3 Tomorrow: 6, repeating the same 3 lines twice Spine Breaker: 2, the same line twice Jump: 3, same lines repeated Outro Propose (vocal line only): 4 Miss Right: 8, same lines repeated Danger: 6, same lines repeated War of Hormones: 3 plus the hello hello, tell me what you want right now Hip Hop Lover: 6 Let Me KNow: 8, 6 of which are just girl let me know Rain: 2 Can You Turn Off Your Phone: 4 Blanket Kick: 4 24/7=heaven: 7 Look here: 2 Second Grade: 6, same 3 lines repeated twice Outro Does That Make Sense: 3 I Need U: 5 Hold Me Tight: 5 Dope: 4 Fun Boys: 5 Converse High: 4 Move: 9  Run: 7 Butterfly: 4, which were all bullshit lines like “untrue” Whalien 52: 5 Ma City: 9 Baebae: I can’t even consider the lines they gave him lines so I’ll say 0 Dead Leaves: 8, 2 of them shared House of Cards: 5 Fire: 5, 2 of them shared Save Me: 6 Forever Young: 4 Blood Sweat Tears: 4 and all of them shared AND you can’t even hear him Lost: 12 (groundbreaking tbh) Am I Wrong: 6, all shared 21 Century Girls: 2 Interlude Wings: 2 All-in-all that’s 251 lines in 48 songs over the course of THREE FUCKING YEARS. To give a little perspective: it takes Jin about 5-6 songs to get as many lines as Jeongguk does in 1. I understand that Jeongguk is the main vocalist but that still doesn’t mean Jin should get so few lines.Try and tell me that that isn’t unfair to him. And for those of you that want to say that Jin doesn’t deserve lines because his voice is ugly: JIN CAN SINGHe even wrote an entire song about wishing that he could be as good as the others…that’s heartbreaking.  Please love and support Jin, he’s so so important to Bangtan and he deserves as much love and respect as all the other members.  " False text

don’t speak korean. good music is just half the appeal. because some of these lyrics are literally so powerful i’m crying.  reflection is about struggling with your identity and learning to love yourself, with all your good qualities and all your flaws. it’s about dealing with insecurity and emptiness and loneliness. it’s about feeling like no one loves you and that you’re not as good as everyone else and how you get so hard on yourself because of it. ‘why are you not good enough?’ it’s about reflecting on those feelings of self-hatred and insecurity and trying to overcome them. 21st century girl is about the double-standards and criticism many girls face in our modern society. it’s a cry for strength and self-love. it’s a message that it’s ok to say ‘fuck you’ to the world for trying to force you into someone you’re not.  mama is about a mother’s sacrifice and growing up, telling her “it’s okay, i’ve grown and now you can lean on me.” it’s about the raw relationship between a struggling mother and her child. and realizing your mother’s sacrifice as you grow up. awake is about seeing your limits and feeling imperfect and ‘not enough’ but trying anyway. it’s about knowing you can’t fly but reaching out toward the sky anyway.  two! three! hope for more good days is about endurance. they’re saying ‘no, i’m not going to lie and tell you everything will be fine because it’s not. but you have me.’ it’s about enduring those hardships with those that mean a lot to you whether it’s a relationship between bts and armys/a group of friends/family it essentially says to find strength in those you love. to share your burdens and see the darkness through together.  cypher (part 4) is about not giving a fuck about haters or anyone trying to bring you down. it’s about realizing that the noise they make is just that…noise. it’s about loving yourself and learning not to care about what anyone says or thinks about you. wings (interlude) is about reaching for the sky (metaphorically). it’s about embracing your inner child, your immaturity, and your stupidity sometimes to take risks. because sometimes you need to find your inner psycho to realize your dreams and find yourself. you need to find your ‘wings’ to fly.  first love is about something, a passion, a talent, that you’ve had since you were young that you neglected for a while, but that’s always there for you. it’s your escape. your safe place. suga talks about his first love being his piano, or his love for words and channeling his emotions into music. me personally, i love writing, and though i don’t have as much time to write as i used to, whenever i pick up my pen again it feels so good and satisfying i want to cry blood, sweat & tears is about being so intoxicated with your own feelings you neglect yourself in the process. it’s about being ‘high’ on love and the desires & needs that come along with it. it’s about tearing yourself down and giving everything to someone- essentially pouring your blood, sweat, and tears into them, and how that can develop into a toxic relationship. it’s a raw song about lust, love, and foolishness. boy meets evil is also about intoxication. it’s about encountering ‘evil’ as your grow up and discovering feelings like greed, ambition, and lust. they’re essentially talking about realizing parts of you that you know are ‘evil’ but being so in love with the rush they give you that you refuse to give them up. once again, this concept of being high and the rush that comes along with it.  lie is about being caught in a lie (yes i’m sure you already guessed from the title). it’s about lying to yourself and giving in to the lies of others, and losing yourself in the process. it’s about that feeling of being trapped in these lies because you don’t know how to get the truth out. it’s about realizing how cruel the world is for trapping you and after realizing that, you feel like you ‘lost your innocence’  stigma is about hiding your identity. it’s about lying to yourself and to the world and the feeling that comes along with it- of being dirty, disgraceful, a sinner. it’s about struggling with your identity and ‘confessing your sins’ to the world to beg for forgiveness. it’s about covering your scars but feeling like the world can see each and every one anyway- and that you deserve to be to punished for it. begin is about the people that love you and support you. it’s about those that offered their shoulder for you to cry on. those that have been your wall of strength and wanting to return the favor. it’s about acknowledging how they helped you overcome your ‘emptiness’ and realizing that you want to do anything to show how grateful you are, to be there for them too.  am i wrong is about going insane. it’s about feeling like the world has gone crazy and you’re the only sane one. it’s that feeling when your head feels like it’s about to explode. when you say something (i.e feel indifferent to the news, or disagree with someone) and suddenly everyone wants to hold a knife to your throat for it. you feel like you’ve lost it, that you’re going crazy yourself.  and finally, my personal favorite: lost is about losing yourself. it’s about being so utterly lost and feeling like you’re faced with so many different ways to go and paths to take. it’s about not knowing what to do or where to go. it’s essentially that feeling you get, not as you’re growing up, but as you’re become conscious of the fact that you’re growing up. it’s about realizing that even though you don’t know which path to take, you know that you’ll stick to your own path. what really struck me is this one line ‘you need to lose your way to find your way.’ you need to be lost, hopeless, and confused to find yourself and find the path you want to take. i feel like this is something everyone goes through, and i started crying when i read the lyrics honestly.  so don’t you see? yes, it’s great that the album sounds great, but it’s absolutely amazing how each song has such a powerful message that relates to the overall theme of growing up and ‘finding your wings’. their words are so powerful and relatable and more than ever, i feel like bts is summing up all their feelings: all the joy and all the anxiety and all the confusion that comes with growing up and coming to terms it. it’s about learning to bridge your childhood and adulthood. learning to embrace and love your maturity and your immaturity. if you actually take the time to understand what they’re saying, you might find the words you didn’t know you needed to hear. i know i did.  " False text
