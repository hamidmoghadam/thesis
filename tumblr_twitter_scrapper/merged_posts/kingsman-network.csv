Which pretty much sold the film to me, after all who wouldn’t want to see that?  Then I laid eyes on Harry Hart and I kind of fell in love with him (and I went from being a Colin Firth fan to pretty much a Colin Firth obsessive for which I blame Matthew Vaughn entirely. Especially because it’s meant I have watched some awful movies over the past 12 months just for Colin that weren’t Kingsman). What’s not to love about a secret agent who carries an umbrella, insults Michael Caine to his face, beats up people just because he’s had a rather emotional day, clearly loves musicals, has lots of fun with poisonous fountain pens, enjoys McDonald’s with super villians and keeps a stuffed dog.

For example, Marvel announced that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 had been given the go-ahead a few days before the second film had even premiered. Fans of the Kingsman franchis should rejoice, because it looks like the Matthew Vaughn movies will be getting a similar treatment. While the second installment, Kingsman: The Golden Circle, doesn’t hit theaters until the fall, Matthew Vaughn has already begun working on number three.At a Fox premiere event in London, Vaughn treated those in attendance to a screening of The Golden Circle’s first act. After debuting the footage, which was received extremely well, the director talked a bit about the franchise.At one point, Vaughn revealed that there was definitely a third movie being planned. He started the plans way back when he was still writing the second movie. He claimed that the third Kingsman would tell a surprising story, and that “no one will predict where Eggsy winds up.”Kingsman: The Golden Circle arrives in theaters on September 29, 2017.The film is being directed by Matthew Vaughn. The script was co-written by Vaughn and Jane Goldman, based on the “The Secret Service” comic book created by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons. It is produced by Vaughn, David Reid, and Adam Bohling.The cast features Colin Firth, Julianne Moore, Taron Egerton, Mark Strong, Halle Berry, Sir Elton John, Channing Tatum, and Jeff Bridges."

You don’t have to sit through a James Bond movie until the credits roll to realise that gritty realism is hardly the order of the day. If there’s one thing that’s certain to have us scoffing at our screens in disbelief, though, it’s not the sight of our favourite secret agent leaping from a moving car, hanging out of a helicopter, or disposing of incompetent henchmen in a hollowed-out volcano. No, it’s the fact that he’s doing it while wearing a suit, shirt and tie – and yet not once does he reach for a handkerchief to mop his brow.The latest Kingsman collection, which is available now on MR PORTER, pays homage not just to the inimitable style of the gentleman spy, but also to his seemingly miraculous ability to stay cool whatever the circumstances. It features double-breasted suits – a signature Kingsman silhouette – that come partially lined, feature only lightly padded shoulders and are cut from tropical-weight fabrics, which makes them a far breezier proposition than a fully lined suit. The lack of internal structure also allows the fabric to drape naturally from the shoulders, ensuring a softer, more relaxed silhouette.New arrivals also include a single-breasted, cotton-twill suit in a rich shade of toffee-brown, a double-breasted suit in slub linen and a black barathea tuxedo with a self-facing shawl lapel, a departure from previous Kingsman collections, which have featured tuxedos with lapels cut from a contrasting fabric, such as satin or grosgrain silk. Elsewhere, there are nods to the now well-established motifs of the Kingsman brand. Suits are cut from traditional British fabrics sourced from heritage mills – expect pinstripe wools from Halstead and Prince of Wales checks from Dormeuil.None of this is guaranteed to keep you cool in the midst of a firefight. Kingsman has never been about that. The original collection may have taken inspiration from the world of the on-screen spy – it was originally launched as a costume wardrobe for Mr Matthew Vaughn’s hugely successful 2014 spy movie Kingsman: The Secret Service – but it was designed, first and foremost, to meet the real-world needs of the modern gentleman. Don’t expect your new pair of Kingsman shoes to come fitted with a retractable blade hidden inside the toe, then, or your suit to be fitted with a bullet-proof lining. Just expect exceptional clothes, made exceptionally well.This is the brand’s sixth collection, and the last before the movie’s sequel, Kingsman: The Golden Circle, is released in September. Kingsman will return in the autumn, supported by a brand new wardrobe from MR PORTER. Until then, enjoy the sight of our spy as he charters a seaplane for a trip to the tropics. Armed with nothing but a suitcase or two of immaculate clothes, he offers up a masterclass in smart summer style.Shop the entire Kingsman collection here" True link

In addition to the clothing line in collaboration with Mr. Porter and costume designer Arianne Phillips,The Kingsman: Secret Service, out Sept. 22, is also bringing with it a new, premium liquor.After director Mathew Vaughn settled on the idea of having a bourbon business as the front for the sequel’s new stateside Statesman spies (led by Agent Champagne, played by Jeff Bridges), it didn’t take long for him to get in touch with the folks at Old Forester, a Kentucky-based brand which has been churning out “America’s first bottled bourbon” since the 1870s. “[Vaugn] was very purposeful in creating the equivalent of the British tailor shop as an homage to tradition for the second world, the Statesman world,” said Campbell Brown, president of Brown-Forman, which produces Old Forester. “He wanted a similar American type of backdrop for these spies to operate under and he landed on distilleries and bourbon.” He went on to describe a serendipitous conversation between his brother and Vaugn that took place across the pond, where he informed Vaugn of the rich family business which has been going strong for five generations.“That’s exactly the kind of thing he was looking for,” said Brown.From there, the Old Forester team assisted the Kingsman crew in re-creating an authentic set with all the proper vintage elements. “We provided his production team with some of the story elements, we showed them our Pre-Prohibition bottles, aging warehouses and barrels. Initially it was only a technical assistance,” noted Brown. “But then we got excited about the whole idea. Part of this film shows the Statesman brand, so we decided to create the actual Statesman Bourbon.” When asked if the whiskey bourbon was simply a current recipe repackaged with a fancy “Statesman” label, as some companies in the movie-marketing sphere are wont to do, Brown guffawed at the idea. “Of course we wouldn’t do that,” he said, before launching into a detailed description of the brewing process for the Statesman batch, which is smaller in volume, “with fewer barrels, which we selected from the warmest warehouses, and the locations from within the warehouses that get the most heat.” He said of the brew, “It’s got quite a bit of character.”And unlike the traditional Old Forester, which is 86 proof, the Statesman batch is 95 proof. “We wanted something really rich, like the characters,” he said. “Statesman has a depth that you wouldn’t get on the 86 proof. It has a more robust flavor and feel to it.”The Statesman bourbon ($55) will be available in limited quantities ahead of this weekend’s Kentucky Derby, and will be released wide to coincide with the film’s September release."

As the villains open fire on our hero’s vehicle, Eggsy gets in contact with Merlin (Mark Strong), who is at his computer and navigating him away from danger. When in a safe open area, the hood of Eggsy’s car slides open, and we watch from an aerial view the launching of three missiles that completely destroy the attackers.It happens that this conflict is no random incident, as we learn in voice over that there is an underworld organization that is swiftly working to specifically take out Kingsman agents. As we see a creepy robot assassin in action, it becomes clear that this group is highly technologically advanced, with members distinguishable by their lack of fingerprints and a circle tattoo made of 24 carat gold (hence the movie’s subtitle). It’s also clear that their tactics are wildly successful, as a montage shows some massive explosions – including the haberdashery that guises the Kingsman headquarters.It seems that these events leave Eggsy and Merlin all but completely out of resources, and while the former is panicked, the latter tells him to remember his training. Initiating “Doomsday Protocol,” Merlin reveals a safe, and explains that the answers to their problems rest within. What they are surprised to discover, however, is that the only thing inside is some bourbon labeled Statesman Whiskey. They drink until they hit the bottom of the bottle, and it’s there that they discover what they need to do next: the printing of “Distilled in Kentucky” with a circled, counter-clockwise-turned “K” tells them they have to head to the Bluegrass State.With the sound of “Saturday Night’s Alright (For Fighting)” by Elton John queuing up, Eggsy and Merlin make the 3000 mile journey across the Atlantic - and in another montage of awesomeness, we not only meet a couple of the fantastic actors joining the franchise as members of the Statesman (including Channing Tatum and Jeff Bridges), but also learn that Harry Hart is still alive and sporting a spiffy new eyepatch (you may remember he was shot in the eye while in Kentucky in the first Kingsman).From there, the footage sped up considerably, as we were treated to the sight of a robot dog in a bowling alley, our first look at Halle Berry (who proclaims to “like them geeky”), as well as the preferred weapon of Channing Tatum’s character: a laser lasso that we see him use to cut a dude cleanly in half. The big showstopper at the end featured a ride on a ski lift going incredibly wrong for our heroes with the cable snapping and plunging the car down the side of a mountain. Fortunately, it’s a pod that is outfitted with a giant American flag parachute (a clear reference to The Spy Who Loved Me). The first look ended with Eggsy saying, “That’s very American,” and Tatum’s Statesman agent laughing and enthusiastically replying with a thick Kentucky accent, “Fuck yeah!”" True link

So it depends what occurs, and whether it feels right to him, but I don’t think for a second that either he or myself, the lovely people at Fox and whoever else is interested in Kingsman, wouldn’t completely love it if this is a continuing series.Thanks to the poster and a little bit of PR hype, we know Elton John is involved in this one. I know he was definitely featured as himself in an early draft of the first film’s script. He even got to take part in a bit of action, helping to rescue… well, I won’t say who. I wouldn’t want to spoil it. But is the second film going back to pick up any of those same ideas?Matthew knows and likes Elton, and knows that he brings something that fits the tone of the Kingsman world. I think I can say that there’s a deleted scene from the first one, that I personally thought shouldn’t have been cut, and that’s now in the second film. But what it is… I don’t think I can say."

It’s so physical and demanding. It’s brilliant and you don’t resent a moment of it because I believe [director] Matthew Vaughn is an incredible director and I have every faith it’s going to be a great movie,” he said. “It’s so challenging. Luckily, you’re surrounded by an incredible team. The best stuntmen in the world. The cast is incredible. The cast in the sequel is … it’s insanity who I’ve acted opposite in the past six months. It was tough, but it’s going to be incredible.”About that “insanity”: The Kingsman sequel, which is out next year, stars original actors Egerton, Mark Strong, and Colin Firth, along with newcomers Channing Tatum, Jeff Bridges, Julianne Moore, Halle Berry, and Sir Elton John.The first film grossed $414 million worldwide, including $128 million in North America.

Vaughn has gathered quite the cast around them, with Jeff Bridges,Channing Tatum, Halle Berry, Pedro Pascaland Elton John among the new arrivals and Mark Strong, Sophie Cookson and Edward Holcroft the holdovers from the original.

The Hollywood Reporter brings word that Elton John is now in talks to join them.Not normally a man seen cropping up in movies (though his music is all over soundtracks, and he’s had a hand in films such as The Lion King and Gnomeo & Juliet), it’s not yet clear how John would fit into the Kingsman sequel, though he could very well just be playing himself for a cameo role. Or is he the new boss of the Kingsmen? Probably not…What we know for sure is that Taron Egerton and Mark Strong are back as Eggsy and Merlin, with Edward Holcroft returning to play Charlie.

A sequel titled Kingsman: The Golden Circle is currently on track for a June 2017 release and will follow protagonist Eggsy (Taron Egerton) and Merlin (Mark Strong) on a globetrotting adventure that sees them team up with the American-based Statesmen (led by Halle Berry’s character). Oscar winner Julianne Moore is said to be playing the film’s villain.The Kingsman series is quickly becoming known for star-studded ensembles, as the original featured heavy hitters like Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Caine, and Colin Firth. Even though Firth’s Harry Hart was killed in the first Kingsman, the creative team spent some time trying to brainstorm a way to bring him back for the next one. Recently, it seemed like any hopes of Firth returning were kaput, but the latest bit of Kingsman 2 marketing strongly suggests otherwise.Egerton took to Twitter to share a new poster for the upcoming film. Featuring a pair of the Kingsman glasses over the words “Reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated,” it certainly looks like moviegoers will be seeing more of Hart in the near future. Egerton’s caption sells the idea even further:With Harry’s return seemingly confirmed, it will be interesting to see how Vaughn handles the development. Hart’s death in the first film was a crucial story beat that pushed Eggsy into the field and become a member of the Kingsmen. Bringing Firth back to the fold runs the risk of undermining that key emotional arc, but it’s something that the filmmakers have been discussing since The Secret Servicewas released in February 2015. They’ve had plenty of time to iron out all the details and find a smart way to pull it off. Mark Millar has ensured viewers that Vaughn and company have a plan in place in case this was the route they decided to go in.Fake out deaths have become somewhat commonplace in the realm of genre entertainment these days (most noticeably in the Marvel Cinematic Universe), but few will be complaining if Firth reprises his role. Though Egerton was the breakout star of Kingsman, Firth was a revelation in his own right. He proved that he had more-than-capable action chops, particularly in the jaw-dropping church massacre sequence. Becoming an instant fan-favorite, the Academy Award winner seemed to have a great deal of fun playing the part, so it makes sense on several levels why Vaughn would want him for the sequel. As long as Hart’s survival is explained in a logical manner, his inclusion will be welcomed.It’ll also be nice to see Firth and Egerton working together again. The two had excellent chemistry in The Secret Service, developing a standout mentor/mentee relationship that proved to be the heart of the picture. Even though Eggsy is now firmly entrenched in the Kingsmen, there are always new things to learn and it helps to have a great teacher around to provide guidance and wisdom. Fleshing out their dynamic further could give The Golden Circle a poignant layer to explore, complimenting the action and comedy to craft a well-rounded film." True link

It pulled in high audience numbers, delighted critics and threw a well-aimed, and timely, genre grenade into the espionage field and then ran for cover.The inevitable sequel is now being talked about. Julianne Moore looks to be on the cards for the role of Kingsman 2’s main villain, Colin Firth’s dead Harry Hart will, despite early story ideas, actually stay dead, and the team of Eggsy and Merlin will be crossing the pond and heading for America. That’s according to one of the cast of the forthcoming film.Talking on the Radio 1’s “Movies with Ali Plumb” podcast surviving Kingsman Mark Strong explained the ideas being kicked around currently,“All I know is that it’s happening and that Merlin is in it, that Eggsy and Merlin team-up, that there is an American element.Through a number of conversations with Matthew [Vaughn], I know we’ll be filming in America, so I assume there is some American element to the second one.”Vaughn’s next big venture will be as producer on Dexter Fletcher’s future classic Eddie the Eagle which launches across the world very shortly. No details on yet on where Kingsman 2 features on his radar but the thought of nerd-commando Merlin and backdoor superspy Eggsy teaming up has us very excited." True link

A navy and rose-gold dial bearing the Kingsman logo has been added to the selection of the Connected Modular 45’s 30 pre-programmed digital dials and the ability to create a customized digital dial. Rose-gold lugs have been added to match, while the Kingsman logo also appears on the dial screen as the watch vibrates for 10 seconds at 10:10. Finally, two straps are included, one in caramel-hued leather and a second in orange velvet. (In the film’s trailer, Taron Egerton’s Eggsy is prominently seen wearing an orange velvet smoking jacket.)“We didn’t want Eggsy to become a carbon copy of [Colin Firth’s character],” Vaughn says. “He has his own identity, he’s from the street, he’s younger. So I wanted a watch that Eggsy would wear. We picked a lot of things this time around based on what Eggsy would wear, not what Colin would wear, and this is an Eggsy watch first and foremost.”" True link

But then I woke up one morning and had the story in my head.”JUST LIKE HOW PAUL MCCARTNEY WOKE UP WITH YESTERDAY IN HIS HEAD? “Something like that. But ultimately Kick Ass 2 was a learning curve how not to make the sequel. We didn’t intend to make a terrible film. Nobody does, only it can turn out that way sometimes. I was lucky with this one, the script wrote itself, I then thought ‘do I give it to someone else or look after it myself’. Again Kick Ass 2 taught me that lesson so I had to do it myself.”HOW DOES THE SCRIPT WRITING PROCESS WORK?  “I set about doing the first draft, I never do more than two drafts for a screenplay. It’s like being an architect trying to deliver what’s in my crazy mind. We start off with cards then discuss the things that are possible before executing the plan. Jane (Jane Goldman - co writer) is good, she keeps me on the straight and narrow. She puts in the warmth and I put in the crazy. It’s dark and it’s light - getting that balance.”HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT SHOULD STAY IN A SCRIPT AND WHAT SHOULD GO? “We had more of a budget for this one so we could try more things. The story is the driving force, it’s the emotional connection and it was really important to tell the story of Eggsy (played by Taron Egerton). It’s a continuation of his story, no one really knows where he is going to end up. With regards to what stays and goes, I might have to do a longer edit of this film one day. I’m cutting out loads of good stuff, I’m really wrestling with the length on this one and I hate long films. Ultimately it’s all instinct, I’ll watch it a bunch of times and if I get bored with certain sequences or they don’t make me laugh I’ll often leave them out.”WILL THERE BE A THIRD? “When I was writing this I had a big idea for Kingsman 3. If enough people go see Golden Circle, I’ll make another one. It’s very much like Empire (The Empire Strikes Back), this is a bridge and has to be resolved in the third.”" True link
