The amount of vitriol and anger that the anti-shipping circles not only accept but encourage is dangerous, unhealthy, and unless stopped will lead to more people being hurt.

You have every right to protect yourself from viewing objectionable content, but that right stops far, far short of hurting other people. Going on these crusades DOES NOT HELP against the sort of issues that are purportedly being championed; it only causes more harm. We need to break away from this mindset, from purity culture, before someone is permanently injured or dies.    FICTION =/= REALITYSTOP HURTING PEOPLE  Things like this makes me loose faith in humanity  Hall of Shame  jesus fuck these people " False text

The trick is, no one else in the circle knows the question.  Next, someone flips a flip-flop up in the air.  If it lands face up: the asker must say the question out loud to the whole group If the flip flop lands face down: the asker doesn’t say anything, and everyone in the group is left to wonder what in the world the question was.  And you go around the circle like that. The best questions have the answers as people. We like to limit it just to people in the circle, too. It just makes it more fun.  Here are some examples of good questions: You have to cover someone in the circle completely in peanut butter and lick it all off. Who? You and one other person must be surgically bound together for the rest of your life. Who is the other person? You and someone in the circle go in a dark room for 1 hour and do unspeakable things. Who? the creepy sexual ones are the best, and it’s really fun when you limit it to people in the circle. have fun " False text

Very male gaze. Good for fashion or model pictures, not very good if you’re wanting to draw a natural looking pose on a woman who isn’t a model and whose camera certainly didn’t fucking turn on by itself.IF YOU SEARCH: female sitting poseArguably worse, depending on the use. My experience with “female + pose” searches is that you get a lot of IMVU and The Sims pose sets, and artists making sketch compiliations that… don’t always have great anatomy and are frequently just more stiff model poses. I do use similar searches for pinup sketches, ie, “female sassy pinup pose,” though “posing for pinup photography” and “how to pose for” will give different results if you aren’t finding what you need.IF YOU SEARCH: woman student relaxing sitting on grass crossed legsCloser. Still kind of staged looking. Maybe we don’t want her studying. Maybe we just want her relaxing. Still, you start to see how specific keyword searches will really get you results.IF YOU SEARCH: woman sitting under tree grass relaxing nature summerNice. This is only a small handful of the results, but most of them more or less fit my mental image. Mostly stock images, but good for gesture sketches or figuring out a pose. Still… we could go further, and I think I will.IF YOU SEARCH: woman sitting under tree grass relaxing nature summer senior photographyJackpot. Senior pictures aren’t always awkward kids in braces. Look at how much more natural a few of these look? Compare that to the “Female sitting” search. Google Search tip #1 is basically “use more and specific keywords.”But just… one more thing I just… can’t get off my mind… what if I… just…IF YOU SEARCH: black   woman sitting under tree grass relaxing nature summer senior photography  Uh oh. So let me level with you, if you just google “dreadlocks,” expect a lot of white people. I spent over 30 minutes adding keywords to this search, and every page was still white people. Breaking it back down to “black woman sitting on grass” helped but gave me all the boring pose issues of the female sitting search. So basically, Google Search tip #2 is: Google image search is as White as the rest of the damn world. How do we find what we’re looking for now, then?IF YOU SEARCH: black woman sitting in grass nature tumblr blackoutBeautiful, natural poses. Adding “photography” whitewashed it. Adding “summer” gave me bikini pinups. Searching for POC models using Google image search is infinitely more frustrating than finding a million thin white women, and you’re usually going to be better off supporting POC modeling blogs themselves than fighting with Google all day. Using “tumblr” and “instagram” as keywords may also get you a lot more natural, less Vogue Was Here hits. Pinterest too, on occasion. But keep in mind that these are real people–especially using tags like “tumblr” or “blackout.” There’s a difference between referencing a pose or drawing different face shapes, and outright copying someone’s exact likeness without their permission. Maybe also consider liking/reblogging/following them if they’re a model or photographer. Use some common sense. You don’t own images found on google yadda yadda don’t be a dick.Have fun being better at search engines and learning how to draw stuff!" False text
