So here goes (feel free to add more if you think something’s missing)! 1) They hardly ever appear apartIn all the official art, comics, etc., Junkrat and Roadhog almost always appear together. The other Overwatch characters will appear alone or with varying people, but the junkers are always together. 2) They have matching/linked skinsAs far as I know, Junkrat and Roadhog are the only characters to have matching skins (Junkenstein and Junkenstein’s Monster) Please correct me if I’m wrong here! 3) Voice line developmentThey used to have a voice line exchange that would go: JR: You hook ‘em, I’ll cook ‘em.RH: Shut up. But now the line goes: RH: I’ll hook ‘em…JR: And I’ll cook ‘em! (x) 4) Matching Christmas spraysJunkrat and Roadhog now have a Christmas-themed spray showing the two junkers fistbumping while sipping drinks together on the beach. 5) They vacation/have fun togetherIn the Overwatch comic “Reflections” we get to see what the Overwatch characters do for Christmas. Junkrat and Roadhog are seen having the time of their lives racing around in a car: 6) They have a (super gay) theme songWhen the comic was released, Twitter user biscuitzombie asked the official OW Twitter which song the junkers were playing in their car, and OW responded with “Down Under” by Men at Work. It was quickly discovered that the song contains at least one reference to gay sex. 7) They exchange Christmas presentsAs part of Roadhog’s Christmas skin, his gun suddenly bore the label “From: Junkrat” and in a piece of art tweeted out by the official OW Twitter account, Junkrat can be seen unwrapping a t-shirt with a pachimari print, which Roadhog is known to love: 8) They are each other’s loved oneWhen launching the “Reflections” comic, the official OW Twitter tweeted out: “Join our heros as they head home for the holidays and celebrate the season with their loved ones: Junkrat and Roadhog are clearly celebrating together, ergo… loved ones!These were all I could think of, but please add more if I’ve missed some!  Additions (thank you to everyone who contributed!) 9) Coming outOn National Coming Out Day, Blizzard posted a picture of Junkenstein and his monster with the caption: “Find some who looks at you like Junkenstein looks at his monster”. 10) Who’s the top?In-game, when a Junkrat kills a Roadhog, Junkrat will sometimes say, “Guess we know who’s really on top, don’t we?” and it’s pretty hard to imagine that the writers didn’t know double meaning of “top”. 11) Junker ChristmasOn December 25th 2016, the official Overwatch Twitter posted this picture: It’s not an official Overwatch/Blizzard artist, but since it’s been posted by an official Overwatch account, it’s fair to conclude that they at worst approve of it and at best consider it canon. So, the junkers celebrate Christmas together <3  Wasn’t there something about roadhogs badges on his vest in his original skin too? Like, they were signifiers amongst gays/bikers for safe sex, etc.? I’ll have to find the source cause I remember someone asking an actual biker about it and confirming this. " False text
