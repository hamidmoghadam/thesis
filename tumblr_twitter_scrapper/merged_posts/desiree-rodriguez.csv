White women in the media are both sexualized and viewed as ideal and conventionally attractive, white women tend to take a position that pushes back on all forms of the male gaze which includes both sexualization, and being viewed as conventionally attractive.   Which is fine because of their dominant position as the apple of men’s eye they’re never going to doubt themselves as the most attractive species (even when it’s unwanted and generally unfavorable, and comes with a strict set of rules and beauty standards, because even if a white girl feels ugly, internal racism is still going to make her value herself higher than brown girls) but generally when white women reject beauty standards, they have enough support that it doesn’t adversely affect their mental well-being.  Now onto WOC. The system is completely different, woc are considered play things and sexual objects in a way that is unparalleled by their white counterparts. White women don’t /want/ to feel beautiful woc never /got/ to. And that matters, in a world where beauty, especially for women, determines worth, when women of color were never considered beautiful in the first place, their self worth is nonexistent.  So when woc say things like “I want to feel beautiful” a lot of white women mistake that for “I want to look good for men” which can be true if you’re white (even though everyone should be allowed to feel attractive in whatever way they want)  But with women of color the meaning shifts to more like “I want to feel like I have value, I want to feel loved and respected and to be attractive. Eurocentric beauty standards have never fit me, and with those being all the media I ever consumed, they’ve cemented themselves in my brain, I deserve to be desirable in a non inherently sexual way.”  And white women literally can’t empathize with this, which is okay! But there has to be an understanding that feminism isn’t one size fits all in which white women are the proxy. ok but then the solution is to destroy the notion that for women beauty is our value rather than make woc “valuable?”  do mainstream feminists not see the issue here?   I know you mean well (maybe), but what you’re suggesting is still throwing women of color under the bus. In the long run, sure, destroying the idea of beauty being tied to a woman’s value is the ultimate goal, but as long as white women are able to use their privilege in this area against non-white women, we cannot move forward. At this point, destroying the notion of beauty=value would only benefit white women in the long run since that idea is tied to their unique brand of oppression as opposed to women of color (and even then you can break it down further). What needs to be addressed before anything else is that different women have different needs. While it is still misogyny at work, white women do benefit from being considered the epitome of beauty/femininity because of their racial privilege. They get the benefit of the doubt of humanity where this is not true of women of color. Before there can be any dismantling of misogyny and beauty ideals, we need to address the dehumanization of women of color first; especially how white women engage with them and contribute to their oppression. Also, if you want to dismantle the idea of beauty=value, you’d also have to take down the other systems that keep it in place such as white supremacy and capitalism. Removing white women’s privilege is a must if you want to “destroy the notion that for women beauty is our value”. Basically what I’m saying here is that if you want to destroy the beauty=value idea, you’ve got more work to do than you thought. And that work has to include considering the needs of women of color rather than disregarding them as you suggested.  -pink  ^^^^^Intersectionality means at the very least respecting the points of view of women of color, especially when they contradict white feminism."

But that doesn’t mean she doesn’t deserve happiness. What if someone told your mother “what are you getting married for?

Let me start by saying, no matter how popular the blog or how cool you think they are, everyone loves a compliment.  If you’re worried about sounding silly or bothering people, let me assure you- a message will make your writer do a happy dance (depending on the writer, they may actually get up and dance.  I have.) Here’s the basic ways of communicating with writers on Tumblr: Likes and kudos- these are great, they’re the high-fives in this world.  They’re the “hey, nice” nod.Reblogs- even better, because they mean exposure.  More people see the story and that makes us really happy.  A reblog with a comment is amazing, especially one that entices others to read.  These make a writer’s day.Comments and messages- these are the thing that keeps us going.  Most of us have anon turned on- and if we don’t, just let us know you want a private reply.  (And, if your writer has anon off, it probably means they’ve been getting hate and deserve extra love.)Recommendations- recs are like coming in to work to find someone baked your favorite cake and left it on your desk.  Recommendations make your writer feel so loved and valued! So, that’s all good, but what do you actually SAY to writers?  It doesn’t have to be much or take a lot of time. A simple “This is great/funny/hot!” is wonderful.  ""Best fic I’ve read this week!“  ""Funny as hell and cute too.”  ""You have to read this, it’s awesome!“  ""I can’t wait for more of this.”  ""I hope you keep going!“  These are great in reblogs and in messages. Even better is specific feedback.  We love specific feedback, because it tells us what readers liked and what they didn’t.  Want to influence our next fic?  Tell us what you liked about this one and I bet you it will keep showing up!  Specific feedback is just telling the writer what you liked.  It doesn’t have to be long or complicated, either.  (But if you write a lot, we will love you so much.) Was there a character you liked?  Talk about them:  ""I love how you wrote X” “Y was so funny!”  ""OMG I wanted to STRANGLE Q!“  ""You can really feel X’s frustration.”  ""Y has so much depth, they’re a really well-rounded character.“  ""R says so much with so few words, it’s amazing.” What about a part or line you enjoyed?  ""That bit in the park- LOVE IT.“  ""I have never read a better description of a cup of tea.”  ""The way you wrote about his fear, that was heartbreaking.“ Was there a part that made you feel something?  Happy, sad, angry?  ""That last sentence killed me, he’s so broken.”  ""I wanted to jump around when they finally kissed!“  ""This chapter was so tense, my heart was pounding by the end.” Did the characters or plot or setting remind you of your life?  ""I live in Brussels, that’s just how that street looks.“  ""When Y talked about R, I knew exactly how he felt.”  ""You captured that lost, aimless feeling perfectly; I’ve so been there.“ Are there unanswered questions?  Mention how much you want the answers.  ""I can’t wait to find out what’s in the basket!”  ""That was a cliffhanger ending, wow.“  ""How is she going to explain THAT?”  (some writers are touchy about  predicting, though, so stay away from “I bet he’ll throw that letter out.” or “X is clearly coming back.”) A few closing notes: be enthusiastic if that’s your style, go crazy with exclamation marks, smileys, caps!  Tell a writer if you’re rereading their work- very little makes us happier than knowing our writing has the staying power for a second, third, sixth, tenth read.  Did a reread give you a new insight or feeling about the fic?  Tell us!  We will be so excited to hear.  And remember, recommendations are wonderful- putting up a random post tagging your favorite writers or fics you’re enjoying will show the writers that they’re writing is more than a flash in the opan and they’ll get some new readers too! We can’t do this writing thing without you guys.  So thank you so much!  Without readers, we’re just talking to ourselves.  We love and appreciate you for reading- but we need to know you’re doing it.  We need feedback like we need air.  Don’t let your favorite writers suffocate! :)  Always reblog.  Never scroll past and not reblog. " False text

Romani are usually excluded whenever the topic of the Holocaust/WW2 comes up, so it’s not all too surprising that the Romani Day of Resistance is very unknown to the majority. But it should be celebrated and embraced since it represents a change in the way Romani culture and identity appear in public space - where a history of resistance replaces a history of oppression: On 15 May 1944, the underground resistance movement in the Auschwitz, Birkenau concentration camp   BIIe  warned the Roma that the SS guards were planning to round up the nearly 6,000 Roma and Sinti prisoners and send them to the gas chambers.  On the morning of 16 May, the Romani prisoners did not show up for the usual morning roll call and ceased cooperating with the SS guards. The Roma barricaded themselves into their shanties. They had broken into an equipment warehouse and armed themselves with hammers, pickaxes and shovels, taking apart the wooden sections of the bunks they slept on to make wooden stakes.  When the SS guards approached the area, they were met with armed resistance from the inmates.  The prisoners forced the guards into retreat, and though some prisoners were shot that night, the act of resistance allowed the Roma and Sinti prisoners to put off execution for several more months. The SS were in shock because they had completely failed to anticipate this resistance. Concerned they might lose more men and that the uprising might spread to other parts of Auschwitz, they retreated from camp BIIe. No Roma died in the gas chambers that day. The Nazis subsequently put the prisoners of BIIe on a starvation diet. Later, on 23 May 1944 the Nazis moved 1,500 of the strongest Romani prisoners to Auschwitz I, many of whom were then sent to Buchenwald concentration camp. On 25 May 1944, 82 Romani men were transported to the Flossenburg concentration camp and 144 young Romani women were sent to the Ravensbrück concentration camp.   Less than 3,000 Romani prisoners remained in the family camp at BIIe, most of them children. On 2 August 1944, the Nazis gassed all the remaining Romani prisoners to death in gas chamber V, although the Roma fought back on that dark night as well.   In Hungary the 2nd of August was designated in 2005 by the Parliament as “Roma and Sinti Genocide Remembrance Day”, yet most European countries make no or insufficient mention of the Roma victims in their official position regarding the Holocaust.    Roma are still misrepresented by stereotypes that overshadow our culture and real identity and it should be needless to say that Europe should put some effort on making the Roma genocide widely known and recognized, to serve as a counterforce to the increasingly violent rhetoric and action against the Roma because and through them. Yet it does not seem like anything like that will happen any time soon.  & Yes, please reblog this to make at least some of our history known. " False text

But we also need the arts as a protective factor against authoritarianism. In saving the arts, we save ourselves from a society where creative production is permissible only insofar as it serves the instruments of power. When the canary in the coal mine goes silent, we should be very afraid — not only because its song was so beautiful, but also because it was the only sign that we still had a chance to see daylight again.” This is also why you should think about how you criticize art. I’m not saying don’t do it, I’m saying think it through.  Fuck that ‘youre not a full human without the arts’ bullshit.  Oh, come off it, you’re a) missing the point and b) drastically underestimating how much art you use every day. Architecture is art. Fashion is art- and yes, even if you ‘don’t give a damn’ about fashion and dress in ‘what’s comfortable’, someone had to design your fucking cargo shorts to be maximally comfy. Industrial design is art. Furniture design is art. Cooking is art.  You might be able to be a ~full human~ without being moved by interpretive wheelchair dance, but you can’t be a comfortable or happy one without some kind of goddamn art.    That cuts both ways. “Why do you need arts funding when we already have houses and clothes? That’s art to, you know.”  Okay. I’m going to come at this from a perspective of a robot who does not understand why art even exists. I understand that that is probably not you, but these are reasons for art to exist that assume you do not give a damn about art. Firstly: fine art creates utility for many other people. Whether or not you find any utility in it yourself, many people in your community do. I do not find sports particularly valuable- I honestly think there’s not much in the world that’s more boring than men running around on a field kicking a ball- but most other people seem to for some reason. If the other people in my community want to fund sports, I think they should receive funding even if I’m individually against it. Because clearly, they’re getting something out of it. Secondly: Fine art employs a lot of members of the community who would otherwise be unemployable. The tormented artist stereotype has a grain of truth in it: many artists struggle with physical and mental illness. Having a career in art- like many other careers where you’re self-employed- means being able to work at your own pace. Having too many bad days in a row won’t get you fired. Funding the arts means giving disabled people the time and breathing room they need to begin a career on their own merits, without working themselves to death trying to hold down a more ‘normal’ job.   Thirdly: art gives us a common language we can use to communicate, in the same way that science does. If I say a government policy is “Orwellian”, for example, you know I mean “it’s dictatorial”, with the heavy implication that it creates a surveillance state. If I say something is a “Cinderella story”, you know I mean it’s an underdog story, presumably with a heavy element of rags-to-riches. Art creates connotations and shades of meaning that enrich and deepen human communication. There are as many good reasons to fund art as there are to fund higher maths, honestly. Number theory isn’t immediately useful to anyone’s life, and yet I don’t think you’d have any problem with the government funding mathematics departments.  I might come across really terrible right now, but how does anyone not understand “We need the arts because they make us full human beings.”? Is there anyone who listens to no music, watches no shows or movies, reads no books or comics, plays no games ever?   To get more simple, the art of storytelling has existed pretty much forever. Even if we pull out the shit that’s strictly functional, who lives that life? Please, introduce me to them because I’m curious about the quality of their lives. It sounds horrible and depressing. Maybe “full human beings” isn’t quite fair wording, but mental and emotional health is vastly improved by these things and it’s ridiculous to claim that it isn’t. I won’t say everyone has to create to be at their happiest. I can’t personally process not creating things, but I understand that not everyone’s into it. (Though I could argue that to some extent things like doodling while bored and humming or whistling are in themselves acts of creation.) But most human beings ever have consumed art, regardless of what kind. It is a very important part of most people’s lives. " False link

Before the events of the 2016 film, T’Challa’s father T’Chaka ruled over Wakanda as king, while the heir to the throne protected his home in disguise as the Black Panther. However, now that his father has died, T’Challa must not only be a superhero, but his country’s head of state as well. As seen in the new behind-the-scenes reel, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige asserted that “going forward, Black Panther will be a big part of the cinematic universe. Codenamed “Motherland,” Black Panther is currently in production, filming at Atlanta’s Pinewood Studios and other locations around the globe to bring the weird, wild world of Wakanda to life. The footage, which, as mentioned earlier, was unfinished, showed off a variety of brief scenes from Black Panther, including a few action scenes and a few quieter moments of Wakandan life. One of the first scenes we saw depicted Lupita Nyong’o doing what she told me she was most excited to do when I spoke with her at the Toronto International Film Festival: kicking some butt. Nyong’o plays Nakia, a fierce warrior and member of the Dora Milaje, Black Panther’s elite retinue of female bodyguards. Clad in a drab olive cloak, Nakia sneaks up on unsuspecting soldiers wielding assault rifles and beats them to a pulp quickly and quietly while their compatriots shoot at the darkness. The best part was actually an unscripted accident: when Nyong’o executed a combat roll to hide behind a jeep, part of her cloak got stuck on the car and she had to extricate it like nothing happened.

On Thursday, the Ava DuVernay drama unveiled its lineup of all-female directors for the upcoming season as well as a return date.     OWN and producer Warner Bros. Television also announced a new deal with Hulu that will make the streamer the exclusive SVOD home for Queen Sugar. The first season will be available to stream beginning April 21st.   Like season one, season two will feature an all-female directing team that includes returning producer-director Kat Chandler, DeMane Davis (Lift), Cheryl Dune (HBO’s Stranger Inside), Aurora Guerrero (Mosquita y Mari) and Amanda Marsalis (Echo Park), who will make her episodic television debut on Queen Sugar.     The rest of the directing team for Queen Sugar’s sixteen-episode second season, which launches with a two-night event on June 20th and 21st at 10 p.m, will be announced at a later date.     Queen Sugar was one of the first TV dramas to assemble an all-female directing team. The decision came in the wake of troubling statistics from the Directors Guild of America and other organizations about the lack of female and minority directors in television despite the current Peak TV era that has born more than 400 original scripted series. During the 2014-15 TV season, only 16 percent of TV directors were females.    Since then, several others in Hollywood have also made it their mission to increase the number of females and minorities behind the camera. Prolific producer and director Ryan Murphy launched the Half foundation to ensure that half of all the episodes of television he produces are directed by females and minorities. Hulu’s period drama Harlots, which launched last month on the streamer, assembled an all-female directing team as well as an all-female writer’s room. “Forward-thinking people and allies of this cause within the industry have the common sense to know that this is systemic,” DuVernay told THR last August. “There needs to be more done than applauding one or two people who make it through your door.” " False link

A leader of the Tarahumara people who live among the jagged peaks of the western Sierra Madre, Mr. Baldenegro defended the area’s old-growth forests against powerful local strongmen allied with drug traffickers and loggers. The killing was the second of a Goldman prizewinner in less than a year. Last March, gunmen attacked and killed Berta Cáceres, who led her Lenca people of Honduras against a proposed dam. Seven people have been arrested in her killing, but in a statement on Sunday, her family said that the Honduran government had yet to investigate who had ordered it. The death of Mr. Baldenegro, coming so soon after Ms. Cáceres’ murder, highlights the danger faced by environmental defenders in Latin America, where mining, energy, agribusiness and logging interests have generated violent conflict with local communities. His fight to protect his community’s ancestral lands went back decades, and his father, Julio Baldenegro, was assassinated in 1986 for his opposition to logging. Keep reading " False link

According to local news reports, centers in New York, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Texas and Alabama were targeted.  “It appears to be the same serial caller” as in the prior incidents, Goldenberg told JTA. Goldenberg said that some of the JCCs were evacuated and others were not. “The JCCs are very well-equipped to handle this,” he said. Goldenberg did not confirm where any of the threats occurred, saying they took place across the country and that his office “is monitoring the situation.” Goldenberg said the fact that the threats were made on Presidents Day, when more people might be in the buildings during the daytime, does not appear to be a factor in the threats. Last week, President Donald Trump was asked during a news conference about the prior JCC bomb threats and what the government’s response would be to “an uptick in anti-Semitism.” Although the reporter did not suggest Trump was anti-Semitic, the president answered by denying he is an anti-Semite and called the question “insulting.” The Harry & Rose Samson Family Jewish Community Center in Whitefish Bay, Milwaukee was evacuated Monday morning after receiving  threatening phone calls, the Journal Sentinel reported. Two Jewish Community Centers in Buffalo, New York were also evacuated Monday morning following bomb threats, the Buffalo News reported. The St. Paul Jewish Community Center in Minnesota was evacuated Monday morning after a bomb threat, the Star Tribune reported citing local police. the Evelyn Rubenstein Jewish Community Center in Houston, Texas was also evacuated following a bomb threat received by phone, a local NBC affiliate reported.

Dinah Laurel Lance is ultimately her own separate character apart from Green Arrow and Oliver Queen. The show should have worked harder to establish her as a separate character from the get-go instead of a spurned lover Oliver cheated on. There were shades of the comics Dinah Lance in Arrow’s depiction, and there was the clear signs of a narrative journey being taken towards her becoming the Black Canary. However it became clear by the time season three rolled around the show lost interest. Forgot who the Black Canary was – more than a leather jacket, motorcycle riding woman with a sharp tongue and a sonic cry – and why she was important. Laurel as such suffered as a character. Reduced to a rushed short term story arc, quickly pushed further and further aside, and lost more narrative relevance. Until finally the show decided to just up and kill the Black Canary, a longterm important character within the DC Universe and an important part of the overall narrative of Arrow itself.While Laurel lost screentime, her overall presence was still relative to the story at hand. She existed as a central figure within the overall fabric of the narrative having ties and history with Oliver, Thea, Sara, Moria, Lance, Diggle, and Tommy.  Viewers could see this in Arrow’s 100th episode which emphasized how central Laurel and Oliver once were to the show’s narrative.Now there’s little reason for Lance to even exist on the show given that his storyline is a circular tragedy of losing one daughter to gain another to lose another and end in and out of rehabs. Thea lost a sister figure and her own screentime has gone down dramatic. Oliver lost a close childhood friend, and a huge part of his past (namely the first two seasons) as well as his canonical comic longterm partner.So the misstep is two-fold; the show purposely cast aside one of the long standing characters that originally had an on-going and solid arc to explore and develop, and an iconic comic book character. This isn’t such a problem that can be fixed with the insertion of a new character that happens to also have the name Dinah Drake. Which appears to be the most popular name in Star City.”" True link
