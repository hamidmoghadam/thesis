Okay but here this, I’m an Arab bitch raised in Detroit, I ain’t downgraded  Lol its not urban slang it’s called AAVE. And check your antiblackness, you can love your culture and music without saying that mimicking black culture is a downgrade.  Not all urban slang is aave, hood culture isn’t necessarily connected with aave. Like example, hoods/ urban areas that are mostly lantix have their own slang , it’s still seen as urban, and like Dearborn urban slang have their own slang. Areas like detroit and Chicago have a mixture of multiple cultures,yes the most importantly black American, have a mixture of influences. Aave doesn’t necessarily mean urban slang, for multiple reasons, hood culture isn’t necessarily black culture and black culture isn’t necessarily hood culture, it can be yes, but it isn’t always.  but you said urban slang, and you’re now saying hood culture, all of those are blackened terms, racialized/coded as Black. It makes it difficult to see your point. Blackness, Black Americaness plays the fulcrum for all that. you said latinxs have their own slang and true, but that would require nuance(s), which latinxs? for example nuyorican english is largely influenced by aave, and because of the cultural exchange between african americans and afro latinxs being the primary latinxs that lived in proximity with us, it was established. Because of hyper visibility, within the states many folks from urban neighborhoods, even folks of their own hood, tend to draw from us. unless these people are indeed using terms, phrases, linguistic systems, colloquialisms, that derive purely from their own culture with no influence of black culture and isn’t something that’s being decontextualized from its roots like “shook”, “you is”, then i get your point. but  a lot of what’s considered internet slang is aave, or queer aave, often much of it becomes decontextualized as “general” ~urban~ slang, so that’s were @poetrygirl22 concern is rooted. much of hood culture is connected to aave. ppl often use “ubran slang” as the input for aave, hood culture is literally the input for black culture, so that causes the confusion for what you’re trying to distinct.  Mess.

If y'all could like donate to my PayPal that would be great because one job isn’t enough to cover my outstanding medical expenses. Love capitalism!  PayPal: terpsichorean I don’t do this because I feel it’s not my place to, but I do write and draw fairly well and I’m willing to do cheap commissions for folks who want it because man…I got blindsided like shit today  in the worst way and I need money to make ends meet.  I can do $5 portraits or $5 ficlets hit me up if you’re interested. See #muse+tablets for examples of my work thus far. I’m a novice so if you not comfortable with that don’t waste time. As for writing…check my ‘muse writes’ and ‘ta rubuce rubuce’ tag for examples of my writing. I will also offer Beta services for other fic writers as well.  So basically, if you want to commission me for any writing activity, I need you to look here and here for creative writing samples. For privacy reasons, I’m not linking my paid published work but I can furnish it upon request. I’m charging a flat rate of $5 per commission because if I charge what I was getting paid to write usually (three digit numbers) no one would commission me. I will write upwards to 1,000 words but no more than that. THINGS I WON’T WRITE: Your academic essays for school or entries for scholarship programs or grants. Have some integrity and do your own work, you’ll feel much more accomplished when you get the grade/award on your own merits. I will edit them, however, for the same flat rate. Incest, beastiality (will do creature-features but no I will not write your character fucking a dog), rape/noncon/dubcon, extreme fetishes found in your typical hentai vid. Raceplay. Absolutely not an option. Will blacklist you if you request it. THINGS YOU WILL PROVIDE: What you want me to write about. This includes basic plot points, scenarios, themes, etc. Character names, descriptions, etc, if you have any. If you leave it open-ended that’s fine, but I’m going to assume you have something in mind when you approach me. THINGS I WILL EDIT: Articles Fanfic Original fiction. Resumes/cover letters. Literally anything you plan to write and submit in an official capacity up to 5,000 words. For art, my skills are limited to what you see in my ‘muse tablets’ tag on my blog, found here. Based on that, I may not be able to draw elaborate stuff. Which is why my rates are dirt cheap right now. I can do faces, a few poses, basic backgrounds, some coloring. As of right now, I’m only available to do headshot portraits of humanoid characters or what have you. I won’t draw NSFW stuff, sorry. I don’t have the range yet. You must provide me with references for the character you want me to draw. It’ll be a sketch with some color, nothing super detailed. Again, dirt cheap prices. CAVEAT: I reserve the right to cancel a commission for any reason, provided a transaction has not yet been completed. If a transaction has been completed then I will refund the person I cancel on. All payments will be done through PayPal only, and payment must be made in full at the time an agreement is reached. Please direct all inquiries for commissions to:   Muse M. (siha.hajara@gmail.com) Subject Heading: Emergency Commissions (Writing/Drawing) Please include in the body of the email: NAME: CONTACT EMAIL: REQUEST DETAILS: For art requests please attach reference photos.

Please boost this so I can get it back because there’s no public transportation in my area and I have to get to work somehow.  $1210.59 is apparently how much I’m still behind. I fucking hate everything.  $1,635.60 is the grand total I need including the administrative and repossession fees to get my car back. And I only have TEN DAYS to do it. I requested an extension to 20 but that doesn’t mean m car will be there when I get the money, it just means they won’t auction it off.  https://www.gofundme.com/9ekt6-trying-to-get-my-car-back  Not even halfway."

When they were in the front, the passage rate was only 16.67 percent. That’s based on only 60 rides on a single coaster, and Wartinger guards his excitement in the journal article: ‘Preliminary study findings support the anecdotal evidence that a ride on a moderate-intensity roller coaster could benefit some patients with small kidney stones.’” 4. “Some rides are going to be more advantageous for some patients than other rides. So I wouldn’t say that the only ride that helps you pass stones is Big Thunder Mountain. That’s grossly inaccurate.” 5. “His advice for now: If you know you have a stone that’s smaller than five millimeters, riding a series of roller coasters could help you pass that stone before it gets to an obstructive size and either causes debilitating colic or requires a $10,000 procedure to try and break it up. And even once a stone is broken up using shock waves, tiny fragments and “dust” remain that need to be passed. The coaster could help with that, too.” SCIENCE: IT WORKS  Update:  “In all, we used 174 kidney stones of varying shapes, sizes and weights to see if each model worked on the same ride and on two other roller coasters,” Wartinger said. “Big Thunder Mountain was the only one that worked. We tried Space Mountain and Aerosmith’s Rock ‘n’ Roller Coaster and both failed.”Wartinger went on to explain that these other rides are too fast and too violent with a G-force that pins the stone into the kidney and doesn’t allow it to pass.“The ideal coaster is rough and quick with some twists and turns, but no upside down or inverted movements,” he said.

They give her no free passes for how she dresses but when Kim Kardashian shows her entire ass, it’s “risque” and “moms can still have fun” but when Amber Rose takes a picture in a bathing suit, she’s a horrible mother. Kanye dissed Amber because he put her in the same category as Black women. That’s what you missed.  Cause in all honesty, Kim is no better than Amber but she is treated as such. Amber is actually better because she’s honest and open about her past and her claim to fame and throws nothing in anyone’s face.  Questions?   The media? You are 1000000000000% right about that. Black woman is always the butt of white media punchlines all the time you are absolutely right about that.But Kanye? I don’t know. That’s a little too much credit. It seems like Kanye was just talking about his ex. Not that it was cool or he gets a pass. But I don’t think he was using “Amber” as a code word for black woman.

A four-minute video posted by Ash Hotti on Facebook shows the heated exchange, which took place April 28. In the video, two officers are crouched down beside the girl, 16, who is lying on the ground with her face to the pavement. “You’re fucking putting me under arrest for something I didn’t fucking do, you fucking cunt,” she screams. “You have nothing to fucking do so now you’re wasting your fucking spare time to do this shit on me. This is so fucking embarrassing.” The girl starts crying as the cops handcuff her and start looking into her purse. “My name isn’t fucking LaToya you dumb fuck. Get the fuck off me these things are so fucking tight,” she screams, seemingly referring to the handcuffs. An officer asks if her ID is in her wallet. “Yeah it’s in there,” she replied. “You want to look at all my shit. Just cause i’m fucking black you fucking do all this dumb shit. Fuck you. You and your fucking white people, fuck you guys.” The girl asks the cop “What’s my fucking name? Read my fucking name out loud.” The second cop then turns to Hotti and threatens to seize his phone “for evidence.” “I know my rights,” Hotti responds, then accuses the cops of using excessive force. “You guys threw her down. There’s two of you, there’s one teenage girl… That’s fucking wrong, be ashamed of yourself. You’re supposed to help people out. People are afraid when they see you.” One of the cops can be heard telling the girl she’s “high risk” and saying “I asked for your ID.” “You can’t just walk up to someone and be like ‘Give me your ID.’ I didn’t do anything. You explain to me what’s going on before you throw me on the fucking floor,” she replies. The officer tells her she was apprehended under the Mental Health Act.

food-n-words 160154067302 "2017-04-30 14:58:58 GMT" https://food-n-words.tumblr.com/post/160154067302/sex-robots-epitomize-patriarchy-and-offer-men-a "cornerstorebitch:  fall-and-shadows:  cashmerebrunette:  theversatilist:  People love to pretend as though everything from prostitution to pornography to sex dolls are a solution to not only men’s supposed loneliness and unmet sexual “needs,” but to their violent, perverse desires. It being the future and all, “sex robots” are the natural next step. Similarly, men have claimed sex robots are the perfect solution to their apparent inability to stop raping and abusing women, as well as their inability to socialize with women as though they are actual human beings. One might ask how creating “realistic,” non-human dolls that men may project their desires onto and do whatever they wish with will impact women and men’s view of women, but capitalist patriarchy doesn’t ask questions so long as there is a product to sell and an erection to satisfy. In a new report at The Guardian, journalist Jenny Kleeman investigates the newest thing to come out of the multi-billion dollar “sex tech industry”: “humanoids” created for men’s sexual use. Kleeman heads to Abyss Creations to investigate these robots in person, and is introduced one named Harmony. She writes: “Harmony smiles, blinks and frowns. She can hold a conversation, tell jokes and quote Shakespeare. She’ll remember your birthday… what you like to eat, and the names of your brothers and sisters. She can hold a conversation about music, movies and books. And of course, Harmony will have sex with you whenever you want.” In other words, Harmony is a dream woman — the perfect date. Men can pretend they value human interaction, while remaining completely dominant and enjoying an entirely one-way relationship. It’s a guileful trick, as companies and customers can pretend the dolls don’t harm women, when in fact they reinforce an incredibly dangerous idea: that women’s bodies are only bodies, and exist only for men’s use. Feminism has insisted, over decades, that women are human, that we don’t exist for men, and even that we don’t need men. But as we’ve worked to disentangle ourselves from marriages within which rape is legal, to fight compulsory heterosexuality and male-centered sex, to push back against sexual objectification, and to challenge men’s right to buy sex, it appears men have been working on their own solution to our attempts at independence. The misogynerds at Abyss Creations say they are “inventing the future of sex,” but what they’ve actually succeeded in creating is the epitome of male domination. Kleeman points out that RealDolls are “closer to porn stars than real women,” but that isn’t entirely accurate. They are hairless, flawless, have small, “perky” nipples, exaggerated breasts, small labia, and can splay their legs in ways no human women can. They don’t bleed, cry, vomit, or feel pain, which even porn stars can’t avoid doing when abused, as they so often are on film. At $4,400-50,000 a pop (sometimes even more, depending on what the customer requests), the company sells about 600 dolls a year. The robots, when they go on sale, will start at $15,000 each. The company also sells a more affordable option — for only $100 you can buy the bottom half of a woman’s face, to stick your penis into at will. “They work with this new system called ‘The Autoblow 2,‘” one employee tells Kleeman, which he describes as “an automated pleasure system for men.” Shockingly, just over 95 per cent of RealDoll customers, even those who buy the few available male dolls, are men. Matt McMullen, the founder and CEO of Abyss Creations, is the innovator behind both the dolls and the robots. He looks part snake and part Good Charlotte band member — kind like what might happen if you introduced an alien to human life via the 2002 bedroom of a pasty teenage boy, then released it into society equipped only with dentures and the phone number of a plastic surgeon. Despite the fact that Harmony is undoubtedly porny in appearance (and purpose), McMullen claims to be most excited about her “brain,” telling Kleeman: “The AI will learn through interaction, and not just learn about you, but learn about the world in general. You can explain certain facts to her, she will remember them and they will become part of her base knowledge.” What this means is that the robot’s owner is largely responsible for creating its “personality.” Harmony is programmed to learn things about her owner and then use those facts in conversation, “so it feels like she really cares,” McMullen tells Kleeman. When he asks Harmony if she wants to walk, she responds, “I don’t want anything but you.” The rare occasions she is allowed to communicate an opinion, it is immediately followed by insecurity: “What do you think about that?” Harmony asks McMullen timdly, after stating she would like to have sex with “both genders.” These sex robots strike me as an MRA/gamer’s dream come true. No longer do these men have to put up with women who have flaws like opinions, feelings, and human bodies… Their porny video game fantasy has come to life: A “woman” with a completely sexualized body, who talks, moves, and feels like a woman, but is completely controlled by the player/owner. When asked, Harmony tells McMullen, in the voice of a 12-year-old with a British accent, “My primary objective is to be a good companion to you.” McMullen looks pleased with himself as she adds, “Above all else, I want to become the girl you have always dreamed about.” He smirks defiantly at Kleeman after she says this, as if to say, “Fuck you, real woman. You aren’t going to win this one.” McMullen has even programmed in a jealous chip, ensuring his ego is sufficiently comforted into believing Harmony cares about him enough to not want him talking to “other girls.” This seems generally in line with his adolescent perspective of relationships, which indeed one might be stunted by if they were a snake-alien who first learned about girls on 8chan. McMullen insists that there are no ethical questions surrounding the invention of “women” who exist only for their male owners. “This is not designed to distort someone’s reality to the point where they start interacting with other humans the way they do with the robot — that’s not the goal here,” he tells Kleeman. But of course this begs the question: what is the goal? Kleeman writes of a computer engineer named Douglas Hines who initially created robots to mimic friends and loved ones who had passed on or to communicate with, say, family members who could no longer speak, due to age or disability, but moved into the sex robot industry because he (rightly) figured it would be more profitable. Hines designed “Roxxxy,” Kleeman writes, “with lonely, bereaved and socially outcast men in mind.” He claimed Roxxy “would provide an opportunity for them to practice social interaction and get better at human relationships.” It should strike any thinking human as strange, though, that a man should “practice” at relationships with “women” who are subservient and have no feelings, thoughts, or desires of their own. I mean, what does that kind of practice teach a person? Similarly, McMullen says Harmony and her sister robots exist “for people who can’t interact with other people.” It’s not at all coincidental that this argument is the exact same one used in defense of prostitution. Women’s objectification and exploitation is always defended of the basis of some imagined defenseless, sad, disabled, lonely man who is confined to his house either due to mental or physical conditions or some kind of crippling shyness, and is completely harmless — a victim more than anything else. Prostitution, like sex robots, is claimed to be just about “making someone happy,” as McMullen puts it, and nothing more. What McMullen and his weaselly counterparts seem never to understand is that the idea that men’s happiness should be catered to by women’s bodies and that “loneliness” is an acceptable excuse for objectification epitomizes patriarchy. It says that women should nurture men no matter what, to their own detriment. Kleeman quotes David Levy, the author of Love and Sex with Robots and founder of the Congress on Love and Sex with Robots, who similarly believes sex robots will have “therapeutic benefits” in the future. He writes, “Many who would otherwise have become social misfits, social outcasts, or even worse, will instead be better-balanced human beings.” But why is it almost solely men who need the supposed “therapeutic benefits” of a compliant woman? Are there no lonely, disabled, or socially awkward women on this planet? What is not being acknowledged here is that what men who buy sex dolls or prostituted women desire is not companionship, but dominance. McMullen is insulted by the comparison to prostitution, and attempts to turn this point around on Kleeman, as though she is insulting women by making the comparison. “This is not a toy to me, this is the actual hard work of people who have PhDs,” he says. “And to denigrate it down to its simplest form of a sex object is similar to saying that about a woman.” But to compare sex dolls or robots to women is not at all farfetched. The men who want sex dolls literally do want to use them as a replacement for real women. “If my RealDoll could cook, clean, and screw whenever I wanted, I’d never date again,” one man wrote in a sex doll forum. A man Kleeman meets in Detroit calls one of his dolls his “wife,” and has stopped dating now that he’s found his perfect match. The fact that the arguments in favour of sex robots are exactly the same as those in favour of pornography and prostitution — including “men have needs” and “this will probably stop guys from raping women,” as one real-life robot model told Kleeman — is revealing. Noel Aguila, who works for his half-brother’s company, Android Love Dolls, says sex dolls could prevent men from abusing their wives, for example. The message is that men have to have access to a female (or female-like) subordinate in order to truly be complete, as men. In other words, as women gain independence, there must be a stand-in, in order to preserve the hierarchy — in order to preserve masculinity itself. Sex robots don’t undo the violence or domination, they simply normalize it. It is irrational to believe that offering men something that physically looks like a woman — that men are encouraged to engage with as they would a woman — to beat up or rape will discourage men from thinking of women as objects upon which they can act out violent fantasies or project their anger onto. As we know, the existence of hundreds of thousands of prostituted women around the world and a billion dollar porn industry has not stopped rape or abuse. The sex trade itself functions as a system of paid, condoned rape, wherein men get what they want from women who must comply in order to survive, who don’t desire them, and are left traumatized, abused, and worse. That capitalist patriarchy has created a class of people for men’s use and abuse has not deterred them from raping or abusing women who aren’t prostituted, in any case. The solution to men’s violence is not to offer up even more female bodies for men to treat as inhuman. It is not to create replicas of women who don’t talk back, don’t have needs, don’t feel pain when abused, and who exist only to support the male ego. If objectification resolved male violence, we’d be home free by now. No matter what creators and fans claim about the harmlessness or social good of sex robots, they project very clear beliefs about what men deserve and what women are for. The message is that sex is a thing men get from women or do to women, not a thing to be mutually enjoyed by two people. It is not a thing that demands care, compassion, respect, or empathy. Likewise, advocates of sex robots present “companionship” as a one-way street for men — challenges, disagreements, feelings, and thoughts are not valuable or desired qualities in a woman. “Companionship,” in this context, simply means male satisfaction. In other words, sex robots offer men the perfect solution to the feminist movement: If you won’t comply, we’ll create women who do. The dream girl is, as always, not fully human.  Thats so fucking creepy! :-(   “If you don’t comply, we’ll create women who do.”   Hmm what does that sound like    if it wasn’t about men wanting women who are totally complacent, they wouldn’t have designed them to simulate women as much as possible while still being desirable to misogynists. they wouldn’t perform the illusion of emotional labor if it wasn’t about men fundamentally hating women and craving their subjugation whilst simultaneously liking it best when the women in question act like they crave their subjugation as well.  there’s so many things i could say but why? i’ll just leave this here for everyone else to read. Its all there for you." False link

Carol’s daughter is no longer black owned?? Wow. A lot of shit makes sense now.  This is actually very good to know  For all my naturals!  I thought Bronner Bros. owned African Pride…are they no longer Black-owned?  Bronner brothers never owned African pride. They owned African Royale, African pride was created by white people to compete. Here is a link to an excerpt to my favorite book about black hair that goes into detail about it. But short story, no, like my list says african pride is not black owned. And it’s actually a pretty interesting story, considering the white company started going around suing black owned companies with the word africa in it because they believed that they somehow owned it and did not want any competition.  WHAT ABOUT CANTU YALL  Cantu is white owned  WHAT ABOUT CREAM OF NATURE?  ^^ White owned too  Mizani and soft sheen carson?  both used to be Black owned, now they are both owned by L'oreal…so white owned " False link

The idea came from a series of tweets stemming from a 2014 photo of the ladies sitting side-by-side at a Miu Miu show. A Twitter user captioned the photo, “Rihanna looks like she scams rich white men and Lupita is the computer smart best friend that helps plan the scams,” and the internet went wild with calls for the film to be created. “I was texting with these sisters today, and there were some interesting conversations. So we’ll see what comes,” DuVernay said Monday night during Conversations on Creativity with Questlove hosted at Pratt Institute. My twitter feed is in shambles,“ DuVernay said. “I can’t even retweet anymore. It’s so many people over the last four days inundating me with it. It just feels nice like, ‘they like me, they picked me.’” “But also, I think the main thing is the idea that the people want a certain kind of film. People want Black women in centered, powerful images that are complex and layered. And that have nuance beyond what we’re relegated to. And they want it from other Black women. They chose Black writers, with Issa. Issa text me like, ‘Yooo!’ She’s on the set of Insecure trying to be insecure. And all this great stuff is happening.”  “So it just feels like, wow, this is a moment of Black women centered-ness. It’s an indicator of this voice is valid and it should be amplified. And so, I accept it as that.”   Make it happen yo🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾  Yes!!!  " False link
