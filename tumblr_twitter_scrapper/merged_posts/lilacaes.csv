The confusion and anxiety started when I was first born; my parents were both in tears, and all of the doctors offered their condolences.The next day, I was alive and well, much to the confusion of everyone involved. Maybe it was a mistake? Or I would die the next day instead.But I kept living.My parents taught me to hide it, to lie about it. I always covered the tattoo up with long sleeves or ‘bandages’ during the summer. My mother had panic attacks regularly and rarely slept. My father insisted on always knowing where I was going, and constantly checked up on me. I was never left alone.Eventually, when I was old enough to understand what the tattoo meant, and what death was, the anxiety hit me too. I was constantly worried, sometimes staring at the words late at night when I was alone in bed. It didn’t make any sense to me. It didn’t make sense to anyone. But my family and I had come to the agreement that under no circumstances was anyone to find out what the word on my arm really was.Throughout the years of my life, the anxiety would come and go - why would I die now? But moments of fear still passed through me whenever I got into a car, or a friend dared me to go on a roller coaster. Some people called me a coward. I wasn’t a coward - I was confused. I was just trying to live.A part of me knew I should be grateful, grateful for living so long for no justified reason. But I was too confused to care.That is, until one day in my philosophy class, when we started discussing famous phrases and the meanings behind them. Class was normal - a little dull, a little quiet, but interesting enough.Phrases entered and exited the discussion, and I occasionally listened to the discussion. About ten minutes before we were suppose to leave, the professor asked for one last phrase. A girl behind me raised her hand.“Yes? What’s your phrase?”“My phrase is ‘tomorrow never comes.’”Those words hit me, consumed me, making me struggle to breath. Class went on as normal as I sat there, making sense of the words. How had I never heard that phrase before? I suppose my parents protected me from it. But how? It seems like a simple phrase that could be thrown around without anyone making much out of it. But then again, I suppose there’s really not many opportunities to use it.Tomorrow never comes.Tomorrow never comes.Tomorrow never comes.What did that mean for me?I sat through the rest of my classes, thinking and barely acknowledging my lessons, eventually reaching the end of the school day. I reached into my pocket, pulled out my phone, and went to text my dad the news. The statement. But as I typed the words, the realization hit me. Everyone else had dates written on their arm. Dates like “September 17, 2068.” Or “August 23, 2100.” But tomorrow isn’t a date. Tomorrow isn’t a date.“Tomorrow never comes.”I’m immortal. " False text

During a speech to Muslims in Saudi Arabia, Trump referred to “Islamic extremism” instead of “Islamist extremism,” as had been written. While that may sound like a distinction without a difference, Reuters explains: The term “Islamist extremism” refers to Islamism as a political movement rather than Islam as a religion, a distinction that the Republican president had frequently criticized the administration of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, for making. Trump often referred to “Islamic extremism” and criticized President Obama for using the term “Islamist extremism.” But, because he is playing nicey-nicey with the Saudis, he tried to modulate his rhetoric, but he failed. His apparent exhaustion put him right back into campaign mode. That wasn’t the only symptom of his exhaustion. Following the speech, Trump was supposed to appear at the Tweeps Forum. Instead, he sent his daughter Ivanka. Trump is 70-years-old. His diet consists of chocolate cake, double scoops of ice cream on top of a cream pie, Kentucky Fried Chicken (and other fast food) and well-done steak with ketchup. As for exercise, well, he doesn’t. He thinks exercise kills people. You’d think he would be able to handle his nine-day trip. He claims he only needs three to four hours sleep a night.  It’s understandable that a man of his age and his fitness level would have trouble keeping up with the rigors of such an ambitious trip, but one can’t help but note the hypocrisy, especially after saying this about Hillary Clinton:“To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina,” Trump said in the first presidential debate. “You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals … with Japan, with Saudi Arabia.”  Source: Washington Examiner Trump is just one country in and he’s exhausted.  Three days into the trip.  Also  is daughter should never be filling in. When a president is sick they don’t have their children do their job they have people whose job it is to step in do it. So ignoring for the moment that he shouldn’t even be exhausted and if he really is too fucking bad, his kid shouldn’t be doing the job of the president. " False link

So angry. Listen to me. I do not care whether or not you believe vaccines cause autism. Even though studies have shown time and time again that vaccines don’t cause autism and the original study stating that there was a link with autism and vaccines was fraudulent, it does not matter. The reason that people are concerned about vaccines causing autism is because they’re not thinking of the long-term. Here’s the truth: when you are choosing to not having your child vaccinated because you’re afraid of autism, you are actively choosing death over a neurodevelopmental disorder. Let me phrase that in another way – you are either picking autism or death. It doesn’t have to be the death of your child. It can be literally any child. And death is the worst case scenario. Autism is not the worst case scenario. Death is always and will constantly be the worst case scenario. There are children who are too young to get vaccines. There are kids who have compromised immune systems that cannot get vaccines. Your child getting vaccinated prevents these illnesses from spreading and keeps those children safe. It’s called community immunity and it’s important to maintain that so people don’t die. tl;dr - Stop being a selfish asshole and get your kids vaccinated. There are worse things in the world than autism. And before anyone starts coming to my inbox screaming about how “I don’t know how bad autism can be”, I know. Not only do I have a neurodevelopmental disorder, but I also had a friend with a severely autistic brother that could not talk when he was fifteen. I know. And even after witnessing him and being through my own shit, I would still get my kids vaccinated because I want them, and other kids, to live.  WTF, people. Why the fuck do you think that your fear of autism (ungrounded, btw), beats someone else’s RIGHT TO LIVE?!?! You don’t want to vaccinate your kid. Goody gumdrops. You expose your godchild - who’s too young to be vaccinated. You expose your sister-in-law - who is going through chemo (because having cancer isn’t bad enough), and immunocompromised. You expose everyone they come in contact with - BECAUSE MEASLES STAYS ACTIVE FOR UP TO TWO HOURS ON SURFACES AND IN THE AIR OF A SPACE. Number of people killed by symptoms associated with autism diagnoses: 0. Number of people killed by measles in 2015: 134,000 Number of people killed per annum before vaccination became widespread in 1980: 2,600,000 (paraphrased from WHO).

Researchers noticed that after the measles vaccine came out, kids started dying less from other diseases as well.
