The allegations were made by a Russian newspaper and human rights campaigners. “In Chechnya, the command was given for a ‘prophylactic sweep’ and it went as far as real murders,” independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta claimed. […]Speaking to the MailOnline, Svetlana Zakharova from the Russian LGBT network, said:  “Gay people have been detained and rounded up and we are working to evacuate people from the camps and some have now left the region.“Those who have escaped said they are detained in the same room and people are kept altogether, around 30 or 40. They are tortured with electric currents and heavily beaten, sometimes to death.”I don’t have words. Amnesty International is circulating a petition seeking justice. Hold these people in your hearts. Truly, I’m speechless. UPDATE: I’m told the Russian LGBT Network is collecting donations here to help evacuate LGBTQ people from the area and support the survivors.
