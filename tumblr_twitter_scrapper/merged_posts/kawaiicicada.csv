She mistakes him for her gothic-phase teenage grandson and takes care of him. The demon decides to stay at his new home. It isn‚Äôt uncommon for this particular demon to be summoned‚Äîfrom exhausting Halloween party pranks in abandoned barns to more legitimate (more exhausting) ceremonies in forests‚Äîbut it has to admit, this is the first time it‚Äôs been called forth from its realm into a claustrophobic living room bathed in the dull orange-pink glow of old glass lamps and a multitude of wide-eyed, creepy antique porcelain dolls that could give Chucky a run for his money with all of their silent, seething stares combined. Accompanying those oddities are tea cup and saucer sets on shelves atop frilly doilies crocheted with the utmost care, and cross-stitched, colorful ‚ÄòHome Sweet Home‚Äôs hung across the wood-paneled walls. It‚Äôs a mistake‚Äîa wrong number, per se. No witch it‚Äôs ever known has lived in such an, ah, dated, home. Furthermore, no practitioner that ever summoned it has been absent, as if they‚Äôd up and ding-dong ditched it. No, it didn‚Äôt work that way. Not at all. Not if they want to survive the encounter. It hears the clinking of movement in the room adjacent‚Äîthe kitchen, going by the pungent, bitter scent of cooled coffee and soggy, sweet sponge cakes, but more jarring is the smell of blood. It moves‚Äîfeels something slip beneath its clawed foot as it does, and sees a crocheted blanket of whites and greys and deep black yarn, wound intricately, perfectly, into a summoning circle. Its summoning circle. There is a small splash of bright scarlet and sharp, jagged bits of a broken curio scattered on top, as if someone had dropped it, attempted to pick it up the pieces and pricked their finger. It would explain the blood. And it would explain the demon being brought into this strange place.  As it connects these pieces in its mind, the inhabitant of the house rounds the corner and exits the kitchen, holding a damp, white dish towel close to her hand and fumbling with the beaded bifocals hanging from her neck by a crocheted lanyard before stopping dead in her tracks.  Now, to be fair, the demon wouldn‚Äôt ordinarily second guess being face-to-face with a hunchbacked crone with a beaked nose, beady eyes and a peculiar lack of teeth, or a spidery shawl and ankle-length black dress, but there is definitely something amiss here. Especially when the old biddy lets her spectacles fall slack on her bosom and erupts into a wide, toothy (toothless) grin, eyes squinting and crinkling from the sheer effort of it.  ‚ÄúTodd! Todd, dear, I didn‚Äôt know you were visiting this year! You didn‚Äôt call, you didn‚Äôt write‚Äîbut, oh, I‚Äôm so happy you‚Äôre here, dear! Would it have been too much to ask you to ring the doorbell? I almost had a heart attack. And don‚Äôt worry about the blood, here‚ÄîI had an accident. My favorite figure toppled off of the table and cleanup didn‚Äôt go as expected. But I seem to recall you are quite into the bloodshed and ‚Äòedgy‚Äô stuff these days, so I don‚Äôt suppose you mind.‚Äù She releases a hearty, kind laugh, but it isn‚Äôt mocking, it‚Äôs sweet. Grandmotherly. The demon is by no means sentimental or maudlin, but the kindness, the familiarity, the genuine fondness, does pull a few dusty old nostalgic heartstrings. ‚ÄúImagine if it leaves a scar! It‚Äôd be a bit ‚Äòbadass,‚Äô as you teenagers say, wouldn‚Äôt it?‚Äù She is as blind as a bat without her glasses, it would appear, because the demon is by no means a ‚ÄòTodd‚Äô or a human at all, though humanoid, shrouded in sleek, black skin and hard spikes and sharp claws. But the demon humors her, if only because it had been caught off guard.  The old woman smiles still, before turning on her heel and shuffling into the hallway with a stiff gait revealing a poor hip. ‚ÄúBe a dear and make some more coffee, would you please? I‚Äôll be back in a jiffy.‚Äù Yes, this is most definitely a mistake. One for the record books, for certain. For late-night trips to bars and conversations with colleagues, while others discuss how many souls they‚Äôd swindled in exchange for peanuts, or how many first-borns they‚Äôd been pledged for things idiot humans could have gained without divine intervention. Ugh. Sometimes it all just became so pedantic that little detours like this were a blessing‚Äîhappy accidents, as the humans would say.  That‚Äôs why the demon does as asked, and plods slowly into the kitchen, careful to duck low and avoid the top of the doorframe. That‚Äôs why it gingerly takes the small glass pot and empties it of old, stale coffee and carefully, so carefully, takes a measuring scoop between its claws and fills the machine with fresh grounds. It‚Äôs as the hot water is percolating that the old woman returns, her index finger wrapped tight in a series of beige bandages.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm surprised you‚Äôre so tall, Todd! I haven‚Äôt seen you since you were at my hip! But your mother mails photos all the time‚Äîyou do love wearing all black, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù She takes a seat at the small round table in the corner and taps the glass lid of the cake plate with quaking, unsteady, aged hands. ‚ÄúI was starting to think you‚Äôd never visit. Your father and I have had our disagreements, but‚Ä¶I am glad you‚Äôre here, dear. Would you like some cake?‚Äù Before the demon has a chance to decline, she lifts the lid and cuts a generous slice from the near-complete circle that has scarcely been touched. It smells of citrus and cream and is, as assumed earlier, soggy, oversaturated with icing.  It was made for a special occasion, for guests, but it doesn‚Äôt seem this old woman receives much company in this musty, stagnant house that smells like an antique garage that hadn‚Äôt had its dust stirred in years.  Especially not from her absentee grandson, Todd.  The demon waits until the coffee pot is full, and takes two small mugs from the counter, filling them until steam is frothing over the rims. Then, and only then, does it accept the cake and sit, with some difficulty, in a small chair at the small table. It warbles out a polite ‚Äòthank you,‚Äô but it doesn‚Äôt suppose the woman understands. Manners are manners regardless. ‚ÄúOh, dear, I can hardly understand. Your voice has gotten so deep, just like your grandfather‚Äôs was. That, and I do recall you have an affinity for that gravelly, screaming music. Did your voice get strained? It‚Äôs alright, dear, I‚Äôll do the talking. You just rest up. The coffee will help soothe.‚Äù The demon merely nods‚Äîsome communication can be understood without fail‚Äîand drinks the coffee and eats the cake with a too-small fork. It‚Äôs ordinary, mushy, but delicious because of the intent behind it and the love that must have gone into its creation.  ‚ÄúI hope you enjoyed all of the presents I sent you. You never write back‚Äîbut I am aware most people use that fancy E-mail these days. I just can‚Äôt wrap my head around it. I do wish your mom and dad would visit sometime. I know of a wonderful little caf√© down the street we can go to. I haven‚Äôt been; I wanted to visit it with Charles, before he‚Ä¶well.‚Äù She falls silent in her rambling, staring into her coffee with a small, melancholy smile. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs been ten years. You never had the chance to meet him. But never mind that.‚Äù Suddenly, and with surprising speed that has the demon concerned for her well being, she moves to her feet, bracing her hands on the edge of the table. ‚ÄúI may as well give you your birthday present, since you‚Äôre here. What timing! I only finished it this morning. I‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù When she returns, the white, grey and black crocheted work with the summoning circle is bundled in her arms. ¬† ‚ÄúI found these designs in an occult book I borrowed from the library. I thought you‚Äôd like them on a nice, warm blanket to fight off the winter chill‚ÄîI hope you do like it.‚Äù With gentle hands, she spreads the blanket over the demon‚Äôs broad, spiky back like a shawl, smoothing it over craggy shoulders and patting its arms affectionately. ‚ÄúHappy birthday, Todd, dear.‚Äù Well, that settles it. Whoever, wherever, Todd is, he‚Äôs clearly missing out. The demon will just have to be her grandson from now on.  this is so sweet. it made me want to hug someone.  i had to  I WOULD WATCH SIX SEASONS AND A MOVIE  Okay but she takes him to the little cafe and all of the people in her town are like ‚ÄúWhat is that thing, what the hell, Anette?‚Äù and she‚Äôs like ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you remember my grandson Todd?‚Äù and the entire town just has to play along because no one will tell little old Nettie that her grandson is an actual demon because this is the happiest she‚Äôs been since her husband died.  Bonus: In season 4 she makes him run for mayor and he wins  I just want to watch¬†‚ÄòTodd‚Äô help her with groceries, and help her with cooking, and help her clean up the dust around the house and air it out, and fill it with spring flowers because Anette mentioned she loved hyacinth and daffodils.¬†Over the seasons her eyesight worsens, so¬†‚ÄòTodd‚Äô brings a hellhound into the house to act as her seeing eye dog, and people in town are kinda terrified of this massive black brute with fur that drips like thick oil, and a mouth that can open all the way back to its chest, but¬†‚ÄòHoney‚Äô likes her hard candies, and doesn‚Äôt get oil on the carpet, and when¬†‚ÄòTodd‚Äô has to go back to Hell for errands, Honey will snuggle up to Anette and rest his giant head on her lap, and whuff at her pockets for butterscotch.¬†Anette never gives¬†‚ÄòTodd‚Äô her soul, but she gives him her heart  In season six, Anette gets sick. She spends most of the season bedridden and it becomes obvious by about midway through the season that she‚Äôs not going to make it to the end of the season. Todd spends the season travelling back and forth between the human realm and his home plane, trying hard to find something, anything that will help Anette get better, to prolong her life. He‚Äôs tried getting her to sell him her soul, but she‚Äôs just laughed, told him that he shouldn‚Äôt talk like that.With only a few episodes left in the season Anette passes away, Todd is by her side. When the reaper comes for her Todd asks about the fate of her soul. In a dispassionate voice the reaper informs Todd that Anette spent the last few years of her life cavorting with creatures of darkness, that there can be only one fate for her. Todd refuses to accept this and he fights the reaper, eventually injuring the creature and driving it off. Knowing that Anette cannot stay in the Human Realm, and refusing to allow her spirit to be taken by another reaper, so he takes her soul in his arms. He‚Äôs done this before, when mortals have sold themselves to him. This time the soul cradled against his chest does not snuggle and fight. This time the soul held tight against him reaches out, pats him on the cheek tells him he was a good boy, and so handsome, just like his grandfather.¬†Todd takes Anette back to the demon realm, holding her tight against him as he travels across the bleak and forebidding landscape; such a sharp contrast to the rosy warmth of Anette‚Äôs home. Eventually, in a far corner of his home plane, Todd finds what he is looking for. It is a place where other demons do not tread; a large boulder cracked and broken, with a gap just barely large enough for Todd to fit through. This crack, of all things, gives him pause, but Anette‚Äôs soul makes a comment about needing to get home in time to feed Honey, and Todd forces himself to pass through it. He travels in darkness for a while, before he emerges into into a light so bright that it‚Äôs blinding. His eyes adjust slowly, and he finds himself face to face with two creatures, each of them at least twice his size one of them has six wings and the head of a lion, one of them is an amorphous creature within several rings. The lion-headed one snarls at Todd, and demands that he turn back, that he has no business here.¬†Todd looks down, holding Anette‚Äôs soul against his chest, he takes a deep breath, and speaks a single word,¬†‚ÄúPlease.‚ÄùThe two larger beings are taken aback by this. They are too used to Todd‚Äôs kind being belligerent, they consult with each other, they argue. The amorphous one seems to want to be lenient, the lion-headed one insists on being stricter. While they‚Äôre arguing Todd sneaks by them and runs as fast as he can, deeper into the brightly lit expanse. The path on which he travels begins to slope upwards, and eventually becomes a staircase. It becomes evident that each step further up the stair is more and more difficult for Todd, that it‚Äôs physically paining him to climb these stairs, but he keeps going. They dedicate a full episode to this climb; interspersing the climb with scenes they weren‚Äôt able to show in previous seasons, Anette and Honey coming to visit Todd in the Mayor‚Äôs office, Anette and Todd playing bingo together for the first time, Anette and Todd watching their stories together in the mid afternoon, Anette falling asleep in her chair and Todd gently carrying her to bed. Anette making Todd lemonade in the summer while he‚Äôs up on the roof fixing that leak and cleaning out the rain gutters. Eventually Todd reaches the top, and all but collapses, he falls to a knee and for the first time his grip on Anette‚Äôs soul slips, and she falls away from him. Landing on the ground.He reaches out for her, but someone gets there first. Another hand reaches out, and helps this elderly woman off the ground, helps her get to her feet. Anette gasps, it‚Äôs Charles. The pair of them throw their arms around each other. Anette tells Charles that she‚Äôs missed him so much, and she has so much to tell him. Charles nods. Todd watches a soft smile on his face. A delicate hand touches Todd‚Äôs shoulder, and pulls him easily to his feet. A figure; we never see exactly what it looks like, leans down, whispering in Todd‚Äôs ear that he‚Äôs done well, and that Anette will be well taken care of here. That she will spend an eternity with her loved ones. Todd looks back over to her, she‚Äôs surrounded by a sea of people. Todd nods, and smiles. The figure behind him tells him that while he has done good in bringing Anette here, this is not his place, and he must leave. Todd nods, he knew this would be the case.Todd gets about six steps down the stairway before he is stopped by someone grabbing his shoulder again. He turns around, and Anette is standing behind him. She gives him a big hug and leads him back up the stairs, he should stay, she says. Get to know the family. Todd tries to tell her that he can‚Äôt stay, but she won‚Äôt hear it. She leads him up into the crowd of people and begins introducing him to long dead relatives of hers, all of whom give him skeptical looks when she introduces him as her grandson. The mysterious figure appears next to Todd again and tells him once more he must leave, Todd opens his mouth to answer but Anette cuts him off. Nonsense, she tells the figure. IF she‚Äôs gonna stay here forever her grandson will be welcome to visit her. She and the figure stare at each other for a moment. The figure eventually sighs and looks away, the figure asks Todd if she‚Äôs always like this. Todd just shrugs and smiles, allowing Anette to lead him through a pair of pearly gates, she‚Äôs already talking about how much cake they‚Äôll need to feed all of these relatives.¬†   P.S. Honey is a Good Dog and gets to go, too.   the last lines of the show: demon: you‚Äôre not blind here ‚Äì but you‚Äôre not surprised. when‚Ä¶? anette: oh, toddy, don‚Äôt be silly, my biological grandson‚Äôs not twelve feet tall and doesn‚Äôt scorch the furniture when he sneezes. i‚Äôve known for ages. demon: then why? anette: you wouldn‚Äôt have stayed if you weren‚Äôt lonely too. demon: you‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt have to keep calling me your grandson. anette: nonsense! adopted children are just as real. now quit sniffling, you silly boy, and let‚Äôs go bake a cake. honey, heel! honey: WÃΩÃÇÃøÕÇÕùÃùOÃãÕ¶Ã£ÃÆÃπÕÖÃ≤Ã™OÕäÃ∏ÃòÕîÃ¨FÃãÕ´ÕåÕóÃúÃ´ÕôÃüÕïÕñÃô  that addition is a+ :)  THE ONLY ENDING I WILL EVER ACCEPT FOR THIS     Thanks Satan.   @snarksassandalittlecrass  WHY AM I CRYING " False text

Minors are often some of the world‚Äôs most inexperienced people. They tend to have very narrow, self-centered views of society and those around them. That isn‚Äôt to say minors are stupid or that all minors are ignorant; it‚Äôs just that they almost always lack the experience and years of education older folks possess. Adults calling a minor‚Äôs bigoted views bigoted isn‚Äôt a bad thing. Kids won‚Äôt know they‚Äôre wrong if no one tells them. I don‚Äôt handle teens very well, especially not the pompous know-it-all kind, and I won‚Äôt pretend that I‚Äôm a stellar educator‚Äìbut me, as an adult with knowledge and experience kids cannot possibly possess, calling out ignorance isn‚Äôt some great evil. It‚Äôs just me telling a kid they‚Äôre wrong and hoping they grow to be less wrong. No one is exempt from bigotry. No one gets a free pass. If you‚Äôre wrong, I will say you‚Äôre wrong. " False text

Under the cover of  night and without a permit, he installed his massive Charging Bull  directly before the New York Stock Exchange, a gift New Yorkers loved  but New York City initially hated. Authorities removed it, but later  reinstalled it under pressure at a small public park in the financial  district. In the 18 years since, it has become an institution. Then last month, on International Women‚Äôs Day,  a new statue of a symbolically brave Fearless Girl stole its spotlight  ‚Äî and, Di Modica says, fundamentally corrupted the artistic integrity of  his Charging Bull. As Fearless Girl was heralded by many as a symbol for female  empowerment, Di Modica doled out sharp criticism, casting the statue as  not art, but a publicity stunt by the gender-oriented company that  commissioned it. He forcefully advocated against a global  campaign to make Fearless Girl a permanent fixture, but fans  persevered, persuading New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio to extend the statue‚Äôs permit through April 2018. On behalf of his bull, Di Modica won‚Äôt back down. The  artist held a news conference Wednesday with attorney Norman Siegel,  the former director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, to ask the  city to move Fearless Girl. He said says New York City is violating his  legal rights by forcing his bronze beast to face off against the girl  statue. While  Di Modica says the bull‚Äôs message is supposed to be ‚Äúfreedom in the  world, peace, strength, power and love,‚Äù his lawyers say Fearless Girl  exploits the bull for commercial purposes. They want it moved and are  hoping for an amicable solution. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all for gender  equality,‚Äù Siegel told The Washington Post Tuesday night. ‚ÄúBut the  questions are because there are other issues.‚Äù The  specific issues, Siegel told the Post, will be saved for the news  conference, though he said they do not intend to file any lawsuits  Wednesday.‚Äù  Any artists out there take note of this, let‚Äôs see how they decide to treat an artists statement and the integrity of their work.¬† Or will progressiveness win out in the face of all good judgement when it comes to artistic integrity like when they broke the genitalia off of statues so many years ago.
