As Rutan explained it to me, if the breakthrough idea wasn’t considered “crazy” just a few days ago, then it’s not a true breakthrough. A computer that is 10% or 20% faster is predictable and incremental.   Going from vacuum tubes to silicon for computation, on the other hand, is a real breakthrough. This mantra fueled me to push past the criticism for many of my own crazy ideas. To ignore the many “experts” who said it couldn’t be done, and ultimately to bend reality toward the future I passionately desired. If I had to name my superpower, it would be persistence (or grit) — i.e. not giving up, even when everyone is telling me that it isn’t going to work. In reality, many of my successes have taken me 10 years or more to implement.   Here are a couple of stories: Zero-G: In 1993, I wanted to fly on NASA’s zero-g (KC-135) plane used to simulate weightlessness and train NASA’s astronauts. As much as I tried, NASA turned me down. My response was, “Okay, screw it. If I want to experience it that much, I bet others do as well… I’ll start a zero-g company myself.” So I did. Along with my co-founders – astronaut Byron Lichtenberg and NASA scientist Ray Cronise – I became CEO of a company called Zero Gravity Corporation, or Zero-G. Back in May 1993 we had our first meeting with the FAA. Their response? “YOU WANT TO DO WHAT? My answer: “Put 36 people in an airplane, take off their seat belts, put the plane into a parabolic maneuver, 50 degrees nose up, over the top, and then 50 degrees nose down, where they can float in the center of the cabin for 30 seconds.” This is where my passion hit a bureaucratic decade-long brick wall. It took us 11 years of constant pressure, hard work, and outlasting bureaucrats to become operational, which finally happened in September of 2004. Since then, I’m proud to say that we’ve flown over 20,000 people ranging from age 7 to 93, including Professor Stephen Hawking and wheelchair-bound children, into weightlessness. You can book your flight here: www.GoZeroG.com. XPRIZE Foundation: I first read Charles Lindbergh’s book, Spirit of St. Louis, in December 1993. I learned that Lindbergh flew from New York to Paris in 1927 to win a $25,000 prize. It was that leverage and efficiency of an incentive prize that led me to propose the idea of a $10 million purse for the first person to build and fly a reusable private spaceship carrying three people into space on two flights within two weeks. In May of 1996, without the prize money in hand, I went onstage under the St. Louis Arch and announced the $10 million XPRIZE anyway. I thought (mistakenly) that someone would quickly fund the $10 million prize purse. After all, you didn’t pay out the prize money until after a team had successfully completed both flights. Between 1996 and 2001, I pitched 150+ sponsors, and received 150 “no’s”. Finally (long story) in 2002, I met the Ansari family, who ultimately funded the $10 million purse (we named it the Ansari XPRIZE in their honor). Two years later on October 4, 2004, the XPRIZE was won. It took 12 years, from concept to Prize Award… Once again, this was a tale about grit, persistence and making my own luck. Today, as the XPRIZE Foundation is hitting its stride, the Foundation is now 24 years old with over $300 million in awarded, funded and/or designed XPRIZEs. Two Questions for You: I have two questions for you… Where in your organization do you allow crazy ideas to be funded and attempted? If that doesn’t exist, have you committed yourself to only pursuing incremental improvement? Or do you plan to buy your innovation from the outside world? What do you believe in strongly enough that you will dedicate a decade to its pursuit, and be able to withstand 150 ‘no’s’? At the end of the day, the formula for a true breakthrough is equal to “having a crazy idea” you believe in plus the passion to pursue that idea against all naysayers and obstacles.

(Yum?) To put this not-so-eloquently, Earth’s ecosystems are like grandma’s famous pancakes: her recipe, when followed correctly, produces the fluffiest, tastiest, most golden-brown pancakes of anyone in town. That’s where Earth’s ecosystems have been for millions of years. Before her recipe—that is, before Earth had stable ecosystems—too little or not all of the ingredients existed to make that perfect batter. No matter how hard you tried, it couldn’t be done. Now imagine grandma’s recipe was so good that your family opened a restaurant. For years, it was the talk of the town. Now you’ve taken over, but other breakfast restaurants have opened in recent years, and some of them serve breakfast food 24/7.  To stay in business, you’ve adopted a new strategy: you turn off your water supply and every day, customers bring their own water to help you save money for better advertising. Today, you have all the ingredients to serve 1,000 people. All your customers come in, and one by one, you add their water to the mixture—the mixture that everyone is eating from, mind you. At first, as you’re adding water to the mixture, it all seems to be going fine. It’s almost to the right consistency when you get a phone call, so you step away. While you’re gone, everyone in line pays your assistant, who is lazy and just lets whoever brought water dump it in the batter…without filtering it. Worse yet, some people didn’t measure how much water they actually had; they just filled glasses of different sizes and dumped them in. When you get back from your phone call, you look inside the vat and see that the batter is soupy, watered-down, and has dust and dirt from people’s unfiltered water. But it’s too late now. Most people are sitting at tables, eagerly waiting for their stack of grandma’s famous pancakes. There are a few people left in line waiting to pay, and a few of them brought glasses of water. In anger, you take their money, but tell them to dump their water in a flower pot and go sit down. To compensate for the soupy batter, you cook the pancakes longer than grandma’s recipe says to, hoping the excess water will cook out and save the pancakes. But no: they spread out until they’re thin as paper. So you turn up the heat—and the pancakes start to burn. Outside, people are getting restless. They paid good money for grandma’s famous pancakes, and they all have places to be and things to do. Several of them come back to the kitchen to ask what’s taking so long, only to see you scrambling around and yelling at your assistant for being so negligent. When the small band of customers asks what’s going on, you angrily tell them the pancakes will be out soon. Unconvinced, the customers go back to the dining room and explain what they saw. Some of the first-time customers leave; they like the other restaurants anyway. The long-time customers—those who have been loyal for years—refuse to believe that the pancakes could be ruined, and tell other customers how grandma’s pancakes are the best they’ve ever had, and how, if people leave, they will never find better pancakes anywhere in the world, ever. The customers who witnessed the chaos in the kitchen argue with the long-time customers, but are called out as liars who are trying to promote competing restaurants. In the confusion, some undecided customers peek inside the kitchen, see the chaos, and sneak out of the restaurant. One stays behind and manages to convince a few loyalists to go see the chaos in the kitchen for themselves. Those who refuse, say, “We’ve never gone back to see it before, and the pancakes always come out fine. Why should this be any different?” By this time, you have managed to produce a couple good-looking pancakes and threw them on top of the pile to cover them up the terrible ones. Still, a majority are coming out ruined, and there’s no way you’re going to feed everyone in the restaurant. Then the door opens, and a few of your most loyal customers see the good-looking pancakes you threw on top. You just smile and assure them their pancakes will be out soon. Some, however, notice you covering up the burnt and watered-down pancakes, and leave the restaurant. Some switch sides and say the restaurant is clearly failing and needs to be shut down, while others say that nothing like this will ever happen again. When you finally manage to cook a few dozen good pancakes and several hundred bad-but-edible ones, you roll them out to the dining room—only to see that, of the 1,000 people who were in your restaurant this morning, a mere 300 remain. You force yourself to smile and start serving them. Only the first ten customers get the best pancakes of the batch, and don’t notice the ruined ones underneath, and promise to bring even more water the next day to compensate for the idiots who walked out. They go on eating breakfast happily, their consciences clear. But then the best pancakes are gone, and other customers pick at their pancakes in disgust, or throw them in the trash, refusing to accept the pancakes at all. And when all the pancakes are gone, there are still 100 people who haven’t been served at all, and demand refunds, or storm out and vow never to eat at your restaurant again. The point of the story is this: fossil fuels were once the best-of-the-best. Yes, they provided the foundation society needed to get its feet off the ground, but then they got too big, and started doing long-term damages. Some people turned to more sustainable energies and grew their own niche markets that provided energies around-the-clock, which was attractive to an even larger market. Now that fossil fuels are being proven to have adverse effects on Earth’s ecosystems, people are switching to the sustainable resources, which are becoming cheaper and more abundant every day. Only the loyalists, the people who have been in the business their entire lives, refuse to see what’s going on behind the scenes and keep supplying the necessary economic resources. Only by educating the general public, showing them the damages for themselves, and converting them to cleaner, ever-cheapening, and near-infinite energy sources can we begin to heal Earth’s damaged ecosystems. “But it’s tradition” is no longer a valid excuse. There will always be a better recipe. " False text

Getting a good night’s sleep after learning something new seems to help you remember it later, whether it is a new motor skill (like a series of repetitive movements) or a new cognitive skill (like memorizing a poem). The way the brain processes and stores these two types of learning (implicit or explicit) is important to understanding how our brains work with implications for learning, education, and the treatment of diseases involving memory loss. Knowing that sleep plays a role in all of this is one thing. Understanding exactly how this happens in the brain is another. New research from Edwin Robertson at the University of Glasgow and Jocelyn Breton at the University of California, Berkeley helps clarify the role sleep plays in these two different types of learning. Participants in the study were asked to play a game like the electronic memory game Simon. They had to push a button on a keyboard that corresponded to one of 4 possible positions of a circle on their screen. All participants received the same 12-item long repeating sequence. In the first group (the explicit learning group), the participants were told that they should try to learn the sequence and were given clues to when the sequence would begin again. In the second group (the implicit learning group) the participants were simply told to push the keys correctly as quickly as possible. The researchers then used a technique called Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) that allows them to temporarily turn off specific neural circuits in the brain to test the role of two circuits in storing the sequence in the brain. After a night of sleep, the participants were then tested to recall as much of the sequence as possible. The researchers found that two independent brain circuits mediate the improvement in explicit and implicit learning that typically occurs with sleep. When the participants learned a skill through the repetitive motion alone, the memory was learned through a circuit in the inferior parietal lobe. When they learned by consciously trying to remember the sequences, the learning was stored through a different circuit in the primary motor cortex. This suggests that awareness of learning, even the same sequence, can alter the circuit supporting learning and subsequent memory enhancement over sleep. Overall, the same memory enhancement over a night of sleep can be achieved through different circuits. This work was published this week in Nature Human Behaviour. " False text

Humans affect space, too. We know storms from the sun can naturally change the space environment around Earth, which can have an impact on satellites and power grids. Scientists now know that Cold War era nuclear tests in the 1950s caused similar effects. Particles around Earth are organized into layers known as radiation belts. These 1950s tests created a temporary extra layer of radiation closer to Earth.  The effects of this could be seen all around the world. Aurora appeared at the equator instead of the poles, utility grids in Hawaii were strained, and in some cases, satellites above test sites were affected.  Some types of communications signals can also affect Earth’s radiation belts.  Very low-frequency waves, or VLFs, are used for radio communications. They are often used to communicate with submarines, because these waves can penetrate deep into the ocean.  The waves can also travel far into the space environment around Earth. When these waves are in space, they affect how high-energy particles move, creating a barrier against natural radiation. The outer edge of this radio-wave barrier corresponds almost exactly the inner edge of Earth’s natural radiation belts – meaning it could be human activity that at least partly shapes this natural radiation around Earth.   For more NASA sun and space research, visit www.nasa.gov/sunearth and follow us on Twitter and Facebook.

They can’t help it; it’s just what happens when you have a star that’s heavier than our sun but as small as a city. Neutron stars give us access to crazy conditions that we can’t study directly on Earth. Here are five facts about neutron stars that show sometimes they are stranger than science fiction!  1. Neutron stars start their lives with a bang When a star bigger and more massive than our sun runs out of fuel at the end of its life, its core collapses while the outer layers are blown off in a supernova explosion. What is left behind depends on the mass of the original star. If it’s roughly 7 to 19 times the mass of our sun, we are left with a neutron star. If it started with more than 20 times the mass of our sun, it becomes a black hole. 2. Neutron stars contain the densest material that we can directly observe While neutron stars’ dark cousins, black holes, might get all the attention, neutron stars are actually the densest material that we can directly observe. Black holes are hidden by their event horizon, so we can’t see what’s going on inside. However, neutron stars don’t have such shielding. To get an idea of how dense they are, one sugar cube of neutron star material would weigh about 1 trillion kilograms (or 1 billion tons) on Earth—about as much as a mountain. That is what happens when you cram a star with up to twice the mass of our sun into a sphere the diameter of a city. 3. Neutron stars can spin as fast as blender blades Some neutron stars, called pulsars, emit streams of light that we see as flashes because the beams of light sweep in and out of our vision as the star rotates. The fastest known pulsar, named PSR J1748-2446ad, spins 43,000 times every minute. That’s twice as fast as the typical household blender! Over weeks, months or longer, pulsars pulse with more accuracy than an atomic clock, which excites astronomers about the possible applications of measuring the timing of these pulses. 4. Neutron stars are the strongest known magnets Like many objects in space, including Earth, neutron stars have a magnetic field. While all known neutron stars have magnetic fields billions and trillions of times stronger than Earth’s, a type of neutron star known as a magnetar can have a magnetic field another thousand times stronger. These intense magnetic forces can cause starquakes on the surface of a magnetar, rupturing the star’s crust and producing brilliant flashes of gamma rays so powerful that they have been known to travel thousands of light-years across our Milky Way galaxy, causing measurable changes to Earth’s upper atmosphere. 5. Neutron stars’ pulses were originally thought to be possible alien signals Beep. Beep. Beep. The discovery of pulsars began with a mystery in 1967 when astronomers picked up very regular radio flashes but couldn’t figure out what was causing them. The early researchers toyed briefly with the idea that it could be a signal from an alien civilization, an explanation that was discarded but lingered in their nickname for the original object—LGM-1, a nod to the “little green men” (it was later renamed PSR B1919+21). Of course, now scientists understand that pulsars are spinning neutron stars sending out light across a broad range of wavelengths that we detect as very regular pulses – but the first detections threw observers for a loop. The Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) payload that is soon heading to the International Space Station will give astronomers more insight into neutron stars—helping us determine what is under the surface. Also, onboard NICER, the Station Explorer for X-ray Timing and Navigation Technology (SEXTANT) experiment will test the use of pulsars as navigation beacons in space.

Space weather – which can include changes in Earth’s magnetic environment – are usually triggered by the sun’s activity, but recently declassified data on high-altitude nuclear explosion tests have provided a new look at the mechanisms that set off perturbations in that magnetic system. Such information can help support NASA’s efforts to protect satellites and astronauts from the natural radiation inherent in space. From 1958 to 1962, the U.S. and U.S.S.R. ran high-altitude tests with exotic code names like Starfish, Argus and Teak. The tests have long since ended, and the goals at the time were military. Today, however, they can provide crucial information on how humans can affect space. The tests, and other human-induced space weather, are the focus of a comprehensive new study published in Space Science Reviews. Keep reading " False text

I have read most of his books and watched hours of his videos and learned a lot in the process. There is no doubt that Professor Watts, a philosopher, knew a great deal of the teachings of the Buddha. Yet, he died an early death of acute alcoholism. People who knew him described him as an intensely lonely and sad man. How can this be? You see for Watts the dharma was just an academic study. He did not follow the precepts.  He did not meditate. His is a valuable lesson for us. Knowing and doing are not the same thing. I can read all about fitness and health but if I don’t exercise and eat well all that knowledge is useless. Knowledge, if it is to be anything other than mental gymnastics, must be put into practice. Don’t think for a moment that you are going to read yourself into inner peace. In fact, often students spend their time trying to understand instead of doing the things they are taught. This is why I cringe when people speak of Buddhism as a “philosophy”. There is a great deal of philosophy in the Buddhist tradition but you could know it all and not be an inch closer to accomplishing what the Buddha was trying to convey. The goal, if you can call it that, of Buddhist practice, is to eliminate the fear which we human beings are heir for the simple reason that our intellect allows us to see that we will age, sicken and die. We are afraid of losing that which we cherish all the while knowing that it will happen. Not might happen WILL happen. So far as we “know” we have just this one life. Most people are still just animals concerned with food, shelter, sex and security, They are born asleep, live asleep and die asleep. All the while they live they are haunted by fear. This fear causes them to hate others, covet what they have and to take what they want. Their spirits never rise above the desires of the body. Then as they begin to stir awake they are plagued by doubt and ask “is this all there is?” Asking this is the very first step on the path. " False text

Keep reading  Great read if you aren’t up to speed on what’s going on in the aerospace industry beyond the Mars, Pluto, and Cassini exploration highlights that make it to the mainstream “news” channels. Here’s the skinny: Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Robert Bigelow are all developing aerospace architecture for cargo and crew to the Moon (and in Musk’s case, beyond). Google’s Lunar XPRIZE competition worth a US$30 million purse is being sought for by teams aiming to land a rover on the lunar surface and achieve a variety of milestones. Fuel for rocketry is insanely expensive; in fact, it’s the primary cost of every mission, ever. So, it’d be far more advantageous if we could refuel in space, which will enable the lowering of costs, and open the variety of destinations amidst the space frontier, so to speak. In order to do that, fuel depots are essential.The lunar surface has ice, which can be harvested to produce hydrogen-oxygen propellent. Ice available on the moon is located in dark craters out of reach to sunlight; therefore, options are on the table to develop mirrors to redirect sunlight for solar panels to power energy stations for rovers, bases, mining operations, etc.Propellant manufactured into liquid form on the moon robotically would be transferred to passing spacecraft; ideal for deep space missions. A suite of specialized rovers would carry out tasks essential to the development of propellent collected from the moon via ‘Lunar Resupply Shuttles’ which would rendezvous with their respective spacecraft. NASA is already working on something similar to this in the way of an electrolysis module to melt ice into a liquid to be used for propellant; thus — “fuel depot/”gas” station.  SEP or ‘Solar Electric Propulsion’ in aerospace talk, looks like it will serve the greater future of our spacefaring society beyond simple Light Sail technology, as SEP will allow for the towing of cargo to and from LEO to the L1 point which would serve as a sort of port for larger spacecraft to transfer said cargo to Mars. Obviously, a lunar base (human and robotic) would enable a true spaceport enabling an actual ‘giant leap’ in regards to furthering our presence and our scientific exploration activity amongst the solar system. Without such a development, progress on the spacefaring front would remain stagnant and economically insufficient to escape the terrestrial gravity of politics. " False text

The federal government this week launched its National Science Statement, and much of Sinodinos’ long speech focused on Australia’s science priorities, and the links between science, education and the economy.But while Sinodinos’ address was deep and dense in policy and vision, he gave a prominent place to a notable dig at some of his colleagues who have disputed climate science and the value of vaccinations for children.“Increasingly, there has emerged a lack of respect for the scientific method in some quarters. We see the conclusions of experts being cast aside, in favour of ideological positions and selective use of facts. Denying the threat of climate change is a well-worn example; however, rejecting vaccinations – at the risk of children’s lives and public health – resurfaced just this month. The only credible response to these positions is scientific fact. And more research, and more innovative thinking. This is why innovation and science are more important than ever.”This part of the speech is obviously aimed squarely at One Nation, with Senator Malcolm Roberts focusing much of his time in the federal parliament with disputing climate change data (see here, here, here, here, here and here, among others).The party’s leader Pauline Hanson also recently came under fire for comments about vaccinations; Hanson has previously linked vaccinations to autism, and just this month, said parents should “go out and do their own research with regards to [vaccinations]” because they can “have an effect on some children”.“Eras are so often defined by their scientific advances – and in turn, science is defined by the challenges of the day… Science doesn’t exist in a vacuum, so it’s worth taking a moment to consider the context surrounding science in Australia today. ""To that end, I’d like to start by reflecting on our current economic setting: to define the challenges we all face; and explore the reason why, no matter what industry we work in, innovation and science are indispensable tools in overcoming those challenges.”Continue reading over at HuffPost AU Edition…" True link

It contains the hardware that you need to build an elbow exoskeleton. An accompanying handbook contains a tutorial that will guide you through the different assembly steps. In addition, the handbook provides background information on exoskeleton history, functionality and technology. In the end, you will have a good understanding about exoskeleton technology and its application, together with hands-on experience building and programming your own robotic exoskeleton. Quick Facts: What it is: It is an educational robotics kit that will help you to learn about exoskeleton technology.  It is a do-it-yourself kit that requires your active participation and willingness to learn and try new things. For whom it is: For high school and college students who want to learn about robotic exoskeleton technology to prepare themselves for a career in exoskeletons and wearable robotics.  For makers and hobbyists who are looking for an interesting and entertaining project in a fascinating field.  For teachers and professors who want to set up exoskeleton courses or labs. The EduExo provides additional teaching material and can save a lot of time and money. Project Background When thinking of robotic exoskeletons, movies such as Iron Man, Aliens or Elysium may come to your mind. But already today there are many real world exoskeletons that support rehabilitation of stroke patients, enable people with paraplegia to walk again or support workers lifting heavy objects and protecting their backs. And todays systems are just the beginning of a very promising and quickly growing field that is in need of many skilled talents within the next years. Due to the novelty of the field, getting involved and learning about robotic exoskeletons is difficult as learning material or even exoskeleton course or classes are not widely available yet. This is made even more difficult as learning about exoskeletons is not possible by theory alone, but also requires practical hands on experience (you have to see and feel it to understand it). Unfortunately, the necessary exoskeleton hardware is expensive and there are no dedicated and affordable learning devices available. This is what we intend to change with the EduExo. The EduExo recently won the Wearable Robotics Association Innovation Competition in April 2017. This prize was awarded to us by a jury of CEOs and CTOs of leading exoskeleton companies, highlighting their demand for exoskeleton talents. Click on the banner below to learn more. " False link

Leading in with “Forget the moon. The next giant leap for mankind could be building a habitat on Mars.” is intellectually lazy. By now, it should be quite clear to all that @nasa is not the human spaceflight savior it’s been touted as. NASA has been weighed down by budgetary gravity for decades, and until SpaceX came along, there were no players in the mix working as aggressively to solve the relatively straight forward problems of aerospace/aeronautical engineering at the pace that private industry is now actively involved in. Just as mainstream media journalists and shortsighted politicians like to overhype subjects they hardly understand, so has the colonization/settlement of the Moon, Mars, and Solar System been polarized as well. Let me make something clear to everyone, from someone involved in the industry on a personal level with many friends and colleagues working on pretty grand aspects of this great journey: the Moon is a priority, and we are embarrassingly far behind as a species as far as ensuring our own survival goes. This kind of polarization has to stop. The mood and conversation surrounding human spaceflight and space exploration in general from within the walls and halls, boardrooms and casual dinners I’ve experienced over the years has not been one or the other in some kind of ultimatum sense. It’s everything, all of it, right now, as soon as we possibly can given budgetary caps and flexibility within the industry regarding new and upcoming tech. And let me tell you: it’s exciting as f*ck, and being discussed very seriously, and maturely from bioethics in the flavor of the Prime Directive, alongside conversations and architecture planning with worst case scenarios in mind. The next 10 - 20 years are going to make a very strong case for the coming of age and maturity for the human species. " True link

So angry. Listen to me. I do not care whether or not you believe vaccines cause autism. Even though studies have shown time and time again that vaccines don’t cause autism and the original study stating that there was a link with autism and vaccines was fraudulent, it does not matter. The reason that people are concerned about vaccines causing autism is because they’re not thinking of the long-term. Here’s the truth: when you are choosing to not having your child vaccinated because you’re afraid of autism, you are actively choosing death over a neurodevelopmental disorder. Let me phrase that in another way – you are either picking autism or death. It doesn’t have to be the death of your child. It can be literally any child. And death is the worst case scenario. Autism is not the worst case scenario. Death is always and will constantly be the worst case scenario. There are children who are too young to get vaccines. There are kids who have compromised immune systems that cannot get vaccines. Your child getting vaccinated prevents these illnesses from spreading and keeps those children safe. It’s called community immunity and it’s important to maintain that so people don’t die. tl;dr - Stop being a selfish asshole and get your kids vaccinated. There are worse things in the world than autism. And before anyone starts coming to my inbox screaming about how “I don’t know how bad autism can be”, I know. Not only do I have a neurodevelopmental disorder, but I also had a friend with a severely autistic brother that could not talk when he was fifteen. I know. And even after witnessing him and being through my own shit, I would still get my kids vaccinated because I want them, and other kids, to live.  WTF, people. Why the fuck do you think that your fear of autism (ungrounded, btw), beats someone else’s RIGHT TO LIVE?!?! You don’t want to vaccinate your kid. Goody gumdrops.

Excerpt:  The Environmental Protection Agency has dismissed at least five members of a major scientific review board, the latest signal of what critics call a campaign by the Trump administration to shrink the agency’s regulatory reach by reducing the role of academic research. A spokesman for the E.P.A. administrator, Scott Pruitt, said he would consider replacing the academic scientists with representatives from industries whose pollution the agency is supposed to regulate, as part of the wide net it plans to cast. “The administrator believes we should have people on this board who understand the impact of regulations on the regulated community,” said the spokesman, J. P. Freire. The dismissals on Friday came about six weeks after the House passed a bill aimed at changing the composition of another E.P.A. scientific review board to include more representation from the corporate world. Some who opposed the dismissals denounced them as part of a broader push by the E.P.A. to downgrade science and elevate business interests. “This is completely part of a multifaceted effort to get science out of the way of a deregulation agenda,” said Ken Kimmell, the president of the Union of Concerned Scientists. “What seems to be premature removals of members of this Board of Science Counselors when the board has come out in favor of the E.P.A. strengthening its climate science, plus the severe cuts to research and development — you have to see all these things as interconnected.” The scientists dismissed from the 18-member Board of Scientific Counselors received emails from an agency official informing them that their three-year terms had expired and would not be renewed. That was contrary, the scientists said, to what they had been told by officials at the agency in January, just before Mr. Trump’s inauguration.   It’s just the beginning. He’s preparing 150 federal court nominations and has 1,352 days to do plenty more damage." False link
