Have you felt pressured in the selection of your first single, because your (former) colleagues Zayn Malik, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson have already released quite successful solo stuff before you? Harry Styles: Yes, you can feel a certain pressure when you release something personal. You feel somehow vulnerable. But I’m happy with the result and it could not have been better. 1LIVE: In the UK, you even kicked Ed Sheeran from # 1 on the charts. Did he complain to you? Harry Styles: No, he wrote me a mega-friendly email. Great guy! So, to have songs in the charts competing against him - that is really an honor. 1LIVE: Were there any friendly emails among the One Direction guys? Harry Styles: Yeah, the guys wrote to me that they heard the song and found it really good. We are regularly in touch. And it’s great to see how successful we are solo and how much fun it is. 1LIVE: So no “ One Direction” -Reunion 2018? Harry Styles: I don’t think any of us are against working together again in the future but at the moment we just enjoy doing our own projects. 1LIVE: With your solo album “ Harry Styles ” you want to show the world your true self - thoughtful, emotional, vulnerable - do you think that a song on the album will surprise the fans especially? Harry Styles: Yes, “ Woman ” will probably surprise my fans the most, even from the sound, the drums and stuff. We experimented a quite a lot in the studio and  ""Woman"" came out - one of our favorite songs on the album. 1LIVE: From 19 September to 8 December, you will be on the world tour with the album in the USA, Europe, Singapore, Australia and Japan. What is the worst thing on tour? Harry Styles: If you miss the alarm clock! That is the worst! The door opens and you only hear: You have two more minutes! 1LIVE: Before you enter the sector on October 27, we’ll see you from the end of June in the cinema: You play in the war film “ Dunkirk ” with Tom Hardy . Did you actually know that actor Channing Tatum and some other celebrities recently gave you stripper nicknames? Just in case you ever want to apply for a guest role in a “ Magic Mike ” session.

However, Polydor has two new Presidents in Tom March and Ben Mortimer, and, after spending the last few years running behind Virgin EMI in the marketshare stakes, has something to prove.The deal is being negotiated, the report continues, by Styles’ new manager Jeffrey Azoff, who left CAA in March to launch his own Full Stop Management alongside Tommy Bruce.Styles will be able to make a fresh start as a solo artist at UMG after five years signed to Sony—where his former bandmate ZAYN is a priority act, the story continues, adding that SYCO boss Simon Cowell is said to be very keen for Styles to stay, with Sony offering lots of incentives.Cowell is bracing himself for Styles’ departure, but he may not be going far: Columbia chief Rob Stringer is another leading candidate for his services, as we’ve reported."

The OneRepublic frontman joined Nick Grimshaw to premiere his band’s new single Wherever I Go on the Radio 1 Breakfast Show and chat about his recent collaborations. He revealed he has a “revolving door” policy in hotel rooms, with huge stars visiting to record future hits. Harry and Ed are two stars he worked with on a recent London visit. “Last time I was in London I had this thing set up at the Corinthia Hotel, it was amazing,” Ryan told Nick Grimshaw. “I had Ed Sheeran in there, we were writing for him, Harry Styles came through. It was this revolving door and everyone I had in there, I thought, ‘I prefer this to working in a studio.’ “For the same amount of money that you’re going to spend on a studio - and they’re expensive - if you take the same currency and find a totally crazy hotel room with a great view of London, you’re going to get more inspiration.” Ryan has penned smash hits for the likes of Ellie Goulding, Beyonce, Maroon 5 and Ariana Grande but claims he has a special friendship with Ed Sheeran - who he is yet to release music with. “He got my number from another producer, like two years ago, we started trading texts and next thing you know - we’re playing with him at Wembley,” says Ryan. “With Taylor Swift it was the same way, the artists come in and out of your life and some of them you become friends with, even when you’re not working.” Ryan also revealed how he tests his own new music on his collaborators, as he believe the best artists struggle to hide their true feelings. “When we were finishing the Adele album, she played me a bunch of the album and I played her a couple of of our songs and it was the same with Ed,” he says. “I’d get the temperature from another artist and they can’t lie, really good artists cannot lie, you can read it all over their faces when they’re not into something.

And when that other famous British Harry (the Princely one) notably asked Styles when he’d last gotten a haircut when the two met in November, Styles’s response was, “I’m not planning on it right now.”But plans change. And Styles’s decision to lop off his locks has sent the passionate Twitter public into a downward spiral of digital tears and follicular mourning.But Harry didn’t just cut off his hair because he needed a new look for summer.

One reason why Styles still cannot land the right role could be his lack of formal training in acting . Moreover, the singer has reportedly refused to take acting classes because he believes he has ample camera experience to help him land a major film role.     “Harry wants to break into Hollywood, but it’s proving to be a struggle,” a friend told Heat magazine, according to Independent.ie “He gets offered silly bit parts and cameos, but that’s not what he’s interested in.”    “He’s not had acting classes, but he’s been around for ages and has done media training and music videos for years.

It is not believed to be a leading role, though all plot and cast details are being kept closely guarded as is often the way with a Nolan project.What we do know is the movie will deal with the World War II evacuation of Dunkirk, which took place from May-June 1940. Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh and Tom Hardy will be part of an ensemble made up largely of unknowns. Pic will be shot on Imax 65mm and 65mm large-format film. Dubbed Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of Dunkirk was a British military operation that saved some 330,000 Allied soldiers trapped in the harbor and surrounded by the German army. Winston Churchill described it as “a miracle of deliverance.”Dunkirk has long been attractive for filmmakers. Joe Wright famously used it for his long tracking shot of James McAvoy on the beach in Atonement. John Mills starred in a classic Ealing stiff upper lipped version in 1958, also called Dunkirk.Styles, as famous for his rock star lifestyle and equally high-profile attachments as his mellifluous voice, has been eyed for film roles before. Harvey Weinstein has previously revealed he offered the singer a role in Justin Chadwick’s Tulip Fever only to be turned down by the skinny-jeanned singer. The band is currently on a hiatus while the individual members focus on their solo projects. Styles has been rumored to have an acting role lined up in season 2 of Scream Queens, but Dunkirk, if a deal makes, would be his first feature role.Styles’ potential involvement comes after an extensive casting process conducted by Nolan, his co-producer and partner Emma Thomas and Warner Bros. He is believed to have impressed the filmmakers with his readings for the part. Rat Pac-Dune Entertainment is co-financing.Warner Bros has dated the film for July 21, 2017.  The studio declined to comment when contacted by Deadline. Styles is repped by CAA." True link

Enter the silk bomber jackets that, while originally crafted as a way for American soldiers to commemorate their time overseas, are becoming increasingly more prevalent on runways. As a result, they’re also showing up a ton on the backs of some of the most influential men in style today. Want proof? Just check out the closets of guys like Harry Styles, Drake, Kanye, and Miguel.So what’s the right way to incorporate a piece like this into your look that you know is going to overshadow everything else you’re wearing? After all, this is a jacket that’s not only silk, but often has embroidered wildlife and/or flowers and tons of other cool, if loud, stuff. Step 1: even if looks cool on Kanye, we’re going to go ahead and say you shouldn’t wear yours with pants that alsofeature birds (some denim will do just fine).And below your pant hem, the simpler the better still applies. We like the way Drake’s wheat Timberland boots pair up with the light blue and tan in his version of the soon-to-be-everywhere jacket. As for the Nirvana tee under it, well, that’s a clash of musical eras that would best be solved by swapping in a plain white or gray tee. (See: Miguel in the pages of GQ.)But if you want the failsafe guide to pulling off one of these fresh bombers with ease, just follow the lead of Harry Styles. That doesn’t mean you need to have shoulder-length locks (though, hey, if you’d like to go full 1970s rock god, be our guest). It does, however, show you how a black jeans and black tee combo is the smart way to tone down a louder piece of outerwear." False link

It was prompted by a story posted Thursday (1/28) in U.K. tabloid The Sun bearing the headline, “Gone Direction: Harry Styles sacks company that made him a global star,” and subheaded, “1D heart-throb dumps management team—and recruits top U.S. agent.” HITS music-biz insider I.B.

I can reveal the ambitious heartthrob has sacked Modest Management – the company that made him a star as a member of the world famous boyband. He will now be managed by close friend and top US agent Jeffrey Azoff, with the pair even discussing investing in a new Hollywood management company. And there are suggestions in the industry that SIMON COWELL and his record company Syco could be the next victim of Harry’s clear out of anyone with previous links to 1D. Last night a senior music insider revealed: “Harry is done with One Direction. He wants to completely disassociate with the band and that includes any professional connection. “His new team will be about launching him as a solo superstar by around this time next year so the work is starting now.” Harry’s move make it increasingly obvious he has zero chance of reuniting with 1D any time soon. That will be upsetting news for NIALL HORAN, LIAM PAYNE and LOUIS TOMLINSON who are all remaining loyal to Modest. A source said: “The message from Harry to the other boys is pretty clear that he doesn’t see 1D together for a long time if at all.” It’s still a tough call for Modest, the company which has spent the last five years making Harry a multi-millionaire.  But given they also have OLLY MURS, CHERYL FERNANDEZ-VERSINI, FIVE SECONDS OF SUMMER and LITTLE MIX on their books, I know they’ll continue to thrive. The battle over which record company will secure Harry, who The Sun on Sunday revealed was two-timing KENDALL JENNER with fashion stylistPANDORA LENNARD, is now going to kick off in earnest. I’m told Cowell, Syco and Sony have no automatic option to sign him as a solo artist, which means they could have to enter a big money bidding war for his signature.  My source explained: “Harry had a great time working with Modest and Syco. “Of course, Cowell and Sony are very keen to sign Harry – there’s a very close relationship between them through 1D and they know he’s going to be a big star. “But the feeling is that he probably wants a completely fresh start and that could include his record company as well. “Universal and Warner are both likely to make big money bids too and he could end up signing one of the most lucrative record deals in recent history.”  Obviously the pressure is on now for Harry to make some brilliant music. However, sources close to the singer insist he’s in no rush. The source said: “He still plans to take some time off before getting into work. It’s possible his music might not come until next year.” " False link

Having organised the appeal well in  advance of Harry’s actual birthday, a Twitter account and fundraising  page are already operating full steam ahead to generate as much interest  in the campaign as possible in the run-up to the 1st of February. The  choice of charity, The Malala Fund, stems from the comments Harry made  in the Action/1D video where he announced his dream of one day living in  a world “where every child can go to school.” Connecting Harry’s comments to the story of Malala Yousafzai who, a  few years ago, was shot over her desire to go to school and receive an  education, the campaign selected by the fans will fund support for all  girls to receive access to formal schooling.​ To  help generate more funds for the cause, the fans behind the ‘H.E.S For  Malala’ drive have even organised a merchandise collection where all the  proceeds from sales will be donated directly to charity.  The  organisers behind the campaign explained the importance of the charity  in their own words: “For his Action1D video, Harry chose to speak about  education. He explained how he met children whose only dream was to go  to school, and how if that dream couldn’t come true, they could only  look forward to a life of struggle. education is the way out of  poverty.  “So  to celebrate Harry’s birthday in a special way, and to support this  great cause and hopefully transform a few lives, we are raising funds to  support girls’ right to education in a world where over 60 million of  them are out of school. We hope for this to be a sweet birthday gift and  to send a message to the world saying that just like our boys care, we  care too, and we are willing to make a difference.” Once again, One Direction fans prove how the combined power of a fanbase can truly influence the world for the better.   If you’d like to make a donation to Harry’s charity drive, you can follow this link here  to make whatever contribution you can.

Things started off slowly with a printed shirt here and there, but then, he started wearing patterned pants and, most recently, a full floral suit. We originally likened his shirt collection to that of your loud, tacky aunt, but his look actually has more of a basis in classic rockstar style than you may have realized.   Harry’s taste has definitely rubbed off on the other members of One Direction,  yet he manages to stick out from the group on red carpets and during  performances thanks, in large part, to his flamboyant style.  Harry’s recent, unexpected style choices may help him stick out from  other male celebrities in 2015, but all draw direct inspiration from  iconic rockstars of the late ’60s and early ’70s.  Here are a few of the most glaring comparisons.  Floral Shirts Harry pulls a lot of pages from Mick Jagger’s style book, who, like  Harry, was initially fond of a preppy, blazer-heavy style. By 1973, Mick  had starting experimenting with his look a little more, growing out his  hair and wearing bold, feminine-inspired blouses. Sound familiar?? Sparkly shoes In 2015, many men stick with simple, leather dress shoes. Harry,  however, follows in David Bowie’s footsteps—literally, LOL—in making  sure his shoes are as impressive as his outfit. In 1973, at the tail-end  of his Ziggy Stardust era, Bowie wore metallic turquoise boots, which  punched up his otherwise simple brown suit. Since late 2013, Harry has  been fond of Saint Laurent boots, which, especially when they’re  sparkly, add an exciting element to his often monochromatic performance  outfits. Embroidered jackets Today, embroidered jackets may invoke the marching band uniform of your  high school, but Harry’s inspiration seems to stem from someone way more  stylish—Jimi Hendrix. In the 1960s, Hendrix bought a vintage military jacket and turned it into one of his trademark looks. He wasn’t the only one—Eric Clapton, Mick Jagger, and John Lennon all purchased similar jackets  from I Was Lord Kitchener’s Valet in London. While Harry’s jacket is  Saint Laurent and military-inspired rather than, y’know, an actual  military uniform, it adds him to a long legacy of musicians who aren’t  afraid of ornate jackets. Tuxedo ruffles Sure, the Harry Styles-Mick Jagger comparisons have been around for  years, but Mick isn’t the only member of the Rolling Stones who Harry  takes inspiration from. Ruffled tuxedo shirts were in style in the  1970s, though—surprise!—they didn’t often make appearances on stage at  Rolling Stones gigs. In 1971, however, Keith Richards managed to turn a  ruffled tuxedo shirt into a look suitable for a Stones performance by  wearing it unbuttoned and without a jacket. 43 years later, Harry  followed Keith’s lead by wearing a ruffled shirt without actually  wearing a tuxedo. The look initially took us by surprise, but a closer examination reveals something important—rockstar-level confidence is required to pull off a shirt like this. Printed suits Harry’s bold floral Gucci suit  took a lot of people by surprise at the 2015 AMAs, but unsurprisingly,  Mick Jagger wore a similarly ~out there~ suit. Checkered suits became  extremely popular by the mid-70s, but Jagger spearheaded the trend,  wearing it in 1969 on “The Ed Sullivan Show.” While it doesn’t seem like  floral suits are set to take red carpets by storm any time soon, we  wouldn’t be surprised if subtle patterns started popping up here and  there—gray suits are ubiquitous and tired. Dudes are inevitably going to  want to mix it up. Calling Harry’s impact now—keep your eyes out. When Zayn resurfaced at Paris Fashion Week  after leaving the band, we were convinced that he was angling for a  fashion campaign. While he may have been—and still might be, for all we  know—he’ll have some stiff competition from Harry, who is quickly  proving he can pull off most things, including flared pants.  Gucci, you know what to do. Harry has a break coming up, after all—what better way to fill it? " False link
