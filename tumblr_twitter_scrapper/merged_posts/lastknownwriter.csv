A lot of rumours start going around about why, like people are hoping for drama, wondering if Jack was being a ‘diva’ and the company is maybe trying to use this for their advantage and it totally gets blown out of proportions. So George forces Jack to address it in a press conference and Jack can’t help himself from being a little shit, because he has better stuff to do than deal with this and so instead of just replying with the prepared statement, he pulls out a +50 power point slide. Some highlights of the topics Jack’s talks about to the press and members of the Falconers: toxic masculinity, heteronormativity, the perpetuation of gender roles and the ‘pink tax’. Everything is properly referenced and there are print outs distributed for people to fact check if they feel like it. Tater takes notes. “We should stop him!” Says one of the PR people in horror, George grabs him by the elbow in a death grip and gives him a stare that will haunt him for the rest of his life. She says nothing, preferring to listen to Jack passionately talk about the ludicrous difference between pay for female and male athletes. The video of the lecture goes viral. Memes and GIFs are born, Shitty cries, he has never been prouder in his life. The company issued an apology and rebrands their product, Jack does sign with them this time and companies learn not to screw with him.   This was his face during the whole presentation. The media was mystified, they’d never seen such an emotive Jack Zimmermann.  " False text

It’s the old saw about the novelist at a cocktail party having to hear someone say, for the millionth time, “I’d love to write a book someday.” Someone–Stephen King? Pretty sure I saw this in a Stephen King foreword–once said they’d like to say to a brain surgeon, “Boy, I’d love to do brain surgery someday.” We treat “the ability to put words into a sentence” like it’s just the same as “the ability to form a coherent narrative that engenders a variety of emotions within the reader and puts them in a scene and shows them what they didn’t see before”. And that’s like me drawing a stick figure and saying I’m an artist. Writers are constantly devalued because everyone thinks they have a book in them and don’t realize the level of skill and commitment it takes to finish even a short story, much less a whole book.  This goes well beyond fandom, but man, I would’ve hoped fandom would know better.  ***REBLOGS AGGRESSIVELY*** " False text

Conway, counselor to Trump, told NBC’s Chuck Todd on Sunday morning that Spicer was offering “alternative facts” when he told reporters Saturday night during an impromptu briefing that “this was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period.” (Aerial footage and Metro ridership statistics show that attendance was down significantly from President Barack Obama’s inauguration in 2009.) “Alternative facts are not facts,” Todd responded. “They’re falsehoods.” Merriam-Webster also noted on Twitter on Sunday that the word “feminism” was getting a lot of attention in the wake of the Women’s March on Washington on Saturday. “'Feminism’ is our #3 lookup right now. It’s been trending all day,” the company wrote. After someone asked on Twitter why the company is pointing out its No. 3 lookup, and not its No. 1 lookup, Merriam-Webster had a ready comeback: “Our #1 lookup is ‘fascism’, which has been trending consistently for the past few months. We report trends when they’re new.”  When you have to remind the fucking president what a fact is.  I love the Merriam-Webster people. " False link

Full details below! Two weeks ago, my dad and I found and rescued a dog from slaughter in a street on our way home. The men who had the dog bound said that it has been abandoned by its owner. They were going to eat it instead. I convinced them to give me the dog in exchange of a small bag of grocery from the store nearby. So they did and my dad and I came home with the little aspin dog we named Boni. We took him to the vet but all they said was that Boni was so weak and malnourished. We took him home with the very intention of getting him back to normal weight and give him all the love he’s been deprived of. For the first week, his recovery was going on well. He learned to eat without looking up warily to people. He stopped flinching whenever I raise my hand to scratch my face. He stopped whining when I touch him. I couldn’t see his ribs from his skin anymore. He started wagging his tail like a normal dog, instead of just crouching with it between his legs. Everything was fine. I thought he was gonna be okay. I’m a college student; studying take up so much of my time. When the vet said they couldnt accommodate us the day I went for check-up (it was a public one, they had many patients more demanding of attention) I promised to go back for the vaccines when I got free time. By the next week, I set my appointment to Wednesday of October 12. Boni died Monday, October 10. The Saturday before that I noticed he was eating less. Sunday, I woke up with him frothing in the mouth. I was alone at the house but I took him to the vet anyway. The doctor asked me then, if Boni has bitten anyone. I said no, he’s sweet and introverted. The doctor said that I should have him checked for rabies anyway, but they don’t have laboratories on weekends, so could I go back tomorrow morning? We wake up to him jumping up and falling on his side. He was whining and poop is everywhere. My dad called the pound without me knowing. But he did let me make the decision if I would let Boni be taken down or not. I couldn’t be cruel, not after everything that has happened to him. I was holding him through his last exhales. But the universe really do want to screw me over because yesterday I started manifesting signs of rabies. The doctor told me I may have contracted it through Boni’s saliva which I was wiping off when I brought him to the vet on Sunday. Yesterday morning I started vomiting and being extremely dizzy. By afternoon, my jaws were locking and it was hard to eat. By the time I was writing this, I’ve just started having fever. Everything happened so miserably fast that I wasn’t financially ready. The full amount of shots would take Php15,000, but I’m trying my best to have my national healthcard work for a discount. Now everyone who knows me or follows me on twitter are aware that I love helping strays. I have seven cats and a dog: all of them I’ve picked up somewhere, somehow. I’ve been very bitter that I’m the one to be infected when there are thousands of animal abusers out there. But I’m starting to come into terms that life doesn’t work the way it should. And I need to get well to help more of the little ones abandoned. I’ve taken one shot out of five. It was very painful. The doctor said I have category III of rabies. I’ll be taking four more shots, as well as oral meds. I would return any amount that is excess from the treatment. I promise. (These are my forms: one from the ABC then another from the university) Disclaimer: the dog in the header isn’t Boni. All I have for pics are those of him looking very unhealthy. These was meant to be the “before” photos. I didn’t have enough time with him to capture “after.” If you want to see those anyway, my email is npaununez@gmail.com TL;DR - Please read it and see the photo docs. I would feel cheap (well I supposed I am but still) to receive donations if you didn’t know what exactly happened.pls guys pauline needs ur help and i cant think of anyone who deserves it more" False link
