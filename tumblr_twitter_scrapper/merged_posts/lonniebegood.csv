It has since been picked up by several other major media outlets. If the CIA and this reporting is to be believed, the GOP-lead Senate deliberately ignored this information from the CIA to gain power. Someone needs to act BEFORE the Electoral College meets on Dec 19th.      So far Lindsay Graham is the only Republican to speak up in outrage. And the only Democrat to make waves has been Harry Reid (who is retiring). The GOP’s reaction is understandable. Trump’s reaction has been as scary as everything else he has done, but 100% understandable. But the Dems? Pure cowardice, as usual. Obama himself needs to do something about this, because any investigation will end on Jan 20th. And YOU reading this need to make serious waves. Our highest Intelligence agency has claimed this election was stolen. Trump WILL get away with this if we don’t take to the streets, IMMEDIATELY. Call someone. Write something. None of this is politics as normal! People need to be jailed for this. This is the literal definition of influence from a foreign government, and exactly what the Electoral College was made to stop. https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-orders-review-of-russian-hacking-during-presidential-campaign/2016/12/09/31d6b300-be2a-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html?utm_term=.3c20e884a782 https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/10/cia-concludes-russia-interfered-to-help-trump-win-election-report Edit: Now NY Senator Chuck Schumer has spoken out calling for congressional investigation  *sigh* more fake news from lefty tumblr– OH shit it’s real  If the GOP knew about this but kept quiet so that they would be voted back into power, then the lot of them are guilty of treason, from Paul Ryan all the way down.  Trump doesn’t say much, but when confronted, he’s defending Russia…not USA. HRC called him Putin’s puppet - and no one believed her (or the 17 intelligence agencies she quoted). December 19th is the day. The Electoral College has a responsibility to the American people to examine all of this and make a decision that is best for the country. If they vote Trump, then we are stuck with him unless he is impeached at a later time for some other provable crime. Though, then we are stuck with Pence.  Only the EC can reverse this. Only the EC can choose another candidate. We have to make our voices heard. Its going to take 270+ electors to pick someone else. Just the handful that have been vocal this week aren’t going to be able to do it alone. Find your elector and let them know that we want them to annul the Trump election. Some will face penalties from their state for being Faithless Electors, but there are enough Americans out there who would help fund the fines incurred in order to keep Russian influence out of our government.

Remember, this is NOT a campaign that will be made effective through harassment. This information has been compiled so we can plead our cases to these electors. We NEED them to understand what a Trump presidency can and will mean for our country.  WE NOW HAVE ELECTOR INFORMATION FOR ALL 16, NON-BINDING STATES. PLEASE SHARE THE LIST WITH EVERYONE WHO’S INTERESTED IN THE ELECTOR MOVEMENT. PLEASE CONTACT ME IF:  Any of the posted information is inaccurate, or if it is for someone who isn’t an elector. You find information for electors that we have not found. How to go about contacting them CALLING is the most likely method to grab their attention. Emily Ellsworth is someone who’s worked in Congress before and they provided some tips on how to gain attention through calling. We’ve provided phone numbers, addresses, and emails. BE PERSUASIVE. Here are 17 power persuasive techniques.  If you have no idea where to start, general template emails/letters can be found HERE and HERE. Politeness is essential, but do not let that undermine the urgency of the situation.  Here are a few points that you can address upon contacting an elector: A personal account of the situation and how it will impact you. Accounts of other people who are living in fear of what the future may bring. Statistics are always eye-catching; ie. hate crimes are expected to skyrocket following the election. We do not want racism and oppression to represent America.  Even if you are or are not a republican, you can write as if you are one. Show concern expressed by many leading GOP members that Trump’s ideals do NOT represent the party platform. Many of them are parents, question what this would mean for their future to see a country so plagued by hatred. Name the republicans who publicly did not support Trump.  Hillary won the popular vote. She is predicted to have won by more than 1.7 MILLION. How can we honor democracy if our system does not respect the opinion of the majority? The voice of the people has NOT been heard. If necessary, emphasize that Hillary Clinton would be unable to accomplish much with a republican-led Senate and House. Remind them that they can abstain, too. Being anti-Hillary doesn’t necessarily guarantee being pro-Trump.  A few of them did not support Trump in the primary. Use this info. Remind the electors that they are only MORALLY bound to vote within their party. There is nothing legally binding that causes them to vote a certain way. If morals were a genuine concern, voting to promote oppression would be more unforgivable than crossing party lines. If you are from the same state as the elector, try to put into perspective what his presidency would mean for you and marginalized groups in your community. Quotes by Trump you can use: “He was a war hero because he was captured,” Trump said at the 2015 Family Leadership Summit in Ames, Iowa. “I like people who weren’t captured,” the current Republican front-runner told political consultant Frank Luntz, who hosted the event. In reference to Republican John McCain, a POW. Trump calling the electoral college a disaster for democracy. A series of tweets complaining when he thought President Obama lost the popular vote but still won the election:  PENNSYLVANIA IS ONE OF THE STATES THAT MAY JOIN THE NATIONAL POPULAR VOTE INTERSTATE COMPACT. This is an agreement that elevates the importance of the popular vote. This compact has not yet been been passed into law. However, emphasizing this pact to the 20 Pennsylvania electors is still important.  THIS is a petition you can sign in support of the electoral college voting in favor of the popular majority. It needs 3,000,000 signatures. It is a step toward spreading the word, but we can’t sign the petition and just stop there. How to spread the word if you do not wish to directly contact electors MAKE FLYERS, SHARE POSTS. If you are not creatively gifted (like myself), HERE is a link to page with the following flyers. If you have any other flyer design, feel free to submit them, and I will add them to the post. Other ways to support the cause  #NotMyPresident T-ShirtsIf interested, order closes on November 23rd. Prices are $20, and orders will be shipped directly to your address. All proceeds go directly to Planned Parenthood. Buy one. Convince your friends and family to buy one. Wear them to protests. If anyone can gift a shirt, let me know. Link HERE.   I know that $20 is a lot for people to afford. Therefore, if I can find a website that will also donate proceeds directly to a charity/cause I will try to make #NotMyPresident WRISTBANDS and HATS, too. Let me know if you are interested. Organize protests, or spread the word of ones you know are taking place. I will be making another document, constantly updated, that will list the #NotMyPresident protests taking place. If you know of any, send me the TIME, the DATE, and the LOCATION. If you go to college, use it as a platform to spread the word. Democratic voting is highest in the most populated areas and among educated voters. If you have connections to people on social media with a lot of followers, try to spread the message to them, too. Repost on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and any other website you can think of. YOU CAN PARTICIPATE IF YOU’RE NOT FROM AMERICA. Please don’t feel like this movement is limited to Americans. A Trump presidency will affect other countries, too. Spread the word, support the movement, donate to those who are in need, if you can. UNPRECEDENTED DOES NOT MEAN IMPOSSIBLE. THE MOVEMENT HAS SPREAD SO FAR ALREADY. WE CAN MAKE THIS HAPPEN. If anyone is lost/confused, the original post can be found here. " False text

It has spread like wildfire over the past few days so I doubt there is any artist out there who hasn’t seen it. But even if you didn’t, you should read on because I’m about to tell you a handy little thing that can help you to protect your art from such assholes as the anon who submitted this bullcrap, as well as art thieves in general. The magic word is Metadata.  Metadata is like an invisible signature that is embeded into a file. It can contain all kinds of information, like Title, date, keywords for online seach engines, and copyright information. And the best thing is, since this information is “hidden” in the code of your picture, it’s hard to remove it. There is a nice basic tutorial on how to add Metadata, or “additional file information” to your images in photoshop. It’s really, really easy so check it out!  “Adding Your Contact And Copyright Info To Your Photos With Photoshop” on PhotoshopEssentials.com  I’m not sure if you can do the same with any other art program. If you know how to do this in other programs / can confirm that it works the same way there, please tell me so I can add the information to this post.  Adding the Metadata will not stop idiots from taking and reposting your art. It also won’t make them stop editing out your signature. It WILL however, help you prove that you are the original artist whenever you have to.Always remember my friends. You, the artist, are protected by law. No one has the right to take your intellectual property and hard work and repost, use or edit it without your permission.

This photograph was taken in the year 1898 in Britain. That is all we know about them. Who were the Black Victorians? Mainstream history has virtually erased them from our minds and history books. We have been filled with images of slavery in America and across the world, but why is it that this chapter in black history was skipped? Why isn’t it equally common knowledge that in the midst of all of that darkness there was light, also. Never before seen photos were uncovered, giving us over 200 images of glances into our past. Many of the photos did not include names or any details whatsoever, cloaking these people in mystery for all of time. At one point in history, people of color were included in high society and walked the cobbled streets of Britain. The women wore intricate, voluminous gowns and wore their hair in curls and chignons. The men in suits and fair business. This may not have been the case for all black people in Britain, but for some it was.  The Victorian Era was ruled under Queen Victoria, an era that is described as an opulent culture, although there were underlying bouts of poverty and child labor. History would like you to believe that black people didn’t arrive in Britain until 1948 during “The Empire Windrush”, when many Jamaican descendants entered the country, but that is not so. There has been proof to suggest otherwise. There is documentation that proves that it wasn’t uncommon to see black faces at a Shakespeare show. We’ve been there all along, humming softly in the background. These images prove that you can’t take mainstream history at face value.

I don’t care if she lies, if she cheats, if she eats bowls of newborn chipmunks for breakfast. She is literally the only thing standing in the way of a fascist dictator becoming President of the United States with a Republican majority congress that guarantees he can do anything he wants and nothing will be able to stop him. I was and still am a Bernie supporter, and I hate a lot of things about Clinton, but none of that matters anymore. If Trump is elected, people are going to die. Women are going to die when Roe v Wade is overturned and Planned Parenthood is defunded. LGBTQ people are going to die when conversion therapy is further legalized and more bathroom bills are passed. POC are going to die as Trump rounds up Mexican immigrants, gives more power to the police, and fuels the fires of Islamaphobia. Poor people are going to die as Obamacare gets overturned and further cuts are made to welfare programs. And that’s just in this country. That’s not even taking account the all-too-likely outcomes of Trump starting new wars in the Middle East and having control of nuclear bombs that he’s said he ‘would not rule out’ using. This is no longer even about ‘the lesser of two evils’. This is not ‘scare tactics’. This is literally life and death. Don’t fuck around and tell me you’re voting third-party or not voting at all, because you don’t have that luxury.   I am delighted that this post has gotten as many notes as it has, but as Election Day grows closer I would like to flush it out with some additional information and facts, particularly for those people who are still considering voting third party and those who still consider Clinton “just as bad” as Trump. Why you shouldn’t vote for Jill Stein Why you shouldn’t vote for Gary Johnson Why you shouldn’t vote third party AT ALL: x, x, x, x (hint, it’s because the electoral college presently makes it impossible for third party to win) Worried about Clinton’s scandals? John Oliver breaks it down. Comparison of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders’ views. They voted the same 93% of the time.  A comprehensive review of Donald Trump’s corruption Donald Trump is being sued for raping a 13 year old girl in 1994, and there is merit to the case. Oxford Economics predicts that Trump’s policies would remove $1 trillion from the US economy, while the Peterson Institute projects that a Trump presidency could cost nearly 5 million US jobs. Donald Trump repeatedly asked why the US couldn’t use nuclear weapons Donald Trump’s cruel streak 37 of the most offensive things Trump ever said   Donald Trump unveils plan to make abortion illegal again     Feds investigating Trump advisor’s meeting with Russian officials seeking to influence U.S. election (Trump called Putin a better leader than Obama.)     Trump’s campaign paid his businesses $8.2 million Trump flies in a plane with gold-plated bathroom fixtures and pays for it with tax dollars   Trump’s financial plan would increase the debt by $5.3 trillion above current levels, Clinton’s by $200 billion  Trump wants to eliminate food safety regulations Trump was sued by the Justice Department for housing discrimination against black people   Trump has reaped at least $885 million in tax breaks, grants and other subsidies for luxury apartments, hotels and office buildings in New York    Trump’s slimy, shameless approach to philanthropy  Concerned that Hillary Clinton defended a child rapist? She tried to get out of it, but she had no choice.  The official Republican platform includes banning abortion, overturning marriage equality, no background checks for purchasing guns, declaring coal “clean energy”, religion used as a guide for legislation, a border wall, and pornography declared a “public menace”. Politifact says that Hillary has made ‘false’ statements 11% of the time and ‘pants on fire’ statements 2%, compared to Trump’s 37% and 17%. Bernie supporter? Bernie says that now is not the time for a protest vote. Bernie tells you why you should vote for Hillary Clinton. Bernie says that Trump must not become president. Please do not waste your vote. You can complain about Hillary Clinton as much as you want, but complain about her while you vote for her. " False text

She said that that wasn’t really a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ question. I said ‘sure it is, you’ve either had sex before him, or you haven’t’.  She brought me onto the couch and sat me down and told me about the boy she liked when she was young and how one night she snuck into his house while his parents were gone and they were kissing and he said they should have sex and she said that she wanted to save sex for marriage and he laughed and basically took all her clothes off and he raped her and as my mom was telling the story she cried and this was the second time I had ever seen my mom cry. She was 12 when it happened.  In grade 8 I got a call from my friend in the middle of the night and she was drunk in the park crying and told me that she went out that night with some other friends and they drank a little and her guy “friend” starting flirting and yes she laughed at first but then he tried to pull her shirt over her head and she pulled away and he ripped her shirt and it was her favourite shirt and then he pushed her to her knees and HIS BEST FRIEND HELD HER JAW OPEN WHILE HE FACE FUCKED HER. And so I went to the park and picked her up and took her home and slept in her bed with her except we didn’t sleep because she just cried and her mouth bled and this was four years ago but I still have to be the one to bring her items to the till it the cashier is a man, and she still has anxiety attacks and she’ll get a rash all over her body and I just want to kill those boys but instead they are still walking around. And I’m in the bathroom with her, dabbing at her skin with a warm cloth until it returns to its regular colour.  And in grade 9 one of my closest friends was kinda seeing this boy and so they hung out one night and then she said that she really had to be getting back home and he said that she wasn’t going anywhere until she gave him what he wanted and he parked the car and took off her clothes and she said no and he ignored her and so she laid in the backseat totally limp and just cried and it wasn’t even sex, he just masterbated by using her body instead of his hand and she came to school the next day with vodka in her water bottle and she drank all day and I had to fight her to get the alcohol away from her and she just cried and threw up and I skipped class while I held her hair back and that same boy texted me a month later, asking if I ever wanted to hangout sometime. And in that same year my very best friend who has never even kissed a boy, confessed to me that when she was 9 years old, her 12 year old cousin made her give him a hand job and he told her that was what cousins do and he gave her a chocolate bar afterwards and she told me that he probably doesn’t even remember it but that it’s something that she’ll never have the luxury of forgetting.  And in grade 10 I knew a girl who invited her best friend over to watch Disney movies and then he started to put his hands down her pants and she said no but she is 130lbs and he is 220lbs and he called her a tease while she tried to fight him but he used one hand to hold her down, and the other to put inside of her and i was the one to push her inside of a classroom and stand in front of her while calling the police when he showed up at our school looking for her and she was so damn scared.  And a few months later I skipped class and was in the car with a guy who i had had unprotected sex with in the past while under the influence of cocaine but this time I was sober and I insisted we use a condom but he told me he couldn’t feel anything while the condom was on so he ripped it off and I said I refused to have unprotected sex again and so he just grabbed me and forced himself into my mouth and I was crying and he pulled me onto him and I just came saying “stop” over and over like a broken record but he must’ve heard something different because he went until he came and I just sat naked in the backseat while he drove me back to the school and said “we should do this again sometime”. And I had five showers that night and I scratched at my skin so hard to try and rip his fingerprints off of me, I still have the scars.  And I found out soon afterwards that that same guy had raped a classmate of mine, 5 months earlier and she told me about how he brought her McDonald’s first, and how he said they could take things slow and she told me about how he didn’t listen to her either. And he goes to our school and so after she told me about her incident and I told her about mine, we decided to report it to the police and the trial is currently still going on and he told people about it, except in his version we are just “asking for attention” and all his friends talk about how bad they feel for him. As if HE is the one that still wakes up screaming. As if HE felt like his skin no longer was beautiful, no longer belonged to him.  And I held her in my arms as she bawled after giving the police her statement. And she did the same for me.  And I met a woman a year ago in a paint store and she had a service dog and I asked what the dog was for and it turns out that she had been so brutally raped and abused in her life, that the dog is literally trained to keep men away from her.  And I’m so FUCKING SICK AND TIRED OF THIS WORLD WE ARE LIVING IN. How many rape victims eyes have I already looked into? How many more will I? And how many more friends will I hold while they shake? Because I don’t know how many more I can take. And who the fuck still has the nerve to make rape jokes? And… Something just has to change. Please, someone just start being that change.  -16 year old girl  Did I reblog this already I dont care " False text

On Aug. 10 Larnell Bruce with his friends was in the parking lot chatting while Courtier and his gf drove up to the nearest convenience store. Almost immediately they started to argue and Courtier began to beat the kid up, while Colleen Hunt allegedly cried “Get him, baby, get him.“ The white man smashed Bruce’s head into the front window of the store when Bruce finally decided to pull out a knife to protect himself.

What if I told you that there’s a woman with a blog who had to feed both herself and her young son…on 10 British pounds ($15/14 Euro) per week? Let me tell you a thing. This woman saved my life last year. Actually saved my life. I had a piggy bank full of change and that’s it. Many people in my fandom might remember that dark time as when I had to hock my writing skills in exchange for donations. I cried a lot then.  This is real talk, people: I marked down exactly what I needed to buy, totaled it, counted out that exact change, and then went to three different stores to buy what I needed so I didn’t have to dump a load of change on just one person. I was already embarrassed, but to feel people staring? Utter shame suffused me. The reasons behind that are another post all together.  AgirlcalledJack.com is run by a British woman who was on benefits for years. Things got desperate. She had to find a way to feed herself and her son using just the basics that could be found at the supermarket. But the recipes she came up with are amazing.  You have to consider the differing costs of things between countries, but if you just have three ingredients in your cupboard, this woman will tell you what to do with it. Check what you already have. Chances are you have the basics of a filling meal already.  Here’s her list of kitchen basics.  Bake your own bread. It’s easier than you think. Here’s a list of many recipes, each using some variation of just plain flour, yeast, some oil, maybe water or lemon juice. And kneading bread is therapeutic.  Make your own pasta–gluten free.  She gets it. She really does. This is the article that started it all. It’s called “Hunger Hurts”. She has vegan recipes. A carrot, a can of kidney beans, and some cumin will get you a really filling soup…or throw in some flour for binding and you’ve got yourself a burger.  Don’t have an oven or the stove isn’t available? She covers that in her Microwave Cooking section.    She has a book, but many recipes can be found on her blog for free. She prices her recipes down to the cent, and every year she participates in a project called “Living Below the Line” where she has to live on 1 BP per day of food for five days.  Things improved for me a little, but her website is my go to. I learned how to bake bread (using my crockpot, but that was my own twist), and I have a little cart full of things that saved me back then, just in case I need them again. She gives you the tools to feed yourself, for very little money, and that’s a fabulous feeling.   Tip: Whenever you have a little extra money, buy a 10 dollar/pound/euro giftcard from your discount grocer. Stash it. That’s your super emergency money. Make sure they don’t charge by the month for lack of use, though.    I don’t care if it sounds like an advertisement–you won’t be buying anything from the site. What I DO care about is your mental, emotional, and physical health–and dammit, food’s right in the center of that.  If you don’t need this now, pass it on to someone who does. Pass it on anyway, because do you REALLY know which of the people in your life is in need? Which follower might be staring at their own piggy bank? Trust me: someone out there needs to see this.   Reblogging for all the impoverished students. Jack is the breadline queen. And if you don’t need this - donate to your nearest food bank, stat.  Reblogging for students, working folks, and everyone who’s ever had to choose between essentials at the store because you can only afford milk OR bread, not both. " False text

You’ll make mistakes and be uncomfortable. (But don’t stuff yourself till you’re sick either.) 2: If you have to go to the bathroom, go. A full bladder or otherwise does serious damage to the attention and patience spans. Plus it gives you time to stretch your legs. 3: Before you ink it, leave it alone. Come back later (a few hours, a day?) and check for major anatomy mistakes. Work on something else while you’re waiting. 4: Stay hydrated! The brain and fine motor skills work better when properly circulated. 5: Do not have an excessive amount of sugar before sitting down to work. You’ll get jittery and impatient. Same goes for immense amounts of caffeine. 6: If you’re stuck, take a break to stand and stretch. Walk around the room. But don’t THINK of it as a break. Just take time to really focus on your body. Loosen it up, get a goooood long stretch and some deep breaths. (but don’t pass out!) It’ll jolt the mind awake and let you really relax a moment. 7: Keep. All. Your. Old. Art. I don’t care what it is. Keep it. Date it if it’s in your computer folders. Make a suitcase filled with it. (I personally have ALL my old art in a thick work folder.) 8: Keep your sketchbooks together, used and unused. If there’s a good sale on sketchbooks, get two or three! You won’t regret it later. There’s no such thing as too many. (I currently have about ten spankin’ new sketchbooks and I know I’ll need/use every single one of them.) 9: Date your sketchbooks. Put a start and finish date on them. 10: I’m afraid I don’t practice this one: date your drawings. You’ll be happy about it later. You don’t need to SIGN every drawing, but do date them. At least date pages. 11: ART BLOCK HAPPENS. Art block is pretty much a CONSTANT state of mind for artists. You’re never out of art block totally. But sometimes you get bursts of inspiration that make it feel like you’re out. So instead of feeling like you’re ill if you suddenly have artblock, remind yourself that this happens all the time, and you get out of it eventually, every time. c:> 12: If you’re REALLY stuck on some bad art block, do what I do. Draw a brain barf. This is where you take a blank sheet of paper, and you just LET your hand be A.D.D. Draw whatever comes to mind, as it comes to mind. in the middle of drawing a hippo in a top hat but you think of a jolly rancher riding a unicycle? Switch immediately. Let your brain just vomit all over the page. You’ll be surprised what comes up and what art block this can get you out of. It’s gotten me out of it various times. 13: Take advice from more experienced artists. But do NOT take everything as Gospel. Some people are just wrong. 14: HAND SHYNESS/ ART ENVY/ SELF CONSCIOUSNESS/ AND SKILL IMPATIENCE WILL EAT YOU ALIVE like a Titan. Do not let yourself get shy after looking at ‘better art’, do not let yourself think your art is worthless or your skills are worthless, and do not let yourself get frustrated that you cannot be at a higher skill level RIGHT NOW. Your brain will try to do this. All the time. Keep yourself in check. If you keep going at it, and keep working, you will get better. This is why you keep your old art. Look at it to remind you how far you’ve come. 15: Draw what you like. This is so important. (This does not apply for exploitative art. :l That’s just wrong. So long as you’re not targeting someone harmfully, I guess you’re fine.) But don’t let people’s preferences dictate what you can and can’t draw. Draw whatever the heck you like. Accept that no matter WHAT there will be someone out there that hates it. Always. This is just a fact of life. But don’t let it get you down. I would have stopped being an artist at day one if I had. 16: You never. Stop. Learning. Ever. You will be old and grey and still be learning new things. That’s okay. That’s the nature of art. Even the ‘pros’ don’t know everything. I hope these help someone out there~ " False text

It’s a great job 99% of the time and a lot of our customers are pretty neat people. Any who, middle of the day this little old lady comes up. She’s lovably kooky. She effuses how much she loves the store and how she wishes she could spend more time in it but her husband is waiting in the car (OH! I BETTER BUY HIM SOME CHOCOLATE!), she piles a bunch of art supplies on the counter and then stops and tells me how my bangs are beautiful and remind her of the ocean (“Wooooosh” she says, making a wave gesture with her hand) Ok. I think to myself. Awesomely happy, weird little old ladies are my favorite kind of customer. They’re thrilled about everything and they’re comfortably bananas. I can have a good time with this one. So we chat and it’s nice.  Then this kid, who’s been up my counter a few times to gather his school textbooks, comes up in line behind her (we’re connected to a major university in the city so we have a lot of harried students pass through). She turns around to him and, out of nowhere, demands that he put his textbooks on the counter. He’s confused but she explains that she’s going to buy his textbooks.  He goes sheetrock white. He refuses and adamantly insists that she can’t do that. It’s like, $400 worth of textbooks. She, this tiny old woman, bodily takes them out of her hands, throws them on the counter and turns to me with a intense stare and tells me to put them on her bill. The kid at this point is practically in tears. He’s confused and shocked and grateful. Then she turns to him and says “you need chocolate.” She starts grabbing handfuls of chocolates and putting them in her pile.  He keeps asking her “why are you doing this?” She responds “Do you like Harry Potter?“ and throws a copy of the new Cursed Child on the pile too.  Finally she’s done and I ring her up for a crazy amount of money. She pays and asks me to please give the kid a few bags for his stuff. While I’m bagging up her merchandise the kid hugs her. We’re both telling her how amazing she is and what an awesome thing she’s done. She turns to both of us and says probably one of the most profound, unscripted things I’ve ever had someone say: “It’s important to be kind. You can’t know all the times that you’ve hurt people in tiny, significant ways. It’s easy to be cruel without meaning to be. There’s nothing you can do about that. But you can choose to be kind. Be kind.” The kid thanks her again and leaves. I tell her again how awesome she is. She’s staring out the door after him and says to me: “My son is a homeless meth addict. I don’t know what I did. I see that boy and I see the man my son could have been if someone had chosen to be kind to him at just the right time.” I’ve bagged up all her stuff and at this point am super awkward and feel like I should say something but I don’t know what. Then she turns to me and says: I wish I could have bangs like that but my darn hair is just too curly.“ And leaves.  And that is the story of the best customer I’ve ever had. Be kind to somebody today.  " False text

While  Donald Trump is a bumbling political idiot, Mike Pence is actively  against the people and possibilities that we need to help America to  have a strong future. His career has been built on hateful exclusion,  not intelligent inclusion. Here are some things that every voter should know about Mike Pence: - Science and invention helped build America, but Mike Pence is 100% anti-science.  He chooses not to accept the preponderance of evidence that supports  anthropomorphic climate change, and he thinks schools should be required  to teach Christian “creationism” mythology alongside evolution in  science classrooms. - Mike Pence is anti-environment.  As governor, he has vetoed every piece of environmental regulation that  has crossed his desk. He doesn’t want the EPA to regulate greenhouse  gases, and he does want to open up pretty much every part of our country  to oil and coal companies. No more wildlands under Pence. He is one of  those irresponsible extremists who think that God gave us the world so  we could just use it up, and when it is all used up the second coming  will occur. There is no Biblical basis for this belief. - Females make up more than half of the American population, but Mike Pence is anti-woman.  He has said the Disney movie “Mulan,” which was based on a centuries  old Chinese poem, was the work of a “mischievous liberal” trying to  groom young children to accept women in combat. “Despite her delicate  features and voice, Disney expects us to believe that Mulan’s ingenuity  and courage were enough to carry her to military success on an equal  basis,” he wrote on his radio show’s website. - He obsessively pursues a personal vendetta to take Title X funding  away from Planned Parenthood because Planned Parenthood provides  abortion services. Title X money CANNOT be used for abortions. Abortions  are paid for by the recipient or through private, tagged donations.  Taking away Title X will not impact abortion services, but it would  leave thousands of women without access to cancer screenings or birth  control.  - Speaking of birth control, Mike Pence once again revealed his historical ignorance in saying that condoms are “modern” and “liberal.”   He thinks all women should be pregnant unless they can’t afford a baby,  in which case they should abstain from sex, even if they are married.  That’s right: sex is only for procreation in PenceWorld. If you can’t  afford the diapers, then hubby should be sleeping on the couch. - Mike Pence is also anti-gay,  to the point of denial. He doesn’t want the government to pay for  cancer screenings, but he does want the government to pay for abusive  “conversion therapy” programs that systematically undermine the victim’s  self-esteem, and then indoctrinate them into robotic gender-appropriate  behaviors. He has signed into law a bill that allows discrimination  against LGTBQ customers based on religious belief. - As governor of Indiana, Mike Pence was personally responsible for an outbreak of AIDS when he refused to allow clean needle exchanges for drug addicts. Instead, he asked people to pray for the addicts. - Mike Pence is racist.  He thinks there is “too much talk” about institutional racism in law  enforcement because “police officers are human beings.” His solution is  unity through “faith.” The Indiana governor has tried to prevent Syrian  refugees from settling in his state because the “pose a threat to safety  of residents.” Pence argued that his policy was based on fear, not  race, so it wasn’t discriminatory. A Federal Appeals Court dismissed his  racist arguments on October 3, 2016. - A Federal Court also had to block his bizarre anti-abortion law  that required burial or cremation for fetuses, whether miscarried or  aborted, no matter how far along the pregnancy had progressed.  - Mike Pence is pro-birth, but not pro-life.  He once funneled $3.5M dollars from Temporary Assistance to Needy  Families into programs that counsel against abortion. He wants those  women to have those babies, but he doesn’t care if the kids starve or  live on the streets afterward. - Mike Pence has refused to comply with federal guidelines aimed at reducing prison rape. When  you add it all together, you can see that the most dangerous part of  the Trump-Pence ticket is …that calculating quiet man who will be leading the charge from behind. Mike Pence is basically against anyone who is not white, conservative, Christian, and male. When  Mike Pence was a young lawyer on the rise, he challenged a longtime  Democratic congressman for a seat in a Republican-leaning Indiana  district. He seemed to have it in the bag until voters were stunned to  learn that he had been using political donations to pay personal  expenses including the mortgage on his house, his credit card bill,  groceries, golf tournament fees, and car payments for his wife.” http://www.smobserved.com/story/2016/10/10/opinion/mike-christian-sharia-pence-is-scarier-than-donald-trump/2081.html " False link

Super-Short Version: A lot of the states that are voting in the Primaries on Tuesday lean heavily towards Hillary, so there’s a good chance Bernie’s gonna look like he’s taking a huge hit this week. In the weeks afterwards, however, the states that have been leaning towards Bernie will have their Primaries, so he’ll make a comeback then… Assuming, of course, that we don’t all get discouraged from the Super Tuesday results and remember to vote. Apparently, the same thing happened back in ‘08, with Hillary gaining huge leads on Super Tuesday but Obama making a comeback afterwards to get the nomination. In any case, keep yer hopes up, no matter what happens on Tuesday! Oh, and once again… Make sure you go out and vote! " False link

I wasn’t vaccinated. I was brought up on an incredibly healthy diet: no sugar till I was 1, breastfed for over a year, organic homegrown vegetables, raw milk, no MSG, no additives, no aspartame. My mother used homeopathy, aromatherapy, osteopathy; we took daily supplements of vitamin C, echinacea, cod liver oil.I had an outdoor lifestyle; I grew up next to a farm in England’s Lake District, walked everywhere, did sports and danced twice a week, drank plenty of water. I wasn’t even allowed pop; even my fresh juice was watered down to protect my teeth, and I would’ve killed for white, shop-bought bread in my lunchbox once in a while and biscuits instead of fruit, like all the other kids.We ate (organic local) meat maybe once or twice a week, and my mother and father cooked everything from scratch—I have yet to taste a Findus crispy pancake, and oven chips (“fries,” to Americans) were reserved for those nights when Mum and Dad had friends over and we got a “treat.”As healthy as my lifestyle seemed, I contracted measles, mumps, rubella, a type of viral meningitis, scarlatina, whooping cough, yearly tonsillitis, and chickenpox. In my 20s I got precancerous HPV and spent six months of my life wondering how I was going to tell my two children under the age of 7 that Mummy might have cancer before it was safely removed.So the anti-vaccine advocates’ fears of having the “natural immunity sterilized out of us” just doesn’t cut it for me. How could I, with my idyllic childhood and my amazing health food, get so freaking ill all the time?…My two vaccinated children, on the other hand, have rarely been ill, have had antibiotics maybe twice in their lives, if that. Not like their mum. I got many illnesses requiring treatment with antibiotics. I developed penicillin-resistant quinsy at age 21—you know, that old-fashioned disease that supposedly killed Queen Elizabeth I and that was almost wiped out through use of antibiotics.* “If you think your child’s immune system is strong enough to fight off vaccine-preventable diseases, then it’s strong enough to fight off the tiny amounts of dead or weakened pathogens present in any of the vaccines.” " False link

It is aware of its own pettiness. Like a screaming toddler denied a sweet, it becomes more righteous the more it reminds itself that after all, it’s only a story. Only a story. Only the things we tell to keep out the darkness. Only the myths and fables that save us from despair, to establish power and destroy it, to teach each other how to be good, to describe the limits of desire, to keep us breathing and fighting and yearning and striving when it’d be so much easier to give in. Only the constitutive ingredients of every human society since the Stone age. Only a story. Only the most important thing in the whole world. The people who are upset that the faces of fiction are changing are right to worry. It’s a fundamental challenge to a worldview that’s been too comfortable for too long. The part of our cultural imagination that places white Western men at the centre of every story is the same part that legitimises racism and sexism. The part of our collective mythos that encourages every girl and brown boy to identify and empathise with white male heroes is the same part that reacts with rage when white boys are asked to imagine themselves in anyone else’s shoes. Read more   “…because when you’ve been used to privilege, equality feels like prejudice.” and also “Capitalism is just a story. Religion is just a story. Patriarchy and white supremacy are just stories. They are the great organising myths that define our societies and determine our futures, and I believe - I hope - that a great rewriting is slowly, surely underway.”  ^^^^ YES. This whole thing is glorious. " False link

African folklore is just as rich, and just as perverse as that shit. We  have witches, we have demons, we have goblins, and mad kings. We have  stories of royal succession that would put Wolf Hall to shame. We beat the Tudors two times over.“But be warned, James is not using the word geek lightly;  this thing is going to be seriously nerdy. “One hundred pages describing  a village? Hell yeah,” he promises. “A big appendix on magic  techniques? Of course I’m gonna do it. Two hundred pages on a mysterious  dwarf race that lives underground? Fuck yes.” Get your d20 ready — this  world is going to inspire one hell of a role-playing game someday." False link
