But I think a lot of people are sort of seduced by the comfort of giving up, and with the good intention of creating communities of understanding and non-judgement between mentally ill people, social media has unwittingly created communities of mentally ill people encouraging each other to give up. ¬†To just accept that this is the way their lives are, and there‚Äôs no possibility of getting better. ¬†And that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs gotten to the point of people dismissing actual mental health professionals as being no different than some ignorant person who doesn‚Äôt know the first thing about psychology and thinks an avocado smoothie will solve all your problems. Avocado smoothie people are coming from the first perspective, that being depressed is a free choice that you can easily opt out of. ¬†Therapists are coming from the second perspective, where mental illness is a horrible reality, but given that you‚Äôre seeing them, a provider of mental health treatment, of fucking course they‚Äôre going to give you advice on how to treat your mental illness! ¬†Your therapist isn‚Äôt going to sit around and say¬†‚Äúyeah man that sucks, haha look at this funny meme about how much you want to kill yourself.‚Äù ¬†Your therapist is going to give you recommendations of activities and habits that will help you recover. ¬†And they understand that these activities are not easy!!! ¬†They get that!!! ¬†The reason they‚Äôre there is to help you introduce these activities and ways of thinking into your life!!! ¬†Otherwise they‚Äôd just hand you a pamphlet and walk out!!! But you can‚Äôt access that kind of help - the kind where you say¬†‚Äúgetting out of the house is a real problem for me, I never have the energy to get out of bed‚Äù and your therapist says¬†‚Äúokay let‚Äôs figure out how to break this down into small steps, we‚Äôll set a small goal for this week, and next time we meet you can tell me if it worked out, and if it did then we can figure out what the next goal will be, and if not then we can figure out why it didn‚Äôt work and try a different approach‚Äù - if you immediately dismiss any mention of recovery as¬†‚Äúneurotypical bullshit.‚Äù Anyways please please please take your healthcare seriously, get treatment, and realize that giving up and normalizing your depression/anxiety/etc as something that will never ever get better (yes, even if it‚Äôs a chronic condition that you‚Äôll never fully cure, you still need to treat it) is not okay. ¬†Try to get good nutrition. Try to get sunshine and exercise. ¬†Try to be social. ¬†Making an effort to do things that will help you is not the same as thinking mental illness is a switch you can easily flip. ¬†Getting treatment is not the same thing as pretending your mental illness doesn‚Äôt exist or isn‚Äôt serious. ¬†On the contrary, getting treatment is taking your mental illness seriously. ¬†I‚Äôm not saying you should never make a joke or reblog a fucking meme or anything, I‚Äôm saying don‚Äôt use social media as your mental health care provider. ¬†Social media can be a way to vent, but venting is not the same thing as recovering. Honestly it can take a very long time to get to that¬†‚Äústep 3‚Ä≥ perspective but it‚Äôs a vital step.  THIS.  I‚Äôve got my boyfriend calling me at 8am every weekday morning to get me out of bed so that I *get out of bed*. I then tell him when I‚Äôve gotten to the gym.  We have worked this out between us, consensually, because I can‚Äôt fucking make myself do it. Because depression. But when I get up and go to the gym, suddenly my days get way, way more functional. I eat real food, I run errands, I cook- instead of laying on the couch feeling like my diaphragm got nailed to the floor. (They don‚Äôt all necessarily happen every day, but they become at least theoretically feasible.) This isn‚Äôt part 1, it‚Äôs part 3. Because dammit, I am fucking sick of this shit. I don‚Äôt deserve it and it‚Äôs a real issue- and for me, having someone to basically hotwire me because my starter is broken is how we‚Äôre gonna get a routine that takes minimal spoons to run.   Sometimes depression is cureable. Sometimes it‚Äôs just treatable. But dissing treatment because ‚Äúgah neurotypicals‚Äù is shooting yourself in the foot.  Sometimes self-care is baths and Netflix and junk food and Tumblr. And sometimes self-care is an arranged phone call at 8am.  this is so fucking important, i hate the culture on this site that dissmisses all treatment as ‚Äòadvocado aunts‚Äô telling you to stop lying in bed all day and just be happy. recovery is a choice, a hard one, but a choice nontheless.  Also some therapists are themselves mentally ill and are speaking from very personal experience. This happens a lot more than anyone seems aware of. There are many reasons people get into the field, but sometimes that‚Äôs one of them.¬†  Its cool that tumblr makes us all feel less alone, but I was severely depressed for three years and honestly spending less time on tumblr and more time actually following all the annoying ‚Äúneurotypical‚Äù advice, like reaching out to family and friends, creating a routine, focusing on improving my diet and habits and exersizing daily (and yes, doing yoga) is what has helped be get out of it.¬† ¬†It takes a herculean effort especially to start. But i swear to god, its worth it. Please dont let this site be something that contributes to your suffering when you could have so much more. " False text
