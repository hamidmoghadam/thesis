It’s not an appropriate tool for many situations, and can only really be wielded effectively for a handful of specific purposes. It can’t be used to construct or engrave, but it can be wedged into gaps and it can break and dislodge. Similarly, we have to view voting in elections within staggeringly unequal capitalist societies in the same way - a means to an end, a tool for achieving specific results, rather than a cure-all for society’s ills. Voting once every few years for a representative selected by unaccountable party bureaucrats according to the interests of wealthy donors cannot be a method of ensuring the amplified permanence of working-class interests, but it can be used to express a rebuke, to tip fine balances in those areas where corrupt voting systems equalise themselves, and to open up political spaces for other forms of political organisation. Abstaining from voting on principle is as foolish as credulous faith in neoliberalised ‘democratic’ institutions. Nobody outside of the smoky gentlemen’s clubs frequented by Tory backbenchers even wanted this election, that much is obvious. But there’s a real opportunity for young, angry working-class people to wield the crowbar: to use their vote in pursuit of a new kind of politics. It’s not that Jeremy Corbyn would make a great PM - he’s a deeply flawed leader, despite his obvious personal sincerity. It’s not that Labour’s manifesto is a radical socialist document which will be cast in iron for the ages - it sits well to the Right of any of their official positions in the 1970s. It’s not even that Labour will be able to fulfil its promises - Labour’s Blairite backbenchers, some of whom even dub themselves ‘the Resistance’, will enact every obstacle possible to obstruct even Corbyn’s modest social-democratic reforms. It’s that a Corbyn victory would demonstrate the huge popularity of socialist ideas. It would usher in a government much more susceptible to pressure from organisations of the working-class, creating a space within which we can organise communities to push for real concrete improvements in people’s lives. And it would draw a clear line in the sand between those who are in favour of pro-working-class politics, and those who’ll devote their energies to propping up the interests of the elite - both inside and outside the Labour Party.

Like I can kinda understand with the UK given the Tory party’s historical association with landowners, but that won’t be the case everywhere while rural far right voting tends to be a common trend. Marx put it succinctly: “The idiocy of rural life”. Although that’s somewhat of a sharp phrase to our modern ears (and Marx was arguably quick to dismiss the struggles of rural workers as against those of the urbanised proletariat), he had a kernel of a point. Agricultural working-class communities are often highly fragmented in terms of their class makeup, with distinctions between landowners and tenants blurred by feudalistic bonds of patronage and familial ties, and even modern agricultural communities are often diverse in their political formations, with some families and groups maintaining political hegemony over organs like parish councils and communities boards.As well, it’s important to realise that rural communities are often highly monocultural. Taken alongside the well-documented tendency for anti-migrant sentiments and racism to proliferate in areas where there is little immigration or mixing of ethnicities, and the failure of workers organisations to effectively overcome obstacles to rural organising, it’s possible to see how rural working-class communities have become somewhat of a natural constituency for far-right groups.That said, where pro-working-class organisations have effectively combated the challenges to organising rural workers, or where pre-existing democratic traditions have been harnessed to generate new forms of solidarity, particularly in the Global South, they have often become heartlands of revolutionary movements, cf. Cuba, the FARC in Colombia, the Indian Naxalites, Native American advocacy groups in the USA, etc etc.Source: I grew up in Tory-voting Buttfuck, Nowhere." False text

[from Redditor beernsleep] FM: No society can function without a degree of coercion - only some of which is violent. Socialism seeks to minimise the degree of coercion (and violence) by democratising human organisations which produce value (ie. the ‘means of production’), and by devolving legislative power to the widest possible base in society (ie. the full participation in citizens in the creation of laws which shape their lives).  This means that the state is still a class structure - in that it represents the collective interests of a particular class - but that its nature as a coercive guardian of the interests of capital and profit has been replaced by its role as a co-ordinator for democratically agreed economic plans, and as a facilitator for the widest degree of democratic involvement. At the same time, I would expect the formal means of disciplining the working-class, ie. the police, the court system and the prisons, to be disbanded wholesale: to be replaced with locally accountable public safety committees, deliberative justice panels and socially-orientated rehabilitation programmes. As such, socialism will seek that future socialist states will have the closest possible relationship with the class whose interests they promote: no longer will a separate caste of unelected bureaucrats have insular, antagonistic relationship with ‘the economy’; rather, I think we’d see workers and trade unionists be elected to oversight boards at all levels and the regular rotation of staff (have a read about Che Guevara’s time as Cuba’s minister for economics to see how he ran his staff, eg. a system of ‘demotions’ where state workers switched places with those several levels below them, non-material rewards for high performance etc). This does not mean that socialism is entirely non-coercive. Majority decision making (and even consensus decision making) is inherently coercive to some degree, since there will always be people in that minority, and who have to abide by decisions which they object to. And if those people are damaging and disruptive, I’m sure that there will be time where the coercive elements of society will sadly have to be used - democratised and fully accountable as they may be. But socialism seeks to consciously undermine the necessity even for democratic planning or statehood by opening the possibility to lay the foundations of a communistic utopia. Contrast this with the joyful and deliberate concentration of social power in the hands of a tiny elite which inevitably follows any free-market system, and you’ll see my point.

Like would a worker coop meeting with the community to decide production be considered socialism by Marxist? Or would it have to be a planned economy? [via Redditor dovah_kun] FM: Workers controlling the means of production pretty much is the definition of socialism as far as Marxists are concerned - but when we unpack that phrase it leads to a whole set of further political conclusions.Who are the workers in question? Do we mean just white, male, blue collar workers in industrial professions? I’d argue that representing the whole of the working-class entails the deliberate and conscious enfranchisement of women, LGBT people, PoC, people with disabilities and other ‘minorities’ (who in fact make up the vast majority of the working-class) with a revolutionary politics.What does control entail? Does it just mean nominal ownership within a centrally planned state bureaucracy? Again, I’d argue that democratic participation in the process of production at all levels is vitally and inescapably important - and I think that necessarily leads one to conclude that a significant degree of participative economic planning would be both inevitable and highly desirable for fulfilling human needs. But I don’t see any contradiction between direct community control of workplaces and higher-tier democratic forums for wider social planning - within a decentralised democratic polity (rather than states with rigorously defined and policed borders) it’s absolutely possible that we could have both a high degree of communitarian control of small and medium workplaces, with more comprehensive structures of planning for more complex large industrial combines in areas like transport, finance, energy and food.And, to get super meta, what do we define as the means of production? Would we just want those large industries to be democratised, with smaller enterprises left to be run by capitalistic methods? I’d argue that that would be a contradictory halfway house which would inevitably lead to the worst kinds of social strife and counterrevolution if it were adopted as anything but the most immediate transitional measure. The core function of capital is to concentrate wealth in the hands of the few, and should be frankly stamped out as a means of allocating resources, to be replaced by communitarian self management and democratic planning in all areas of economic life. As well, I think we’d also see the democratisation of hitherto private spaces: art, journalism, culture, literature, education, public safety, etc etc.So - here we can see that a simple maxim about 'workers controlling the means of production’ does in fact contain within it a comprehensive toolkit for a new kind of society. I hope that’s some food for thought.Ask | Podcast | Support" True text

A key definition of fascism which is often left out from liberal categories is the presence of a highly organised (if not paramilitarised) mass movement made up of an unholy alliance between the petit-bourgeois and the poorest elements of the working-class. This mass movement serves to allow fascist parties within bourgeois state institutions to wield a much greater degree of independence from the ruling class than they would otherwise be capable of, what Marxists call ‘Bonapartism’. Whilst this was absolutely present in fascist Germany and Italy (and to a lesser degree in Spain), Trump has no such organised support base - and is therefore much more a prisoner to the vested interests in the financial and industrial elite who seek to use him as a pawn.  Whilst Trump’s ideas are undoubtedly fascistic, and the vocalisation of this ideology within state institutions legitimises and emboldens neo-Nazis and white nationalists, hugely increasing the dangers which they pose to PoC, women and the organised labour movement, I think it’s a misreading of the class character of Trumpism to define it as explicitly fascist. This presents us with a very different set of immediate organisational priorities: organising oppositional groups to fight for working-class political interests across and between the divisions which Trumpism seeks to widen and concretise, rather than uncompromising people’s war - at this stage."

Meetings between high-level representatives of rival capitalist nations often reinforce détente and facilitate co-operation. The very worst excesses of Cold War posturing were curbed by direct diplomatic interactions between state actors; it’s highly possible, for example, that a nuclear exchange would have taken place in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis if the personal intervention of Bobby Kennedy had not made the US’s aggressive policy more comprehensible and predictable to Kremlin bureaucrats. There are many things that Trump should be brutally criticised for - not least for seconding his unelected, unaccountable daughter to sit in for him at other high-level meetings during the week - but holding cursory meetings with rival state leaders is not one of them.  We have to assume that, had Hillary won in November, the stonewalling pressure being heaped on the Trump administration by the liberal media and the Democrats in this case would be official White House policy.

The very first victim of the fire to be named was 23-year-old Mohammad Alhajali, who had escaped the horrors of the Syrian Civil War, only to die in a preventable tower block fire for want of basic safety measures. Yet those survivors as yet unknown to authorities, who have taken routes less legal than those pursued by Mr. Alhajali, will be rounded up and set back to war zones, persecution and poverty - simply by dint of being too poor or too desperate to fulfil draconian immigration criteria. It seems arbitrary in the extreme to reserve such words as ‘terrorist’ purely for the Assad regime and ISIL, when our own government is hell-bent on offering up refugees for their charnel houses. The cruelty of this government is so uniform that it is in danger of becoming mundane, normalised by endless inhuman grotesques. Yet successive governments dating back to the Blair era have been complicit in designing the architecture of oppression which has resulted in poor migrant workers being forced to live and die in flammable death traps. Punitive measures such as those announced by the government today - which directly contradict earlier promises of an amnesty - demand a modern-day Sanctuary Movement to provide succour to those most deeply betrayed by Western liberal values.  It all has to go. The whole system is guilty." True text

It’s becoming rapidly clear that a disaster the scale of Grenfell was not just a preventable tragedy, but the inevitable and certain outcome of an unspoken cost-cutting policy enacted by both publically-owned and private landlords which prioritised rent gouging over the most basic tenant safety. Frankly, revolutions have started over much, much lesser crimes. The only rational response to these revelations, and the desperate scrambling cover-up undertaken by the government’s official inquiries - staffed as they are by the very individuals who have attempted to write this tacit policy into explicit deregulation - is a national rent strike of poor and vulnerable tenants, backed to the hilt by the organisations of the working-class.

One area which often goes consistently unexamined is that of public justice. It’s so easy, and satisfying, to perceive and injustice and say ‘x should be locked up’. Why is it that we demand the use of punitive capitalist state sanctions against individuals, which themselves have been practised against our class in the most prejudicial manner for centuries? Does it satisfy us to turn those same oppressive institutions against those who have done us harm? Scratching at a burrowing tick might well feel good, but it doesn’t extract the parasite. It’s an uncomfortable truth that locking people up often resolves little: intractable social problems cannot be solved by changing the guard, throwing the disgraced former officials in prison, and leaving underlying architectures of oppression untouched. Justice must be seen to be done, but examples and public spectacles - often carried out as desperate rearguard actions by disgraced authorities - cannot be mistaken for social revolution. We must address the fundamental conservatism and reaction at the heart of retributive justice, in pursuit of a new, transformative social justice." True text

On top, in order to fend off a government-ending Labour amendment to the Queen’s Speech, she was forced to promise a relaxation in laws governing abortion in Northern Ireland, where it remains illegal: Ulsterwomen seeking abortions in England will no longer be charged, and would receive free treatment.So we have the bizarre spectacle of the architects of austerity willingly shredding the foundations of their anti-working-class ideology, in coalition with a far-right Christian party which has already been forced to sell a lynchpin of its medieval misogyny down the river for a sniff of power.The fact is, the mass of working-class Brits, fed up to the back teeth with decades of neoliberal decline and managed working-class social collapse, are already dictating the ruling-class’s agenda."

But retribution is only part of justice. There is no doubt that the families of those who lost their lives deserve the satisfaction of seeing those responsible brought to book. But there’s an unmissable irony in the very same punitive institutions of state claiming to be champions of justice for the 96, when they have spent the better part of thirty years obfuscating and prevaricating so as to throw all public accountability into the long grass. Real justice for the 96 will require fundamental change. It will require addressing the operation of class power in South Yorkshire and elsewhere in the country: how a police force was paramilitarised during the Miners Strike, and given its own fiefdom by a rabidly anti-working-class Tory government; how high-ranking officers gave orders to tamper with evidence and to massage witness statements; how the shady nexus between organised crime, the police and the press facilitated the vilification of the victims of the Disaster; how national politicians, both Labour and Tory, created a deeply classist narrative to prevent the true shame from becoming public currency. As long as the dark corners which contain the answers to those questions remain unscoured, the struggle for justice continues. #JFT96" True text

Like Carson, Arlene Phillips and the DUP have scrambled for the political patronage of the Tories: in 1912, that patronage took the form of carte-blanche political support and guns; in 2017, it takes the form of an effective end to austerity in Northern Ireland. A century ago, Carson’s limitless extremism formed the lynchpin of a strategy to force the embattled Liberal government from power over the issue of Home Rule - autonomous rule for Ireland. Nowadays, the Tory government has, quite literally, bought the ten DUP MPs in order to achieve nothing beyond simply clinging onto political power. But Carson’s dream of retaining a united Ireland within the British Empire was ultimately crushed - the outbreak of the Great War froze the Home Rule Crisis in its tracks, and the revolutionary uprisings in Ireland and across Europe which brought war to a close would ultimately make Irish independence an inevitability. Carson felt the deepest betrayal in the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 - which was overwhelmingly supported by the same Tory MPs who, only a few years before, had rapturously applauded Carson’s determination to oppose Home Rule by force of arms.The Conservative Party, as a party of the landed gentry and the financial aristocracy, remains essentially unchanged in its approach to politics: it willingly indulges the most rabid forms of extremism, but will preserve its own self-interest at all costs. This is the most toxic cocktail, forming both a dry rag and a bottle of high-proof spirit. Whilst it’s most obvious that the DUP will inevitably become an unfortunate casualty Tory ambitions, what must the rest of us - in this country and in the Republic of Ireland - lose in the meantime?Ask | Podcast | Support" True text

The vast majority of the 95 high-rises which are now known to have had deadly flammable cladding fitted were renovated in the previous decade - under Labour governments.

Neither idea - as articulated within the 'official’ forums of public debate in press, media and Parliament - was a comprehensive vision of social transformation. Both became immediately and inevitably subsumed into the contentless war-of-position between neoliberal elites who fundamentally agree with one another on the tenets of post-Thatcher free-market capitalism: the concrete realities of how European states relate to one another and their citizens politically and economically became hopelessly lost, buried amidst debate undertaken on duplicitous premises.  Therefore, it was left up to ordinary folk themselves to project symbolic social content onto these categories which had been hollowed out by meaningless public discussion. On the one hand, in the minds of young, and relatively affluent voters, 'Remain’ became the symbol of anti-racism, cosmopolitanism, and global community; whilst for precarious, generally older workers, 'Leave’ became a nostalgic shibboleth associated with encompassing public welfare institutions, state-managed economics and a hazy, monocultural notion of social empowerment. Given this poorly defined, culturally relative plane of public debate, it’s no wonder at all that class allegiances shattered, with new political cleavages opening up between generations, party loyalties and cultural outlooks. The only way to comprehend, and ultimately to navigate the Brexit from the perspective of working-class interests is to nail it firmly to the deck. We must fill those empty social containers. What does Brexit have to look like to guarantee our collective interests? Nationalisation of the large financial institutions, the refoundation of the British welfare state, the unilateral withdrawal from NATO and nuclear disarmament, a strongly anti-racist migration policy.  Brexit is not a cultural quest for self-knowledge. It is a political question about power, resources and which class wields them." True text
