So when Donald Trump promised not to make any cuts to Social Security, he was lying—shocking, I know—because Social Security Disability is a very big part of Social Security. It’s the same program. Paul Ryan would have been a homeless and destitute child if the government didn’t give his father’s SSDI to him and his mother after his father died. (and yeah, I hate Paul Ryan as much as the next guy, but millions of children face the same circumstances he did, and they don’t deserve any cuts to SSDI) Social Security is not some unearned “entitlement” that the government is “giving” away to undeserving lazy people either.

Like, people forget that she’s only 23 years old and was also targeted? This guy picked HER concert, and that’s for to fuck you up.  She heard the screams of the injured and the dying, and she’s actively blaming herself because - in her mind - had she not performed those people might still be alive and well. Ariana and her team worked tirelessly to help the scared, the frightened and the injured. Corralling lost and terrified children backstage and making sure they were safe.  People complaining that “it’s not about her” (well, news flash, it was. This person likely wanted someone who was popular enough to draw a big enough crowd and do the most damage), and how she shouldn’t cancel her tour are heartless monsters. So what if you lose some money? Some parents are coming home to permanently empty beds. Some people have lost limbs. Children had their innocence and childhood ripped away from them far too soon, and will never be free again. And Ariana? She’s probably PETRIFIED of performing again. Wouldn’t you be if someone detonated a BOMB whilst you were working? If someone murdered children at your show?  I think Ariana is incredibly talented and has an amazing range, but will I be sad/angry/frustrated if she cancelled her tour and/or ended her career? No. Because she’s a fucking PERSON who has been through an extremely traumatic event. To those of you moaning and bitching about potential cancellations, shame on you. " False text

Without net neutrality rules, Comcast could have censored the site outright. Digital rights group Fight for the Future has received a cease and desist order from Comcast’s lawyers, claiming that Comcastroturf.com - a pro-net neutrality site encouraging Internet users to investigate an astroturfing campaign likely funded by the cable lobby - violates Comcast’s “valuable intellectual property.” The letter threatens legal action if the domain is not transferred to Comcast’s control. “This is exactly why we need Title II net neutrality protections that ban blocking, throttling, and censorship,” said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, “If Ajit Pai’s plan is enacted, there would be nothing preventing Comcast from simply blocking sites like Comcastroturf.com that are critical of their corporate policies,” she added. “It also makes you wonder what Comcast is so afraid of? Are their lobbying dollars funding the astroturfing effort flooding the FCC with fake comments that we are encouraging Internet users to investigate?” The legal notice can be viewed here. It claims that Comcastroturf.com violates the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act and infringes on Comcast’s trademarks. Of course, these claims are legally baseless, since the site is clearly a form of First Amendment protected political speech and makes no attempt to impersonate Comcast.  (See the case “Bosley Medical Institute vs. Kremer” which held that sites critical of a company’s practices could not be considered trademark infringement.) Comcastroturf.com encourages Internet users to search the Federal Communication Commission (FCC)’s docket to check if a fake comment was submitted using their name and address to attack Title II based net neutrality protections. It has been widely reported that more than 450,000 of these comments have been submitted to the FCC – and as a result of the site at Comcastroturf.com, Fight for the Future has heard from dozens of people who say that anti-net neutrality comments were submitted using their personal information without their permission. We have connected individuals with Attorneys Generals and have called for the FCC act immediately to investigate this potential fraud. “Companies like Comcast have a long history of funding shady astroturfing operations like the one we are trying to expose with Comcastroturf.com, and also a long history of engaging in censorship,” said Greer, “this is a perfect example of why we need bright line net neutrality rules that protect our free speech online, and why we can’t just trust Internet Service Providers to behave when they’ve abused their power time and time again.” Fight for the Future has no intention of taking down Comcastroturf.com, and would be happy to discuss the matter with Comcast in court. ###  We keep having to fight the same battle, again and again, and these companies just won’t stop trying to get the law changed in their favor, no matter how many times the voting public makes their will known.

Did you actually know that gun rights are for everyone and not just white people? Minorities use guns for protection too! Women use guns for protection! Not just your “good ol’ country boys.”  You know why you don’t get gun violence in places like that? Because criminals are probably less likely to attack someone who they know can and will fight back. It’s not that deep.

You will never change the minds of the right wing, this is about communicating with the American Public in general. As you could see in this most recent election, there are many people that will never vote for the Democrat, no matter how toxic the Republican candidate is. On the other hand, 43% of the voting population are “Independent Voters” (there are many articles outlining how they are not really independent, but in general they do not vote for only one party even though they may tend to vote for one party more often than the other)These are the people that are needed to be convinced that your policies will work for them. They are willing to vote for either party even if they tend to vote primarily in one direction.

[Contempt is] certainly one of the avenues that we could pursue,” Burr told three reporters on Monday evening. “It does us no good to have people insist on pleading the Fifth if you’re out trying to get information. The only thing I can tell you is immunity is off the table.”Burr said Flynn’s denial of his request is nonsensical.“All I’ve asked him for is documents. I don’t know how you can plead the Fifth on a document request,” he said.Read more here" False link

He noted that the “irony is glaring” that the tape proved so damaging to his career while Trump, who actually made the inflammatory comments while Bush chuckled, went on to win the presidency in spite of it.Trump offered a rare apology for his remarks on the tape and chalked them up to “locker room talk,” a characterization that Bush disputed.“I’m in a lot of locker rooms, I am an athlete, and no, that is not the type of conversation that goes on or that I’ve participated in,” he said.Instead, Bush told The Hollywood Reporter, Trump’s comments were typical of the Manhattan billionaire. Bush was unable to recall another instance of the now-president speaking quite so inappropriately about women, “but he’s a provocateur. Shocking statements flow like wine from him.”Read more here" False link

Shaub Jr., the head of the Office of Government Ethics, asking him to withdraw a request he had sent to every federal agency for copies of the waivers. In the letter, the administration challenged his legal authority to demand the information.Dozens of former lobbyists and industry lawyers are working in the Trump administration, which has hired them at a much higher rate than the previous administration. Keeping the waivers confidential would make it impossible to know whether any such officials are violating federal ethics rules or have been given a pass to ignore them.Mr. Shaub, who is in the final year of a five-year term after being appointed by President Barack Obama, said he had no intention of backing down. “It is an extraordinary thing,” Mr. Shaub said of the White House request. “I have never seen anything like it.”Marilyn L. Glynn, who served as general counsel and acting director of the agency during the George W. Bush administration, called the move by the Trump White House “unprecedented and extremely troubling.”" False link

But the backlash also brought a certain phenomenon to wider public attention – the fact that women sometimes wear headphones as a way to avoid unwanted approaches in public. The public conversation on violence against women tends to focus on sexual assault and domestic abuse. We talk less about the routine intrusions women experience from men in their everyday lives, even though this is the most common form of sexual violence. " False link
