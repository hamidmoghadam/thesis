I am a 27 year old woman who is disabled and has autism, ADHD, and anxiety, as well as bouts of depression. My husband is also autistic, has ADHD, depression, as well as physical disabilities. He helps me test the products for my shop as well as think of new items and sometimes helps create them.I am currently mostly working from stuff from my craft hoard, as I am starting from nothing. For now all the profit from my shop is used to expand the inventory. Once I have more financial freedom, I want to have a better focus on providing discrete stim tools to help those that may not be able to stim freely in their environment for whatever reasons. If this sounds like you, and you’re looking for a certain type of stim item, let me know and I can try to find something that works with you!" True text

Some of the best ones can only be found online, but sometimes it’s more convenient (for whatever reason) to buy them in person. With some creativity and a good eye you can find great stim toys almost anywhere. That having been said, here are some of my favorite places to shop for them: Target: There is always something to fidget with at Target. Check the dollar spot, the party favor section, and the party favor/generic cheap things area of the toy section. Sometimes puzzles and games can be repurposed for stimming as well. I’ve also heard that the baby section has chewable items.Stop&Shop: The toy section has playdoh and squishy things! Silicone pot holders are also great stim toys.Claire’s: Depends on the day because their stock rotates quickly, but they can have stretchy wristbands (coiled or otherwise), tactile pens and device cases, and other stuff. Specialty Toy Stores: A lot of these places will have stuff like Thinking Putty, pop toobs, stress balls, wooden fidgets, and fancy games/puzzles that have parts that can be taken to fidget with. Oftentimes blind bag items (such as Mashems/Fashems) can be used for fidgeting while bearing the likeness of your favorite character!  Specialty Bookstores: Depends on the store, but book stores that have toy sections often carry fidget items or puzzles/games that can be used as such. Any store with a Toysmith Kiosk: This category often falls under the above two. As a kid, all my fidgets came from toysmith displays. Nowadays you can even get Tangle Juniors in some of them. There is something for every fidgeter at one of these. Drugstores: This one can be a hit-or-miss, but I’ve seen stress balls and squishy seasonal items at CVS and independent drugstores.Tourist trap souvenir/junk shops:These places often carry stress balls, weighted animals, fidgety pens, or practical joke items that can be repurposed for your needs. Museum Shops: You can find Tangles, themed rubix cubes, hand puzzles, and other handmade or local fidget toys here. Science museums often carry physics toys, slime, or squishy dinosaurs/the like. Pro tip: you can enter most museum shops without buying a ticket to the museum. Happy Stimming/Fidgeting!

My executive dysfunction keeps me from being able to start this the way I need to. My alexithymia keeps me from being able to string the words I want together to properly express myself the way I want. My sensory processing disorder keeps pulling away my focus so that what words I could put together get jumbled or forgotten. I have my days here and there where I’m clear-headed and focused, where I have the ‘spoons’ to write the way I want to. But those are few and far between. That’s what this challenge has been for me, is pushing myself to do something through the veil that autism drapes over my focus. I could only write on ‘good’ days. But at the same time, I want to put myself out there as I actually am. It can be frustrating reading through other people’s work and it’s all well worded and clear. I want to show that this is most days. Coping, de-stressing, struggling ‘to word’. Squeezing out a few words every minute, then re-reading everything, a few more words, and re-reading. Staring at everything for several minutes, trying to find the next word. It’s taken me an hour to get this far.This is me, writing with Autism. This is most days. Some days are better, some days are worse. If I can’t write like the other bloggers most of the time, that’s fine. If I can’t put out content of that caliber as often, that’s fine. I will do what I can when I can and put out the best effort I’ve got.I am Autism. And I’m fine with that." True text

First it was marbles, then later beanie babies, and then Pokemon cards. Then after high school I got into collecting anime figures, mostly figma and Nendoroids (anything with poseable/swappable parts really). When I still lived with my parents, I started running out of space for figures. After moving out I have even less space, so most of my collection has been packed away. I am currently working on ‘curating’ my collection and downsizing by selling off the ones that don’t make the cut on ebay. I haven’t actually gotten a figure in about a year because I just don’t have the money or the space. I would like for my collection to focus on Legend of Zelda and Saber from Fate/Stay Night. As far as Sabers go I have most of them, but I’ve gotten a little behind on the Zelda figures (I only have figma Skyward Sword Link and Nendoroid Wind Waker Link).I also really like to collect information.

So today’s topic will be about things about autism that make my life better, or things I enjoy or appreciate more because I’m autistic. I’ve talked before about how my ability to hyperfocus can be incredibly useful, and I actually really enjoy using this ‘skill’. My hyperfocus allows me to accomplish things that would otherwise go undone as no one else really has any patience. I also feel like I get more enjoyment out of tv shows and video games. Minecraft, for example, I could play almost endlessly. It’s a perfect blend that just matches me perfectly. When I don’t have the spoons to do one task in game, I can work on something else. I can build a giant castle when I feel creative, or just farm and build up resources to trade with villagers. I’m always getting some sense of productivity out of the game. I can also listen to the same song for a month straight, so I don’t have to find new music constantly!This post didn’t end up as good as I hoped because it’s been a rather overloading day, I may revisit it in the future.

I really want a sense of community, which is part of why I started my shop and this blog.

And when I did, I wasn’t firm enough I guess so my concerns were just brushed aside. I was a mostly good student until around 5-6th grade, with 95-100% grades. Then multiplication tables hit, and I hit a wall. I just couldn’t get a handle on them, and instead of stopping to actually help me through it, I was brushed to the side again and class just kept passing me by, with me getting further and further behind. This should have been a sign to someone that some sort of intervention was needed, but no one seemed to care to do anything but blame it on me. And instead of being held back, “No Child Left Behind” kept forcing me through grades so I coasted up to 12th grade with F-filled report cards and essentially a 5th grade education. Not only that, but we had moved during my high school years and most of what passing classes I did have weren’t even at the new school so I lost all of the credits. This overall meant that not only would I need to pass my current classes to graduate, but I needed roughly 2 more years worth of credits. Between that and the bullying becoming worse again, I begged my dad to let me drop out.I definitely believe now that my autism is why I had so much problem in school both socially and academically. I honestly think “No Child Left Behind” needs to be done away with, as it doesn’t really help anyone. If a student is struggling in school, a ‘free pass’ isn’t the answer (and trust me when I say that that’s what a lot of the failing students see it as). If a student is failing, the reasons WHY should be investigated, instead of trying to bribe/guilt them into “getting over it”. " True text

Being autistic himself, he understands me better than anyone else ever has (and it works the other way around too). We’re both sort of still learning how to deal with all this autism stuff, but having our combined efforts towards it makes it go a lot smoother I think!

Which mostly happens while shopping at places like Wal-Mart, with how crowded the aisles can get and people constantly having a ‘goal’ of where they want to go.When I met my husband, our first date was at an anime convention. I actually really enjoyed the crowds there for the most part. It was all just positive energy with no one ‘needing’ to go anywhere.

It’s actually hard to type because it’s going on right now. We have a tv out in the living room with surround sound blasting, while mom tries to cook and yells across the house over the tv to dad who is hard of hearing and yells back… and then every dog in the neighborhood barks constantly while the children in the street scream at each other. And then mom pops in occasionally to ask random questions that I don’t know the answer to because I can’t really think? She wants to set up a doctor’s appointment for me but I’m not really sure if I’m comfortable with it or not because I can’t even think?I’ve been picking the skin on my lips constantly until they bleed because it’s my default stress/overload coping thing. Stim toys help with regulating, but most don’t do too much to help with overload. The best thing I can do for overload is to get away from the situation or make it stop, but that is rarely if ever an option. My Klixx probably helped the most, but I lost it, and the clicking would probably get on everyone’s nerves. Headphones don’t do much unless everyone actually leaves me alone, which is pretty rare. My husband often tries to help me when I start having sensory overload, but sometimes I’m already sort of in a meltdown and don’t really let him help. :(" True text

To the far right, the spinner with three arms attached in a ‘y’ pattern.] You can order one for as low as $15 during the Indiegogo campaign, and they will retail later for $24. But the important part is FREE SHIPPING WORLDWIDE. That means countries like Australia with it’s ridiculous shipping prices? You all have such limited access to things as it is, this is possibly an amazing opportunity. I wanted to be sure you all were aware of this, as it’s pretty much the price of JUST shipping anything to Australia.  Please share and spread this around so that anyone who wants to can take advantage of this! Also, as it is now they will come with an extra bearing, so you might be able to DIY an extra spinner! If they hit $200k raised, they will be including a high-quality plastic tri-spinner as well, which usually go for $15 on their own.  Last chance to order at the $15 mark! There is less than 3 days left of the campaign. Unfortunately it doesn’t seem we’ll make the stretch goal, but $15 for just the brass spinner is still an amazing deal, especially to international customers. After the campaign, they’ll raise to the full price of $24, and I’m not sure how they’ll handle shipping after that. They’ve said that they’ll be shipping out at the end of April.
