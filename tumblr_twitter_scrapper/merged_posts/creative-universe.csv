You might have heard of it, but the election of our next President is currently taking place in France, so I’ll write this quick words, in both English and French, in hope that a lot of you will read it. This is me begging you to go vote on May 7th. I kept scrolling on twitter today and all I could see was hashtags terrifying me. #JamaisMacron (Never Macron) #SansMoiLe7Mai (Without me on May 7th)…On April 25th, we voted for 2 candidates. Despite our hopes, the two names that came out were Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen. You might not know them if you’re not french, but both those names held different stories. While, yes, Emmanuel Macron is a guy that can’t keep his mind straight, change his words every five seconds, is said to be too young to be President, have some « peculiar »  and stupid ideas , he is nothing compared to Le Pen. She is the leader of the far right, the « Front National », and she is a fraud. a political leader behind a party you should be scarred of. Racist, antisemitic, homophobic, anti-immigration, anti-multiculturalism are some of the words that could be used to describe them. Truth is, I don’t want either of them to become my President, but we have to put pride and hatred aside. We are French, guys, we are free, we are a nation, we are a beautiful madness, WE are France.Terrorists attacks can’t divide us. I know I’m scarred, I don’t feel safe, and I don’t trust our politicians, but never, NEVER, will I give up my freedom and my identity to elect someone like Marine Le Pen. No, she’s not Hitler, she’s not the devil, she’s just a woman, a human being, and we have the power to keep her from ruling our country. That won’t be done by sitting on your couch on May 7th, or by giving an empty envelope when you’ll go vote, or by putting the hashtag « Sans Moi le 7 Mai ». You have more than a right to vote, you have an obligation, toward yourself and toward your country. You might not like it, you might hate Macron even, but you have a voice, and we all know one voice can change everything. So go vote on May 7th, vote for Emmanuel Macron, not because you like him, or because you like his ideas, but because giving him your voice means blocking the way to a party that will destroy our country, our beliefs and most certainly our life. Please, please, please, don’t sit this one out. Go vote, because if you don’t, then you’ve made your choice, you chose the National Front and everything it stands for. It’s not voting for, but voting against. Who’d you rather have, a weird liberalist with no party and early alzheimer (and a very bad way with words), or a woman who’s going to destroy everything being french means ? It is not easy, but necessary. Choose life, guys, choose France. With all my love, a very concerned french citizen. ——————————————————————————————————-Salut tous le monde, je ne parle normalement jamais de politique, mais cette fois c’est vraiment, vraiment, vraiment, vraiment important. Je vous supplie d’aller voter le 7 Mai. Toute la journée, je n’ai vue que des hashtags qui m’ont fait atrocement peur sur twitter; #JamaisMacron - #SansMoiLe7Mai …Le 25 Avril, on a voté pour 2 candidats. Malgré nos espoirs, les deux noms qui en sont ressortis sont ceux d’Emmanuel Macron et de Marine Le Pen. Vous ne les connaissez peut-être pas si vous n’êtes pas français, mais ce sont deux noms avec deux histoires bien différentes.Il est vrai qu’Emmanuel Macron est un homme qui n’a pas l’esprit clair, qui change de mots et d’avis toutes les cinq secondes, qui est dit trop jeune pour être Président, et qui a clairement quelques stupides idées très « particulières », mais il n’est rien comparé à Le Pen.Elle est le leader de l’extrême droite, le Front National, et c’est une arnaque à elle seule, un leader politique derrière un partie dont vous devriez avoir peur. Racisme, antisémitisme, homophobe, anti-immigration, anti-multiculturalisme sont quelques mots qui pourraient bien les décrire. La vérité étant que je ne veux qu’aucun des deux ne devienne mon(ma) Président(e), mais nous devons mettre de côté notre fierté et notre haine. Nous sommes français, les gars ! Nous sommes libre, nous sommes une nation, nous représentons une magnifique folie, merde, NOUS sommes la France. Les attaques terroristes ne doivent pas nous diviser. Je sais que j’ai peur, que je ne me sens pas en sécurité, que je ne fais pas confiance à nos politiciens, mais jamais, JAMAIS, je ne renoncerais à ma liberté et mon identité pour élire quelqu’un comme Marine Le Pen. Non, elle n’est pas Hitler, elle n’est pas le diable, elle est simplement une femme, un être humain, et nous avons le pouvoir de l’empêcher de gouverner notre pays. Ca ne se fera pas en restant assis sur votre canapé le 7 Mai, ni en rendant une enveloppe vide lorsque vous irez voter, ni même en écrivant ce fameux hashtag « Sans Moi le 7 Mai ».Vous avez plus qu’un droit de voter, vous avez une obligation, envers vous-même et envers votre pays. Vous n’aimez peut-être pas ça, vous détestez peut-être même Macron, mais vous avez une voix, et nous savons tous qu’une seule voix peut faire toute la différence. Alors allez voter le 7 Mai, votez pour Emmanuel Macron, pas parce que vous l’appréciez lui, ou même ses idées, mais parce que lui donner votre voix veut dire bloquer la route à un partie qui pourrait détruire notre pays, nos croyances et probablement même nos vies. S’il vous plaît, à tous ce qui lisent ce mots et ont le pouvoir de bouger les choses, à tous les français, ne faites pas l’impasses sur ces élections. Allez voter, parce que ne pas le faire, c’est déjà faire un choix, le choix du Front National et de tous ce qu’il soutient. Rappelez vous que ce n’est pas voter pour, mais voter contre. Qui préférez-vous, un libéraliste étrange, sans partie avec un alzheimer précoce, ou une femme qui pourrait détruire tous ce qu’être français veut dire ? Ce n’est pas facile mais nécessaire. Choisissez la vie, les gars, choisissez la France. Avec tout mon amour, une citoyenne française très inquiète. " True text

No, I haven’t forgotten about you but life got crazy between college and work (yes, I got a job too now) and I have less and less time to write, but I’m still doing my best, which is why I’m posting this small section of my upcoming imagine, I can’t give you any date yet because it’s still a work in progress, but know I’m really trying to write new things and post it. In the meantime, here’s one scene from my very first Jordan Parrish imagine. Please comment, tell me what you think of it, and enjoy. Love you all ! ;) The Hellhound: Between Heaven and Hell (Jordan Parrish imagine)« I’m not here to fight, Jordan » She whispered.« Good, because I’m not gonna change my mind »She sighed, leaning on his desk. She knew it was useless to push him. He had always been like that with her, cold, distancing himself from the undeniable attraction between them. He was the kindest and most reliable person she had met, but with her, every of his emotions were masked, trapped under a fear he could not voice out loud. « Can I ask you something ? » She said. « … Something personal »« Go ahead »He crossed his arms, waiting for her to speak. « I know I’m not the only one feeling whatever it is there is between us … »« Y/N … » He tried to cut her, to stop the words before they become too real.« … I’m falling for you, Jordan. That’s no secret for anyone, even for you. »He didn’t dare to look at her, he knew he wouldn’t like what he’d find. She was tired, tormented by invisible emotions she could no longer control. She was conflicted, she knew coming to him would unquestionably hurt, it was either confessing their forbidden feelings, or stay away in pain. « You shouldn’t say that. We shouldn’t be talking about that » He muttered. « I’m not going to leave this room until we do »« Y/N … it’s … it’s complicated, you know that »« Then uncomplicated it! » She raised her voice. He pursed his lips.« I … » He began.« Nobody can hear you, Jordan, so stop being so cautious and say what you have to say ! »« … I can’t » He whispered. « Why ? I’m eighteen, so what’s the matter, deputy ? I’m not breaking any of your precious law, and neither are you! » She got angry, spitting her words with venom. « Y/N … » He warned her.She walked to him, hopelessly trying make him say anything at this point. The frustration floated around them. He was scarred of feeling, she, of waiting in vain for her heart to break. « Is it why you don’t want to get involved ? » She pushed him, desperate to get a reaction from him « Because of judgment ? Because even the slightest part of you reciprocate my feelings ? »« Slightest ? » He repeated, suddenly animated by a passion he tried so hard to ignore. « Is that what you think ? That only a slightest part of me might think of you as more than a friend ? »« I don’t know what I think, Jordan ! » She shouted. « How could I know when all you do is to avoid me like the plague! »He didn’t answer, it was useless. He knew she was right. « Make up your mind and stop playing with my feelings » She continued.« I’m not playing, Y/N » He vehemently answered. « I could never do anything to hurt you »« Too late for that » She spitted.She felt somehow satisfied yet disturbed when she saw the sadness in his eyes. He tried to make a move, to reach for her hand, a simple touch that would bring them closer, closer than they’ve ever been. He wanted her to see, just for a second, how much he cared, how deeply her pain was affecting him. « You deserve more than I can offer » He dropped his head, his sincerity shaking her to the core.« I never asked for more, Jordan »He sighed, brushing his hand against her cheek. She closed her eyes, savoring their proximity while it lasted.« You have no idea how hard it is to stay away from you » He murmured. « Then don’t… »« I wish it’d be that easy »« I wish you’d care enough for it to be easy »He didn’t dare to tell her just how wrong she was, didn’t dare to admit he would die to protect her if he had to. He stood there, silent, the words on the tip on his mouth as she grabbed her bag and slammed the door.If you have any Jordan Parrish request, click –> here , and don’t worry, the rest of this story is coming … Tag: jennymagicalheart - badgirlsdeaddreams" True text

What do we do first ? Cry, make fun of the helplessly useless prick or get drunk ? Although that last bit might be a problem for me … » He stated, walking into her apartment without any hesitation and setting his bags on the table.The woman closed the door and went back under the blanket on the sofa without a word. She heard him giggle and felt him kneel in front of her.« Y/N ? » He gently called.« Please, don’t say I told you so » She whispered, a tear escaping my eye as she turned away from him.He softly smiled, brushing his finger against her cheek« I won’t. I didn’t come for that »« Who told you ? »« Iris » He answered in a laugh, as if it was obviously gonna be her. « Why didn’t you want to tell me, Y/N ? »He sounded so hurt and she hated herself for being the cause of his sudden sadness.« Did she tell you what happened ? » She asked.« No. Only that you and … » He stopped, his eyebrows furrowing. « I shouldn’t say his name. That’s kind of a girl thing, right ? Banning the boy’s name forever and condemning his spirit to endless tortures? »The woman chuckled, shaking her head at his childish behavior. « She told me you guys broke up » He said seriously.« Yeah, that pretty much sum it up. » She answered, biting her lips. She didn’t know if telling him was a good idea or not. « I left him »He seemed surprise to hear it was her who ended the relationship but didn’t comment on that.« What happened ? » He inquired. « Last time I checked, you were on your way to Keystone to spent the week-end with him »« I was »She got up, making some space next to her for him to sit.« We … He … » Again, she brushed the tears quickly, mad at herself for getting so worked up by that. « I should have listened to you, Barry »« What did he do ? Did he hurt you ? » He asked, his voice filled with possessiveness and anger as he took her hand in his.« He cheated on me … I found him in bed with … with this … drop dead gorgeous woman » When he didn’t say anything, she kept talking. « I mean, I know I’m not the most perfect girlfriend a man could hope for but … »She abruptly stopped talking, swallowing back her pain. The tears fell freely on her cheek as the silence was suddenly broken by her sobs. She couldn’t help but feel heartbroken. Sure, she didn’t love the guy to no end but she trusted him, she trusted his loyalty. Knowing he had been with another woman behind her back made her feel worthless. She was so mad at herself for letting him have such an impact on her, for caring.Barry didn’t hesitate a second before enveloping the young woman in his arms. He let her cry for a moment, his heart breaking a little more every time a new sob escaped her lips. He surprised himself thinking about how that guy could even have imagine cheating on someone like Y/N. She was perfect to Barry, from her fantastic curves to her amazing personality. She was his idea of perfection and he would have told her so if she hadn’t met the douchebag, if he hadn’t lost all courage when she grew fond of him. It had been so hard to see them together each time, knowing he was falling harder and harder for the young woman as days passed by. After only a couple minutes, he moved back, cupping her face between his hands.« Listen to me, Y/N » He vehemently spoke. « That guy do not deserve you. You are … everything … everything a man could ask for, and more. He was too blind to realize how amazing you are. You can’t let that get to you, you can’t let it change the way you see yourself. You are incredible, breathtaking and even more beautiful each day. Damn, Y/N, I just have to look at you and my heart starts pounding like no tomorrow »She tilted her head, bewildered, looking right back into his eyes, trying to determine if he was lying or not. « You’re my friend, you’re not supposed to say that » She murmured. « I don’t want to be your friend, Y/N… »He shook his head before bending toward her and lightly kissed her forehead. She felt a shiver running through her body and instinctively reached for his wrists. « I should’ve told you that a long time ago » He muttered.When he starred back at her, she could see the hesitation in his gaze, but also the sincerity. Barry was an open book. He could not hide anything, not to her, and she could see him burning with emotions, she could feel it. Closing her eyes, she patiently waited for his next words.« Now is not a good time » He admitted.« Say it » She demanded.It was in the way he was looking at her, the way she felt his body twitch when she told him about her now ex-boyfriend, the way he had softly kissed her skin only seconds ago. All small movements which, all together, meant much more than friendship for the both of them.« Y/N … » He hesitated.« Say it, Barry » She breathed. He gave her one last look, took a deep breath and waited until she opened her eyes to talk.« I love you » He whispered.There it was, finally out of his chest and did it felt amazing to say it out loud.« I wasn’t going to say anything about it because, well… you know. » He started. « You changed everything. I remember the day you walked into CC Jitters and spilled your coffee on me. The moment I looked at your face, I knew I was done. You bewitched me, you still do, every single day. But then … then you called me your friend and that’s … that’s what I was to you, what I still am. You just … you’re a friend that’s made me laugh a little louder, smile a little bigger and made me want to live a little bit better. »« You never said anything » She whispered, brushing frankly a newly flow of tears on her face. « I was afraid you’d run away » He admitted. « That you’d disappear and I’d be left with nothing but the memory of how I screwed up everything »« Barr … »« You need to understand, Y/N, I’m not saying any of this to make things complicated. I decided to keep it to myself when I saw you growing closer with that guy and, yes, it hurt me, but you were happy, so I let you go. Now, now I can see how much damage he did and you need to know he didn’t love you, not like I do. He never saw you the way I see you, never felt this … this need to protect you. He never realized what he had while I knew exactly what I was losing. »« Barry… »« Let me finish, please. I need to get this out, even if it ruins our friendship. I wanted to tell you about the Flash, so many times, I didn’t want you to find out the day I saved you. I thought that maybe … maybe then you’d fall in love with me, that maybe I’d be good enough. I know how that feel, to be disappointed by the person you simply are, and I know this is how you feel right now, but you gotta know that, to me, you are perfect. He doesn’t know it yet but he lost the most precious woman he could ever laid eyes on. You are … Y/N, I love you. My god, I love you so much … »He shook his head, as if to clear his mind and she let out a strangled sob before rushing into his arms and hugging him as tight as she could. For a moment startled, he didn’t move, before slowly enveloping his arms around her petite body. It felt more than amazing for the both of them, pure and free. Her body pressed into his soft and warm chest, she was safe, and loved.« Did I ruin everything ? » He brokenly whispered.She chuckled, moving back and brushing her tears before strocking his cheek affectionately. « No, Barry. You didn’t »« So, you still want to be my friend ? »« No »He dropped his head, looking like a lost puppy and she grabbed his chin, forcing him to look back at her.Without a word, she came closer, slowly, intimately. First, it was a brush, their lips so close. Innocently, passionately, finally.« Y/N.. » He whispered.She smiled, his heart hammering inside his chest at the simplest sight. Clasping his hands on either side of her face, he leaned in, slowly. At last, his lips captured hers and the world around them suddenly stopped. Soft, almost like a feather, a comforting touch, his thumb sweetly caressed her cheek as their breaths mixed together. They were so close she could feel his heartbeat from the tips of her fingers.Just as slowly, they moved back. Not wanting to be one more moment apart from her, Barry put his forehead against hers, taking a deep breath.« Does that mean … » He started.« I always thought you loved Iris » She smiled.« Okay, for the record, that crush was like, years ago » He stated, making her laughed.He pecked her lips, one, two, three times, earning a giggle and a blush from the woman.« I’m sorry, I can’t … » He shook his head, once more kissing her. « I can’t get enough of that »She smiled.« Dork » She rolled her eyes.He bursted out laughing, making her giggle again. « Are you sure this is what you want ? » He asked seriously. « Isn’t it too fast ? »She smirked.« Did you know, Barry Allen, that I was ready to ask you on a date that day I spilled coffee on you ? »« You were ? »« Yes »« Why didn’t you ? »« Iris joined you and you … you guys looked too close to be just friends so I backed off »He seemed surprised by her admission.« So, you mean … this could have happen a long time ago ? »He laughed, throwing his head back.« I can’t believe it! I waited all this time, thinking you’d never like me when …. »« When I was thinking the exact same thing about you » She cut him. « Quite the pair we make »He smirked, leaning back on the couch, an arm around her waist to drag her with him.
