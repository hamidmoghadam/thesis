(I know you readers wanted smut, so here ya’ll go! <3<< Prev Word count: 1,441—————————————————————————————————-“Your father,” The members and you sit in a circle inside the living room, and Yoongi pauses to clear his throat, before crossing his legs. “Your father is a very dangerous man. Sells drugs, does drugs, owns properties. He’s so powerful, he practically rules every single gang there is. He overrules everyone. A king, to put it bluntly.” You pull at the strings of the over used pillow sat on your lap, never looking up into his eyes. “How long.” You bluntly spoke, and Jungkook suddenly cracks his knuckles, coughing. “His whole life, basically.” You nodded. You wanted to cry. You wanted to scream and hit your father, you wanted to make him suffer for what he’s become. Your father used to be such a good man, and that whole time you thought he was good, it turned out he was just like everyone else. “Y/N.” You struggled not to cry, and gripped the pillow, knuckles turning ghostly white and lifted up your head, lip being harshly bit from your teeth. “Yes?” Namjoon’s eyes wander to every members glances, and he finally lands on your gaze. “The reason why you’re here, is because your father owes us money.” You shook your head, lip still being bit and wiped your eyes quickly before any tears could fall, and took a deep breath. “We’ve already established that, you moron.” You bit back, and his eyes suddenly turned almost black, clearly angry with your sudden attitude. “I won’t hesitate to hurt you again.” He struggled not to get up and hold you close, and tell you everything’s okay from what he had just previously said. But he couldn’t, no. He was a ruthless gang member. “Your father gathers money from us, pays the government that money, and in return, gets more money. You see, he was supposed to pay us the payment of 566050377 won, and he never gave it. And well, we needed to do what we needed to do.”You dug your nails into your bare thighs, only wearing a pair of cotton white shorts and a black tank top with white socks. “You kidnapped an innocent FUCKING girl?” You enunciated the curse in your sentence, which made the group thoroughly surprised, and scoffed once again, standing up, walking over to the dining room wood table, and drove your nails into it. “Princess, we had no choice. I’m so sorry.” Jungkooks soft voice trailed through the hallway, which made you look back with widened eyes, a bright smile upon his face. Jungkook was a clear brother figure to you, and the statement made you relax a bit.“Where is my father now?” You whispered, Seokjin slightly rising his head at your question. “We don’t quite know.” Hoseok pulled out a photo from his back pocket, handing it to you. “This was his last sighting.” His voice was soft and relaxing, and almost made you fall asleep. Did he pity you? It was a photo of of your father in what seems to be an old abandoned building? It made your eyebrows furrow together in confusion, and tilt your head. “Where is this?” You asked quietly, incertitude lacing in your voice. “His gang home, I’m assuming.” You nodded slowly, trying to comprehend every little detail they had explained to you. “You know you can leave, right?” Hoseok whispered under his breath, so that the other members could not hear him. You turned your head towards him, excitement beaming in your eyes.Did you want to leave? Did you want to leave this family you had learned to love and care as if they were your own? Jungkook. Namjoon? You had grown feelings for him, and now, they were more powerful than ever, and it made you embarrassed and couldn’t bare to look at his glinting brown eyes.You had to leave. —————————————————————————————————By now, the time was 2:32 AM in the morning, full moon set out and bright outside, and clouds were surrounding it. It was truly a beautiful sight, you thought. Now, it was time to leave. You had gathered all your belongings into a bag Jungkook had given you. The backpack was black, and in pure white writing said, “Fuck off.” in japanese. He said that it had suited you, and ruffled your hair like you were a two year old little girl. You just laughed and hugged him tightly. You slid in onto your back, putting on your black adidas slides, and zipped up your jacket, walking downstairs as quietly as you could. You had gotten down to the bottom, when a voice made you freeze with horror.“I see Hoseok told you.”Your finger nails had tapped your right thigh anxiously, and he noticed this, pulling it away and gripped it tightly, kissing behind your ear. Hands wrapped around your waist tightly, as you both stood in front of a mirror. This action made you bite down on your lower lip, and he chuckled deeply.“I’ll miss this, beautiful.”He gestures to your body, hands trailing up and down your left thigh. You had sighed, not wanting to leave, but you had to, and he pushed you closer to his chest. “We won’t bother you anymore, once you leave, darling.”You looked down at the floor, blood seeping down your lower lip from biting it so hard of being nervous, and he wipes it off, lovingly staring into your eyes. “I’ve developed feelings for you, darling. Hm?” You turned around, suddenly launching into his chest and this action had made both of you land on the black carpeted floor, and he stares up at you. “I have too. But, I have to leave. I have to find my father, figure out why he did this. Why he did this.” You stuttered, managing to get out a full sentence and he brushes a strand of hair behind your ear. “I understand.”He uses his thumb to trace your cheekbone, and it made you blush brightly. “You’re so beautiful, do you know that?” He questions you, staring at his plump lips, and you let your head sink down onto his chest, sighing quietly.“Thank you.”The use of gratitude has him furrowing his eyebrows together and a cheeky smile comes upon his handsome face. “Thank you?” You put your head up, hands resting on top of his white t-shirted chest. “Thank you, for caring about me. I know a lot of the members didn’t like it, considering they beat and abused me.” He looked pitiful, now bringing his hands to cup your cheeks and brought you to his face, gently kissing you, as if you were a delicate porcelain doll. Your kisses with him were loving and soft, almost like candy, sweet. He licked your bottom lip, and you gladly opened up your mouth, his tongue entering your wet cavern.Soft moans and kisses were bouncing off of the walls, and it sent vibrations to your core, moaning softly. “Namjoon.”This gave him a chance to understand your neediness, and pulled back and sat up, grabbing you and carrying you bridal style, his footsteps pattering against the now wooden floor. His room was painted a grayish white, lights placed up on the ceiling, two small windows in front of the bed, a wooden floor and a fur carpet that sat on top of it. It was cozy and nice, and reminded you of your old brothers room. He was dead now, but the memories always came back.—————————————————————————————————-10 minutes had passed by, loud moans and grunts bouncing off the bedroom walls. “Fuck, I’m close darling.” His grunts and moans sent amazing feelings to your core as he pounded into you, hickeys scattered across your neck. “Shit, me too.” He brought his hand down to rapidly rub your bundle of nerves which made you buck your hips, arching your back and moaned. “N-Namjoon!” The sudden gasp and scream of his name had made him roll his hips into yours, shooting cum inside you. This action made you cum, sending rolls of pleasures and shooting stars in your eyes, breathing becoming erratic. Two more thrusts, and he pulled out, throwing the condom into the trash and fell onto your bare chest. “That, was fucking great, baby-girl.” The newly found pet name made you whine, and he laughed. “You like baby-girl.” You nodded embarrassingly, and he pinched your cheeks, then proceeding to peck your nose.Soon, both of you had fallen asleep in each others arms, warmth bundling them up under the covers.She was really in love with him.But how could she love a ruthless gang member, who kills for money?"

Wait up!” Your giggles were heard throughout the playground, bright skies and the sun was as happy as ever. You were set on running after your dad, running with all your might. You were gonna get him! You laughed loudly, bare feet skidding on the sand as your dad ran faster, his black hair blowing in the wind. “Catch me if you can!” He yelled from behind his shoulder, eyes glowing with happiness. Your dad and you had an amazing friendship, and relationship. He meant everything to you. Your father had become quickly distracted, and this gave you the chance to heave yourself onto his back and you squealed. “I got you appa!” You threw your fist in the air out accomplishment. He suddenly becomes eerily quiet, and you tilt your head out of curiosity.“Appa?” He turns his head around with widened eyes, whisking your body onto his back again, and ran into a small hidden corner. “Princess, I need you to be quiet, and can’t say a thing. We’re playing the quiet game. Remember the quiet game?” He whispers harshly, eyes wandering around for the gang member he spotted. You nodded, confused and shut your mouth, sinking to the floor and played with your tiny fingers. Minutes passed by from hearing footsteps and gunshots which made you fear for your life, when it all stopped. “See? The game is over now! Let’s go home.” Your dad smiles nervously, sweat trickling down in beads on his forehead. “Yay!” You had both stopped by a bench, and your father sits down, shoulders hunched and tired, aching feet. You sit down next to him, smiling brightly, as if nothing had just happened a few minutes ago.Your father was a kingpin, the gang leader of all gangs. High and mighty, and when you heard his name, you’d know who he was. You see, when he was a young boy, his mother and father died, and forced him out onto the streets to become a little street rat, who steals food and clothes. But he was found out from a gang, and they took him in, forcing him to become a gang member.He climbed the gang ladder, becoming more powerful and more powerful by that one step. That one mission, that brought him higher to becoming a king. But you? You didn’t know this at all. You were so young, he couldn’t tell you. You wouldn’t be able to comprehend such a complex thing, in your young 10 year old mind set.Your father pulled your small body up, and grinned from ear to ear. “Let’s go home.”———————————————————————————————————–You picked at the rips in your jean shorts, legs crossed with converse on your feet. The gang told you, that if you had joined them and helped them, they’d tell you all about your dad and why the hell he stole money from them. You still knew absolutely nothing.“Up, now. We’ve got another wound you need to clean.” Your eyes wandered up to Jungkook, nodding slowly. Jungkook had become a soft guy, being a brother figure to you. He was the only one who really cared for you. You had been introduced to all of BTS a little while ago.Taehyung, Seokjin, Yoongi, and finally, J-Hope. Taehyung. They were all fearless, but funny and kind boys. And you had grown to care for them. You slipped off your denim jacket, and stood up, Jungkook smiling and kissed your head, leaving.You had gotten close to Namjoon, and developed feelings for him. The bad boy aura from him made you weak in the knees every time you saw him. “Fuck, what happened?” You cursed loudly, the sight of Namjoon’s bloodied, beat up face making you slightly puke in your mouth. He chuckled, blood spewing out his mouth as he coughed. “Turns out he was stronger than me?” You slid your converse off, clearing your throat and grabbing a pair of tweezers, wipe cloths, water, and rubbing alcohol. “Do you mind?” You gestured to his lap, and he shook his head, grinning through bloody teeth, which made you chuckle.You plopped onto his lap, and grabbed the tweezers, slipping a wipe cloth through it, pouring rubbing alcohol onto it and slowly wiped the blood off of his forehead. “Why do you do this?” You asked, sighing loudly, switching the cloth and going over to his lips now.He never answered you, he only stared at you with those glinting brown eyes that made me weak to the stomach. You wiped the cloth over his lips, a few bare touches with your fingers and put it down, all wounds cleaned. He bit his lower lip, grabbing both hips and pulling you down to his lap. “Namjoon?” He never answered you. He trailed his finger down your lips, glazing a finger over it. “Y/N. You have no fucking idea, how worked up you get me.” He growled, the sudden deepness of his voice sending tingles to your core. Shaky breaths fell out of your mouth, and he suddenly kissed you.Eyes widened, gripping his shoulders and kissed him back equally hard. You never expected it, but oh god did you want it. He brought his lips down to your neck, biting your neck harshly, and gently licking it. That’d leave a deadly hickey later on.“Namjoon, f-fuck..” You whimpered, and he flexed his thigh, grinding his hips into yours, which made you moan out loud. A smirk layed upon his face, chuckling deeply. A loud knock from the room door had made you jump, leaping out of his lap and opened the door. “He’s done.” You say, flustered and embarrassed from the previous actions you had just done.Taehyung nods, and you leave.———————————————————————————————————–“Help me understand this. My dad, is a gang leader? Sells and takes drugs, owns properties.. Right?” The shakiness in your voice made Jungkook rub your knee gently, nodding. “I-I don’t understand.”“You will soon, princess.” (THIS WAS SO FUCKING RUSHED I’M SORRRRRRY)" True text

This time, you had been put in a room with burgundy colored walls, black velveted bed-sheets, black furniture, and a body mirror in front of the closet. Whoever had made the room, had an amazing taste in furniture.. you thought. You slipped out of the comfy bed and onto the carpeted floor with bare feet, and you looked at yourself in the mirror. You had tangled brown hair, circles under your eyes which made you look like a raccoon, an over-sized black sweatshirt, white shorts, and a pair of knee high socks. You looked like shit, to put it bluntly. You scoffed at yourself, and quietly opened the door. “Hello?” You bit your lower lip out of a nervous habit. The quietness of the hallway was not helping. “You’re awake, princess.” You jumped at the sudden loudness of a voice, your feet landing farther then where you were before. It was Jungkook, suited with a leather jacket and black shirt, ripped skinny jeans and combat boots. He had a raised eyebrow, smirking. “You’re a skittish one, aren’t you.” He mumbled under his breath. “Where am I, m-may I ask?” You stuttered, unable to get out words from your mouth from being so nervous. He suddenly grabbed a rope piece, pulling your body towards his and picking up your hands. “H-Hey, stop!” He groaned, tying your hands with the rope tightly. “Lets go. Now.” He grabbed your arm harshly, and brought you down the stairs with force. Once you got to the bottom, he let you go and you fell onto the floor, wincing. You looked up, panting and your eyes met with brown eyes and bright pink hair slicked back. “My name is-” You furrowed your eyebrows together, interrupting him. “Namjoon. Kim Namjoon. I k-know who you are.” You stuttered, face flustered with embarrassment. He looked shocked, then quickly went back to his cold, hard face. “Do you know why you’re here?” You twitched with your fingers, staring at the black carpeted floor. “My father stole money. I just don’t understand.” You murmured, and he lifted up your chin with two fingers. “What don’t you understand?” The sudden harsh tone of his voice changed to a softer tone, and had made you relax slightly. “My father would never do such a thing.” You whispered. He tilted his head, another man with mint green hair popping in, and whispering something into Namjoons ear. “Seems as though your father is on another run.” Namjoon smirks, and you tilt your head in curiosity. Namjoon stands up, over-towering you by a foot, yourself only being a mere 5′0 tall. Soon Namjoon and the green haired boy leave. The room is quiet, and relaxing. You slide up from off of the floor and stood up, sitting down on the white couch with fluffy pillows that made you sigh and fall into them. “You shouldn’t be here, princess.” A voice brings you from your thoughts, and you look up. It was Jungkook again, but this time he was in a more casual outfit. You just shook your head and sighed, nose stinging from trying not to cry. He sits down, pulls out a phone, and distracts himself for a while. The sudden thought of your father came to mind. Your father was a very rich man, making millions of dollars, and always lended you hand when in need. But this time, he didn’t. You haven’t spoken to your father in a week now. He just disappeared out of nowhere, with no warning. And so you couldn’t make money, and got a good paying job to pass the time. Where was your father? And why the hell did he leave without saying anything to you? Your fists tightened, nose stinging once again and tears fell from your eyes, covering your mouth with muffled sobs. Jungkook had looked up from his phone, a look of pity upon his eyes. “Princess, are you really that weak, that you have to cry?” He scoffed, rolling his eyes. “I-I’m sorry, it’s just, I haven’t spoken to my father in a while.” You words stumbled out, having a small panic attack at the moment. “He’s so powerful and high mighty, it wouldn’t surprise me.” He laughed slightly. You stopped crying, wiping your tear shed eyes and snorted. “You got the wrong idea. He just works for an electronic company, a medium leveled expert. He isn’t high and mighty, as you put it.”He raised an eyebrow at your response, shaking his head. “Do you have any pictures of your father?” He asked, and you nodded slowly. “It’s in my purse, but you took it, so..” You dragged off the so in your sentence, looking at the intricate artwork placed on the wall. “Give me a moment.”Minutes passed by of staring at the paintings and shining glass windows, and Jungkook came pack with your purse, dropping it into your lap and jumped onto the couch. “You don’t have any guns or knives in there, do you?” He joked slightly, winking. You gave in an annoyed looked, gesturing to yourself. “Look at me.”He gestured to your black bag. “Go on.” You opened your bag, rummaging through it and finally found your wallet, nodding in approval. “Ah ha..” You murmured, opening it up and grabbing the photo of your father, throwing it into Jungkooks lap. “See, that’s my father. You’ve kidnapped the wrong girl, I’m afraid.”He shook his head and scoffed, sighing loudly. “Oh princess, you have no idea.” —————————————————————————————————-" True text
