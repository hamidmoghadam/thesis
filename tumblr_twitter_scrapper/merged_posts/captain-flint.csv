I think we’re supposed to understand imprisonment in Georgia, with Thomas, as the best possible option, because of all the insane shit Flint pulled.  The dead crewmen, the disregard for life, the lying, Charles Town, the dead magistrates, Gates, the rest of it.  A short life chained to the wall of a prison hulk being chewed on by the rats, followed by a hanging, would be the standard outcome, and it would not be unjust by any metric. Even Toby said he was appalled by Flint, even as he was fascinated by him.    But he won us. Even when actively trying, I can barely remember his crimes.  What stands out are his brilliant tactics, his glorious motives, his end to which he justified his means.  The speeches.  The way when his face falls my heart breaks.  That incredible charisma, the humor and intelligence and love. Stephens made him so real, our feelings about him are real, too. So fandom is legitimately angry about the plantation ending, because we’re with him all the way.  We don’t see the imprisonment as justified, no matter how benign, because we’re on his side.  War crimes or not, murder sprees or not, the entire deceased crew of the Walrus notwithstanding, Toby Stephens turned James Flint into someone so incredible, so powerful and human and relatable, that we as his fans and devotees would happily march on Savannah and turn that plantation inside out to set him free.  So if the showrunners ever express surprise that people aren’t universally thrilled about leaving Flint where he is in those last shots, tell them to take it up with Toby.  The man’s a menace.

In addition to starvation, dehydration, brutal and backbreaking work, the lash, 18″ of space to hang your hammock (the allotment of space for each individual of ‘personal’ space), there was also the fact that you could be killed or maimed in battle at any time, lost overboard, or killed in one of the many shipboard accidents.

The way he holds him like something precious. The way this terrifying pirate, who has killed people with his bare hands, holds Thomas as if he’s afraid he might break him. The way he bestows reverent kisses and soft caresses….because despite fitting the very image of a terrifying pirate, he has gentleness left in his soul for Thomas.  I also like to imagine the people at the plantation being all 0_0, because on the one hand, they’ve figured out he’s a pirate, and also he looks like one, what with the stud in his ear and the jewelry and the way he’s dressed and carries himself, but then they see him with Thomas, and they’re so soft. James is so loving. His kisses are kisses of love - they’re not demanding or possessive. He’s not trying to take or to lay a claim, he’s trying to show Thomas how much he’s loved. He holds Thomas like something precious, not like a possession. He protects Thomas from anything and everything. Some claim that they’ve seen James - big, scary, bearded pirate James - sink to his knees and look up reverently at Thomas.  In short, he doesn’t hold Thomas as if Thomas belongs to him, like a possession, like a pirate’s prize. He holds Thomas as if Thomas is an idol, something to worship, something to bestow all the feelings of his soul onto.  " False text

It was Ann) that perhaps a few people would enjoy hearing my thoughts on this election. So I sat down at my computer, cleared my head, and opened a document.  Then I started crying. So I had some hot chocolate, and my close friend (Ann) rubbed my back for a while, and I got myself together, and sat down.  And started crying.  Then more Ann comforting me, and more hot chocolate, and back and forth like that for about six hours or so, the chain of hot-chocolate-and-back-rubs only interrupted briefly when I had to run to the store for more hot chocolate packets (“Just give me all of them, all the boxes,” I remember saying, through tears, to a very scared stockroom boy) and now I am ready to go.   When I was in fourth grade, my teacher Mrs. Kolphner taught us a social studies lesson. The 17 students in our class were introduced to two fictional candidates: a smart if slightly bookish-looking cartoon tortoise named Greenie, and a cool-looking jaguar named Speedy. Rick Dissellio read a speech from Speedy, in which he promised that if elected he would end school early, have extra recess, and provide endless lunches of chocolate pizzandy. (A local Pawnee delicacy at the time: deep fried pizza where the crust was candy bars.) Then I read a speech from Greenie, who promised to go slow and steady, think about the problems of our school, and try her best to solve them in a way that would benefit the most people. Then Mrs. Kolphner had us vote on who should be class president. I think you know where this is going. Except you don’t, because before we voted, Greg Laresque asked if he could nominate a third candidate, and Mrs. Kolphner said “Sure! The essence of democracy is that everyone—“ and Greg cut her off and said, “I nominate a T. rex named Dr. Farts who wears sunglasses and plays the saxophone, and his plan is to fart as much as possible and eat all the teachers,” and everyone laughed, and before Mrs. Kolphner could blink, Dr. Farts the T. rex had been elected president of Pawnee Elementary School in a 1984 Reagan-esque landslide, with my one vote for Greenie the Tortoise playing the role of “Minnesota.”   After class I was inconsolable. Once the other kids left, Mrs. Kolphner came over and put her arm around me. She told me I had done a great job advocating for Greenie the Tortoise. Through tears I remember saying, “How good, exactly?” and she said “Very, very good,” and I said, “Good enough to —?” and she sighed and went to her desk to get one of the silver stars she gave out to kids who did a good job on something. And as I tearfully added it to my Silver Star Diary, she asked me what upset me the most. “Greenie was the better candidate,” I said. “Greenie should have won.” She nodded. “I suppose that was the point of the lesson,” I said.   “Oh no,” she said. “The point of the lesson is: People are unpredictable, and democracy is insane.”  Winston Churchill once said, “Democracy is the worst form of government, except all those other forms that have been tried.”  That is perhaps a pithier and better way to get my point across than that long anecdote about Mrs. Kolphner. Should I just erase all of that and start with this? Whatever. I’m pot-committed now, and is there extra caffeine in that hot chocolate? Because my head feels like a spaceship.  The point is: People making their own decisions is, on balance, better than an autocrat making decisions for them. It’s just that sometimes those decisions are bad, or self-defeating, or maddening, and a day where you get dressed up in your best victory pantsuit and spend an ungodly amount of money decorating your house with American flags and custom-made cardboard-cutouts of suffragettes in anticipation of a glass-ceiling-shattering historical milestone ends with you getting (metaphorically) eaten by a giant farting T. rex. Like most people, I deal with tragedy by processing the five stages of grief: Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, and Acceptance. My denial over the election results was intense. My anger was (in Ron’s words) “significant.” My bargaining was short, but creative — I offered my soul and the souls of all of my friends in exchange for 60,000 more votes in Milwaukee, to any demon who cared to accept. (Tom told me it was a terrible deal, but in that moment I didn’t care.) My depression I have already mentioned. Which brings us to acceptance. And here’s what I stand on that: No. I do not accept it. I acknowledge that Donald Trump is the president. I understand, intellectually, that he won the election. But I do not accept that our country has descended into the hatred-swirled slop pile that he lives in. I reject out of hand the notion that we have thrown up our hands and succumbed to racism, xenophobia, misogyny, and crypto-fascism. I do not accept that. I reject that. I fight that. Today, and tomorrow, and every day until the next election, I reject and fight that story.  I work hard and I form ideas and I meet and talk to other people who feel like me, and we sit down and drink hot chocolate (I have plenty) and we plan. We plan like mofos. We figure out how to fight back, and do good in this infuriating world that constantly wants to bend toward the bad. And we will be kind to each other, and supportive of each other’s ideas, and we will do literally anything but accept this as our fate.  And let me say something to the young girls who are reading this. Hi, girls. On behalf of the grown-ups of America who care about you and your futures, I am awfully sorry about how miserably we screwed this up. We elected a giant farting T. rex who does not like you, or care about you, or think about you, unless he is scanning your bodies with his creepy T. rex eyes, or trying to physically grab you like a toy his daddy got him (or would have, if his daddy had loved him). (Sorry, that was a low blow.) (Actually, not sorry, I’m pissed, and I’m on a roll, so zip it, super-ego!)  Our president-Elect is everything you should abhor and fear in a male role model. He has spent his life telling you, and girls and women like you, that your lives are valueless except as sexual objects. He has demeaned you, and belittled you, and put you in a little box to be looked at and not heard. It is your job, and the job of girls and women like you, to bust out. You are going to run this country, and this world, very soon. So you will not listen to this man, or the 75-year-old, doughy-faced, gray-haired nightmare men like him, when they try to tell you where to stand or how to behave or what you can and cannot do with your own bodies, or what you should or should not think with your own minds. You will not be cowed or discouraged by his stream of retrogressive babble. You won’t have time to be cowed, because you will be too busy working and learning and communing with other girls and women like you. And when the time comes, you will effortlessly flick away his miserable, petty, misogynistic worldview like a fly on your picnic potato salad. He is the present, sadly, but he is not the future. You are the future. Your strength is a million times his. Your power is a billion times his. We will acknowledge this result, but we will not accept it. We will overcome it, and we will defeat it.  Now find your team, and get to work.

However, their walls were still bare for they  hadn’t had the time for insulation yet. The first night they huddled  together in a single one of the huts around the largest fire they had  been able to make, trying to keep the cold draft away by spreading the  blankets over their backs and sitting as closely together as possible.  More than once Thorin was thankful that Dwalin’s body was an almost  living furnace as they sat huddled underneath Dwalin’s fur coat. They  spent many nights like that even when they had finished building their  temporary homes – although they were surrounded by mountains, the  closeness of their friends and kin was what truly held them together and  provided warmth beyond mere physical comfort. At least they were  surrounded by forest so there was little lack of wood for fires. Food, however, was another matter. They rationed everything they had  from the beginning, but even then, their resources still grew scarce  after a few months; the winter was harsher than anything they’d ever  been used to and no matter what they did, the food would not last until  spring. They would later hear that the snow that spring stayed for  unusually long, longer than in many years before. The forest provided  them with little; game was sparse on the mountain side and there were no  settlements close enough that they could have reached them whilst  surrounded by snow. “We’ll have to slaughter one of the ponies.” Thráin said quietly one  early afternoon as they sat around the fire, cradling Dís in his arms  who was weak from hunger and still had tracks of tears over her cheeks.  Winter time is the harshest time for the dwarves yet. " False link

Thorin nodded  and waited for him to go on - the announcement was hardly news for him  since he had expected no less, although everything concerning Azog and  Smaug had been kept carefully under wraps by all police departments  involved. “None of the information I recovered at Smaug’s has been able to  help.” Baggins added. He still looked slightly pale and there were  barely healed scratches on his face and arms from the explosion but  otherwise he still seemed remarkably in control, almost relieved even  that the charade was finally over. It was the look from his eyes that  gave Thorin the final clue. “You want me to interrogate him.” he said. It wasn’t even a question.  The big confrontation!
