Phil picks him up carrying him into the bedroom. “Blinds?” Dan mumbles between kisses. “Closed, too bright,” Phil murmurs back, laying Dan on the bed, finding Dan’s fingers, reaching over turning the lights off, his lips still attached to Dan’s. He carefully but quickly moves his hands up Dan’s arm pulling at the little black dress, Dan is confidently wearing for the party. “Off,” Phil detaches just long enough to get it over Dan’s head, before their lips are back together. “Fuck me,” Dan moans into the next sloppy kiss, easily getting Phil’s dress pants and boxers off. Phil unbuttons his shirt throwing it on the floor next to Dan’s dress, “We won’t need those,” Phil leans back in kissing down Dan’s neck attacking his collar bone leaving a mark on his right one. “Fuuuuck,” Dan moans out. Phil licks the area before swiftly moving his way down Dan’s body, biting at the panties, pulling off with his teeth. “Face fuck me,” Dan whines, “No time for,” Phil stops him slipping his tip in. Dan instantly begins licking and swirling. “Baby suck me,” Phil quickly flips them. Dan takes over with ease bobbing his head up and down, Phil grabs his hair, “keep brushing me like baby, feels so good. Make me go black.” Dan does as he’s told continuously bobbing and sucking, letting Phil thrust, as he knows his lips will be bruised for a day or two. Dan has his hands between his own legs getting himself off just as Phil, cums down his throat.

People were talking about him, about his new feat. See, Phil was quite popular. Really popular, actually. Didn’t listen to the teacher; had a new girlfriend every week; total heart throb. He was hot, to put it short. He was also single this week. Today he was walking alone. He usually walked with his “friends” but he didn’t. There was part of Phil that always longed for an actual friend, not just someone that was in it for the money (his family are rich and privileged af), but he’s never found that friend. Not yet, anyway. Dan on the other hand, was wheeling his way to his next class (you may be asking “Why wheeling?” well, Dan is… Different. Long story short, he moves in a wheelchair) while having abuse shouted at him. People shouting at him for being “weird”. He was the least popular kid in the whole school, an outcast. There was part of Dan that always longed for an actual friend, not just someone that was in it to give him pity, but he’s never found that friend. Not yet, anyway. Dan and Phil were in all the same classes, but they’d never spoke a word to each other. Dan always admired Phil from afar, like many other students. Walking past the students talking about how “cool” he was. Wheeling past students talking about how “weird” he was. Phil just wanted to be able to talk about how he actually felt. Dan just wanted to be able to talk about something other than how he actually felt. One of them was misunderstood by many, but was actually perfectly understood by the people who bothered to know them properly. The other was the complete opposite. Dan let a single tear slide down his cheek, hearing the things people were saying about him. Sometimes he wished people would physically hurt him instead of emotionally, it would be easier to spot just how damaged he really is. Then he heard someone say something that broke him. “If I looked like Dan I would kill myself.” He wheeled outside as fast as he could, breaking down into tears as soon as he got out there. Knowing that his face had already gone red and blotchy, he continued crying. “You ok?” He thought he heard someone ask. He told himself that no one would ask him that, that no one would care. “I said you ok?” He heard the guttural voice again. Now he realised it was real. He looked up. His heart felt like it stopped. There staring at him was a boy with jet black hair; ebony glasses; striking blue eyes; thin lips and porcelain pale skin, he had  No frickin’ way, he thought. Phil. Lester. “You just gonna look at me or answer?” Phil said with a slight laugh this time. “I… I’m ok.” Dan said with a stutter. Phil was now crouching next to Dan’s wheelchair so he could see eye to eye with him. “Care to tell me what happened?” Said Phil with a lilt in his voice. “Why are you acting like you care about me? You like me just as much as the others do, which is not much.” Dan asked while trying not to break down into tears again. Why would Phil pretend he cared, Dan thought to himself. Doesn’t he have better things to do than console a mangled freak, he asked himself. “I’m not acting. I do care.” He said to Dan, appalled that Dan thought for a second that he was faking. “You don’t. I’m just a mangled freak.” Dan replied, a tear escaping his eye and rolling down his cheek and he caught it with his tongue. It was salty. “You’re not. And I don’t care what you look like.” Phil said, holding Dan’s chin in his hand, so they can look each other in the eye. Those couple of words replayed in his head: I don’t care what you look like. Dan was looking into the distance past Phil thinking about what he had said, when Phil suddenly started leaning in. “Whoa Nelly! I am not your weekly girl!” Dan said, pushing Phil away. Dan started to wheel himself away. “Hey! I helped you! The least you could is give me your number!” Phil shouted at Dan. “Smooth, Lester. But not smooth enough.” Dan said and continued to wheel away. He couldn’t believe Phil would try that on him. End of chapter 1" True text

Dan was sitting in his room, scrolling through his feed on Instagram, not noticing most of the pictures. But then he stopped. The person he liked had posted a selfie, WITH HIS SHIRT OFF. He kept on telling himself “Just scroll past it, it’s just another picture.” but it wasn’t working. He wasn’t blinking, barely breathing; the photograph literally took his breath away. It wasn’t new to Dan that his crush was photogenic, but, damn he likes it. He heard his door slowly creek open, this snapped him out of his trance. Yazi, his twin sister (told you it wasn’t factual), was standing in the doorway, looking at Dan with wide eyes. Today she was wearing one of Dan’s jumpers that were way too big on him and jogging bottoms. She also had short “boy” hair so the only way you could tell her and Dan apart was their height. They were literally identical. “What the shizzle balls are you looking at?” Yazi said, running to Dan attempting to snatch his phone. Dan tried to fight her off but all she had to do was wheel his spinning chair backwards. Dan muttered a word under his breath. “Language.” Yazi warned. She clicked onto the profile that owned the stunning image. “Wow. Nice name, Phil. Like it. I can see why you like him.” She smiled, the phone illuminating her face. “I never said I liked him!” Dan shouted attempting to snatch his phone back. Yazi had a good 3 inches on Dan so all she had to do was hold the phone up in the air. “You’ve liked every post he has ever posted. Pretty sure you like him.” She replied without missing a beat. Dan felt a familiar heat return to his cheeks. “I… I don’t like him! I like girls! Now give my phone back.” Said a obviously lying teenage Dan. Yazi handed Dan’s phone to him, but she wasn’t going down without a fight. “So, tell me about him.” She said. Dan knew he had to give in sometime. He cracked. “Well… Ummm… He has blue eyes. These striking blue eyes. Like you’re looking into the sky on a warm summers day. His smile, well… Brightest one you will ever see. Black hair, a bit like mine but the opposite direction. He has lot’s of piercings and tattoo's all over him. But, he is the most polite person you will ever meet, I don’t think he’s ever swore, even when someone spilt water on his painting he had spent-” “You are in deeper than I thought. And gayer than I thought.” She rolled her eyes and gave Dan a smirk. He blushed redder than a tomato. Dan grabbed a pillow and buried his face into it. “I am, aren’t I?” He mumbled through the pillow. Dan looked up at his sister, she nodded at him solemnly while trying not to smile. Dan couldn’t believe he said he liked girls. He obviously didn’t. The next day at school… Dan’s face was bright red. He was walking next to Phil Lester, the Phil Lester. And then, just Dan’s luck, someone sticks their foot out and trips him up. “You ok Winnie the Pooh?” He heard one of the other kids mock. He could feel a single tear roll down his cheek. He saw a shadow fall over him. “You ok?” The person whispered. They said it gutturally. The sound of the voice pleased Dan… in many ways. He looked up at who said it. Sugar, Dan thought as he saw who it was. The person placed their hand on Dan’s chin, and that’s when he tuned out. Phil held Dan’s limp body in his arms, walking casually to the nurse as if he wasn’t carrying the most bullied and least popular kid In his arms. He got weird looks from people, sniggers from some. He just gave them the death stare. Dan woke up lying on a sofa with his head on someone’s lap. His heartbeat quickened its pace. How had he been so lucky to fall over? " True text

I rolled over to look at his ocean - blue eyes. My bare legs wrapped around his and I buried my face into his neck, kissing it seductively. The sun was drawing in through the thin, green and blue curtains; the birds sang welcomly in the trees next to the communal garage outside the apartments. “You were amazing last night Dan,” Phil said in awe, his eyes meeting mine. His voice drained in my mind as I thought back to our sex. His pale body against mine, the loud moans we let out as I rode his enormous dick. His gentle lips kissing mine. “They don’t call you Amazing Phil for nothing,” I replied, giving a wink. Both of us let out a little giggle. Glancing over at the alarm clock, I rubbed the yellow stuff from my eyes (that I’d never knew the name of) and gasped. Phil leaned over me to look too and realised the time. “It’s ten, I’m late for work!” I said, my voice anxiously shaking. Suddenly, Phil got out his dick and shoved it in my mouth, making me gag into the sheets. “You’re sick, you can’t go in today.” Phil replied, smiling cheekily. For some reason I didn’t find it grotesque like I’d imagined and it just turned me on. I quickly climbed onto Phil, sucking his cock, licking his shaft and rubbing my hands up and down. I crouched above and slid his hard dick into my ass. “P, P… PHIL!” I screamed, as I rubbed my ass against his shaft. I leant over, kissing his neck while bouncing on his dick. He playfully tickled my nipples, making me moan pleasurably. “Dan, I think I’m about to –“Phil’s sentence was cut off as a warm flow of semen bursted up my ass and all over his stomach. I climbed off and licked it like an obeying dog. This was much better than work. Phil got up and got in the shower, while I phoned up work. I was a workaholic, so it didn’t affect them much. I got changed, and so did Phil after his shower. “Time to record more vids,” Phil groaned, “I’d rather take you on a nice day out. I slid onto his lap on his computer chair, kissing his neck. “I wouldn’t mind that,” I replied. We put on our shoes and coats and walked out into the early afternoon.  The sun had hidden itself behind the clouds like a normal British day. Hand in hand, we began to walk to the local park. You could see the large, concrete fountain in the distance, spitting out months old water. That’s where me and Phil had our first kiss, and then back to the apartment to fuck of course. A group of dodgy teens had appeared behind us, giggling amongst themselves. I turned round to find them pointing at our colliding hands. I let go so I could see them in full view. In hope of my “get the fuck out of here before I WHOOP ye ass” face scaring them, I pulled the face and tapped my foot against the stone pavement in disapproval but they stayed and threw a punch at my face. Phil turned round and cupped my bleeding nose with his hands: reaching for a crumpled tissue in his pocket. He frowned but they trampled on our feet and ran off. One hand on my nose and one hand on his phone, Phil dialled 999 in hope of the police to catch them. We then left the park and strolled into the city, the police had taken care of everything. We walked into starbucks and grabbed hot chocolates, a storm was brewing outside. I and Phil took the seats in the corner. As we sipped our hot drinks, Phil leaned in and caressed my cheek. “I’m so lucky to have you,” he whispered – loud enough to hear through the chats of the public surrounding us but quiet enough for only me to hear. And with that, he stood up and knelt down on one knee. Brining out a soft, velvet red box from his coat pocket, he held a beautiful silver ring out for me and placed it on my finger. “I wouldn’t swap you for anyone else,” I replied and reached in for a passionate kiss. The whole coffee shop raved and cheered at our engagement. After a round of free hot chocolates, we called a taxi home and fucked back at our apartment. I was the luckiest man alive." True text
phanfic 159191101247 "2017-04-04 14:56:54 GMT" http://phanfic.tumblr.com/post/159191101247 "Susan wandered around the pitch black house at three in the morning, in search for her father; Dan. “Daddy?” She asked as she found him on the couch with his laptop on his lap and the reflective white light making his face visible. His eyes darted to the little girl in the hallway. “Darling, what are you doing up?” He asked nervously, getting up and closing is laptop.  “I couldn’t sleep.” She murmured rubbing her small brown eyes. Dan smiled and picked her up and she rested her head on his shoulder.  “I’m sorry Princess. How about we bake a cake to surprise daddy?” Susan’s eyes lit up and she looked at Dan and nodded. Dan giggled and carried her to to the kitchen, and let her sit on the counter. He flipped on the lights and gently tapped her nose. “Okay, so first thing we need is the dry ingredients.” Dan started pulling stuff out of the cabinets and setting them down next to his daughter. He looked at her and hugged her. “We have to be very quiet so we don’t wake up daddy, okay?”  “Okay!” Susan said happily.  As they started baking, they didn’t realise how loud they were getting. Phil in the room down the hall woke up and slipped on his glasses and slowly got out of bed. He walked in to the kitchen just as Dan and Susan were putting the cake in the oven. “Bear, Babygirl? What are you doing awake?” He asked rubbing his eyes under his glasses. Dan helped Susan down and she ran at Phil.  “Daddy!!!” She yelped jumping at him. Phil smiled and caught her and hugged her tight. “Hey, Babygirl.” Dan giggled and kissed his husband.  “Goodmorning, Baby.” He whispered in his ear. Phil’s face turned red and he smiled.  “Goodmorning, Bear. Are you going to tell me what you and our princess were doing at three in the morning?” Dan looked at his daughter and she laughed and shook her head.  “Nope. Go back to sleep, baby.” He cooed as phil put Susan down.  “Well, I’m not going to sleep now, so why don’t we watch a movie?” Susan’s eyes lit up and she nodded. Dan smiled and sighed. “Fine, Susan go with daddy and pick out a movie I’ll get something for us to eat.” The timer on the oven beeped and Dan pulled the cake out and let it cool. He got white icing and blue and green food colouring. He started mixing the colours together and created blue and green marble frosting. He put it on the frosting and took the heart shaped pan and some plates into the living room. He set down the cake and looked at them. “Don’t touch anything yet.” Dan warned looking at Phil. He left the room and came back with pop corn and glasses of lactose free milk. Phil looked up at him and then to Susan. “You baked a cake?” He asked, looking mostly at Susan. Dan smiled and held her on his lap. Their daughter giggled and smiled. “Yup! I hope you like it, Daddy!!” Susan said quietly, Phil took a fork and cut a small piece out and put it on a plate and took a bite.  “Wow, Susan! You and Daddy did really well.” They sat like that, watching movies and eating cake like a small happy family." True text
phanfic 159123786372 "2017-04-02 20:22:17 GMT" http://phanfic.tumblr.com/post/159123786372 "“Phil? PHIL?” Dan calls louder when there is no response. He knows Phil is home. His keys are in their usual place. Or… “Did he forget his keys again?” he sighs. On his way to his room he trips on something on the floor. Clothes. Phil’s clothes. “How does he manage to leave clothes in the hallway?” he grunts pushes the piece of cloth aside at the same time he is distracted by something: a festival of open cabinets in the kitchen. “How hard is it to close this damn things!!!” he slams the cabinets closed, the loud sound echoing in the empty house. His irritation is growing exponentially. Every little thing out of place making him crankier. Normally a few open cabinets wouldn’t bother him too much, except that one time he was still sleepy and almost broke his nose walking straight into one. But this particular day everything can upset him. An early call with his parents and the following argument about him moving out sent his mood to the gutter. Apparently he is a child going to live with and older but more immature child and they give them two weeks to go back on their decision on moving together to an apartment in Manchester. He doesn’t waste his time trying to explain to them he has spent more time with Phil than with them in the past months and they work out fine. He doesn’t even consider telling them how terribly lonely and out of place he feels in his own home and that with Phil… well with Phil it’s different. He feels more at home in the young man’s bare apartment than in any other place. He ignores the comments that follow. Especially the recurrent ‘You can’t just stalk someone online and go live with them. That’s not normal.’ Okay then, he’s not normal  Dan expected to find Phil home when he returned from his angry aimless walk around the town. He hasn’t seen Phil since morning nor as the man told him where he would be going so early. They had decided to go buy some furniture and now he is missing. He checks his watch. 20 minutes past the time they set to go out. “Oh, screw this…” he says and kicks a chair before sitting on it. ‘So much for not feeling lonely.’ He thinks to himself and hates the world just a little bit more when he starts considering if what his parents said might be even partially true. “Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck.” He is in full tantrum mode. Stomping his foot and everything. “This might not work out…” he whispers to himself, not daring to say it louder, and the acknowledgement of that fact gets him so much more depressed. He runs his hand down his face and tries to think of anything going right in his life. The relationship with his parents? Laughable. College? The pain of his existence, the source of most of his breakdowns. Youtube? Yeah, that is probably what makes him happier. And what did Youtube bring him? Phil. A best friend after 18 years of feeling alone and out of place. But now… What if moving in was a mistake? What if after two weeks they are tired of arguing over open cabinets and can’t stand each other? What if each one just does their separate lives and the most interaction they have is a text message late at night saying they have to leave the house early the next morning and possibly bail on going furniture-buying? What if his clinginess pushed Phil into their current situation and he will get tired of him soon? His imaginative mind could go on for hours, coming up with all the things that could go wrong in the near future in his life. That seems to be the thing he does best. But his thoughts are interrupted by a muffled sound. From inside the house. He stays alert and hears the sound again. He immediately recognizes it. Even if muffled and distant. When he hears it again he figures where its coming from: the less empty room of the house. When he enters it, being as quiet as possible, the familiar lion plushy stares at him from the nightstand. It’s owner is nowhere to be seen but Dan knows he heard him. Like on cue he hears a sound again, coming from the wardrobe. He rolls his eyes and silently walks to it. His instinct and his current mood push him to feel all the more angry for having his time wasted. But another part of him tells him that’s Phil being Phill, and he wouldn’t have it any other way. Another sound, this time not even that muffled. Phil is laughing inside the wardrobe, probably thinking he is being super discreet. Dan sighs and finally opens the door. “Surprise!” Phil yells as the numerous balloons that he had trapped with himself in the closet fly away. Now the blue eyes man is laughing uncontrollably and Dan can help but laughing too. “And what is this?” he asks. “You’re ‘Welcome to Manchester’ surprise of course.” Phil says like it’s the most obvious thing in the world. “And you’re late. Help me out.” He stretches his arms out and waits for Dan to help him out from his cross legged position in the wardrobe. “Do you know how hard it is to stay in that position? Especially when you’re this tall? Well, on the Brightside I now have good training to withstand a flight in a tiny airplane sit.” Dan stares at the man trying to catch the helium filled ballons from the ceiling for a good minute. The scowl on his face is now fully replaced with a smile. “So the ‘going out to by furniture’ thing was a lie?” he asks. “No. We really need to get you a wardrobe. Bigger than this one, preferably. But I timed it perfectly so I would have time to hide and when you woke up and saw I wasn’t home you would come to take revenge on my wardrobe and you would find me here and voila!” Phil says, fully proud of his extremely flawed logic. Dan laughs. He feels light and happy and he just wants to laugh. The way Phil’s brain works still amazes him. “I’m just glad you didn’t find the cake in the refrigerator.” “There’s cake?” “Of course. All surprise parties need cake.” Phil chirps and guides Dan back to the kitchen. He takes the cake out of the fridge and grabs to forks. “No plates?” Dan asks. “Do you wanna have to wash them after?” Phil says but doesn’t wait for Dan’s response and gets a fork full of cake in his mouth. Dan smiles and does the same. “Cake for breakfast. This is the life!” Dan stares at the perfectly happy 23 year-old in amazement. Phil is oblivious to the unpleasant phone call from that morning, the doubts that assaulted Dan and the life crisis he was about to have. And he will remain like that because any foul mood and worries that Dan felt before are completely dissipated. Phil’s presence has that effect on him. He can’t quite explain it. A few years later, when that magical effect Phil has on him still lasts, he will say that for him, personally, Phil’s personality is the best in the world. And that’s the best he can explain it, even if it lacks so much of how it really makes him feel. “I was thinking we could go to IKEA and then try to build a wardrobe ourselves. I mean, it’s cheaper. And how hard can it be?” Phil muses. “With our combined skill I think we’ll be able to at least get a nice looking pile of wood as a result. Let’s make a video out of it.” Dan agrees and gets up. “Wait. Just five more pieces of cake.” Phil begs with puppy eyes he doesn’t even realize he is doing. Dan immediately sits back down. “You’re such an idiot.” He says, the biggest smile plastered on his face and his heart full of hope in an exciting future and certainty that he will never feel lonely again."

He slightly curled his lower legs up to his torso, probably felt the sudden breeze that just blew in. I took the corner of the duvet, pulled it up to cover more of his bare chest. Almost responding to the touch, Dan knitted his brows, gradually extended his legs to the new warmth from the enclosed space; then as if nothing happened, he slowly relaxed his face, and felt deep into sleep again. I looked at the soft duvet that naturally shape to the curve of Dan’s body, gently placed my hand on his small waist, and then caressed down to his hip. Dan had a broad shoulder, but his waist was actually quite slim if he didn’t overindulge sweets that month. Although I’d always tell him I simultaneously love his stomach fat and his collar bone as I don’t care if he was thin or chubby, he called me stupid saying it was a cliché contradiction and I must have preferred one to the other. However, my Dan didn’t realize that I couldn’t care less about his weight, when looking at him was already a luxury. It’s like when you have a stack of the most delicious, freshly made bacon pancake with warm maple syrup in front of you, all the other food would be so insignificant. To me, Dan was like that, having the ability to make everything else so painfully insignificant. Dan turned over, slowly opened his eyes, revealing a pair of glistening brown irises that is still full of tiredness. Slowly, he stretched out his hand to rub the sleep out, while pulling the duvet that was sort of clumped together up to his neck. I looked at him sitting up, eyes were drawn to the different shades of light reflecting on his skin as he turned to the opposite side. The pale moon light hit on his soft body, highlighted his neck and the sides of his back, leaving a dark line that accentuated his spine down to his hip. Dan flinched to the touch of my hand on his back- the involuntary action that I half regretted. It was almost too instinctive to touch something so breathtaking to feel regret afterward. “No, please.” He spoke. I wanted to think that his tone derived from sadness, but it was more from disappointment. I shook my head, but didn’t withdraw my hand like Dan wanted. Instead, I pulled myself closer, threw my arms around his torso that had turned colder from the night breeze, and enclosed him in my chest despite his usual protest. I know he was lying. He’d always lied, a little bit too much actually. He lied to everyone how he and I don’t sleep on the same bed; he lied to his mom how much he loves his current girlfriend; he lied to his friends that he has never kissed a guy; and he lied to the world that he is as straight as a stick. I gently lifted up Dan’s head that was buried between his knees and pulled him into a deep kiss, more passionate after every minute. I snatched the duvet that was placed between our naked bodies, revealing a vulnerable Dan who was still resisting to my touch. Dan was always like this. He would tell me to limit physical interaction with him, when his body told the opposite. He would tell me to not hold his hands in public, when eventually he became so lost that he secretly took my hand and never let it go. He would tell me to not kiss him, when he blushed so much and deepened the kiss until we ran out of breathe. He would tell me to not look at him too long, to not touch him too dearly, to not love him too passionately, but when I held him down and placed kisses all over his body while entering him from behind with those lazy deep thrusts, he moaned loudly and wanted more. Dan lied down on his front, shivering to each of the peck I placed on the back of his neck. My hands were all over his body, touching the places that no one else would be allowed to. His eyes tightened, breathing became uneven, hands curled into fist. I turned him over, looked deep into the dark irises that were now drown in lust. I couldn’t imagine how much he was hating himself at that moment. “Baby, I love you. So much.” I whispered against his skin, finally stopped touching him to align his back against my chest, then slowly drew deformed circles along his arm. “I don’t love you.” He said, while looking aimlessly into the dark night, probably felt half despise and half guilty. “I know, you hate me.” Of course, he hated me. I said it before he could. I lost counts how many times he had said so after those passionate and endless make out sections we exchanged. He wasn’t shy to express how much he despised the idea of us being together, but he would consent to every despicable things I do; he would yearn for my constant presence when we were outside, would crave for my comfort when he tried to escape from the world’s cruelty, and would thirst for my touch during those sleepless long night. “We don’t love each other, Phil.” Dan said, eyes still fixated on some imagery outside the window. It was like his reflect, to say No to whatever I have to offer, to deny the slightest romantic connection between us, to annihilate every single evidence that we could be together as more than friends. I listened to those so many times, as it they were like chants imprinted somewhere on his eyelid, that whenever he saw me, he would be required to say them out loud. It’s hurt, of course, very much so often that my heart would be full of calluses. After 3 years living together, I stopped believing in his meaningless and pretentious defense. Those words would always hurt however, but I just stopped dwelling on the pain. For all I know, love could turn pain into kisses. It happened in December, sometime around midnight, when we were at the BBC end of year party. We were both quite drunk, but for different reasons. Dan was upset with his girlfriend, Eva, a controlling freak who called him 10 times over a span of 15 minutes when he was talking to our co-workers. And I was upset with Dan, witnessing him chose to get stuck on an inevitable, dead-end and unhealthy relationship like a moth drawn to flame. He was on the verge of turning insane, being exhausted with Eva’s unsympathetic acts but would refused to leave her. She could have tortured him, degraded him, turned him into an absolute worthless mess and he would do nothing but drove to her house at 3am just because she suddenly wanted to watch the new episode of Scream Queen. Dan rationalized all of her irrational actions, and told me that it was love. He didn’t care if she would turn into a jealous, selfish, hysterical bitch, he would still be there, because he loved her. But just like every other things, those saccharine sweet nothings were all buried thousand miles deep after 30 vulgar texts, a screaming call, and too many margaritas with extra shots of tequila. “Screw it. Not tonight, I will talk to her tomorrow.” Dan dropped his body on our sofa, not even bothered to take off his shoes. He threw his phone across the room, then looked at me all pouting and exhausted. “Well, isn’t she the love of your life?” I cringed, hoping Dan wouldn’t be too upset with the sarcastic tone. To my surprise, he looked at me indifferently, then directed his gaze to the bottle of red wine on our counter top. Seeing him having no intention to move, I lifted Dan’s legs up to untie his black Yeezy. “Ugh…I feel sick. But not sick enough to sleep.” Dan spoke as he stretched his feet, rubbed the fabrics of my jacket between his toes. He pointed at the wine bottle and looked at me again all smiling. “Phillll, please?” “No. Are you crazy? We drank a lot today.” I scolded him softly. I knew Dan wasn’t a lightweight, but I was sure he couldn’t handle any more alcohol without feeling extremely sick and regretful tomorrow morning. I crawled next to him on the sofa, fixed his damped fringe that stuck messily on his forehead. “Phil, why am I not good enough for her?” Dan gave up on the wine, leaned his head on my shoulder and rubbed his face against my neck. “Why doesn’t she trust me?” “I don’t know Dan. What do you want to hear? I told you a million times that she is the one who is not good enough for you. In fact, I don’t understand her at all. To me you are the most precious thing in this world, and I love you so much the only thing left to do would be to kill you and keep you in a glass tank so you wouldn’t be defiled and I get to have you for myself.” And just like that. One could say that it was out of pity, for him to reckon my hopeless and pathetic love. Or it was just one of the effects of alcohol. Or maybe, Dan was conveniently feeling lonely that night. Dan looked at me with his chocolate eyes, leaned in close, and placed a soft kiss on my lips. I grabbed his hand making him startled, pushed him on the couch, and hungrily kissed him back. It was indescribable. His small waist in my hand, his wet lips on my mouth, his most private and precious part on my fingertip. I made sure to not leave any part of Dan’s body untouched. His pretty eyes with dark lashes, his curly brown hair, his pink hardened nipples, his soft butt cheeks, his long legs, his lovely toes. Everywhere on his body was traced with my kisses, some clearer than the others. Dan’s lips, shoulder blades, collar bones, upper arms, nipples, inner thighs were filled with red, deep marks as the skin turned red and raw from continuous kissing. When he started to moan and verbally begged for more, I inserted my lubbed index finger inside him. Dan jerked up, making the finger slip in deeper. I crooked my finger upward and found the soft spot that caused Dan to squirm and panted and moaned. Dan looked like the subject of everyone’s deep dark sexual fantasy, with his legs open wide while glistening precum dripping down his left thigh and bed sheet. When he started to relax, I aligned my penis in front of him, feeling it being swallowed whole. He extended his arms and wrapped it around my neck, asking me to kiss him. I pecked on his lips, but then could not stop. The thrusts and kisses were in sync. The faster and deeper I thrust inside Dan, the more passionate the kiss. I looked at Dan, the boy was so drowned in pleasure that he just let his open lips rubbing against mine, letting the saliva dripping down the corner of his mouth. When we both came, Dan finally opened his eyes. One drop of tear started rolling down his blushed cheek and disappeared under the pillow. He shut his eyes tight again, and felt into deep sleep."

Seeing as we are getting new followers each and every day, we thought it would be a good idea to remind everyone about prompts.We take prompts here; little ideas that fill your brilliant minds but for some reason, you decide it would be better if someone else wrote it. We think it’s wonderful we have so many because that means that there is an endless amount of creativity being shared from readers to writers. However, as we get more and more followers, more and more prompts come in and we end up deleting some which make people sad.The only reasons we would delete prompts are as follows;1. They contain slurs/derogatory terms: I really don’t want to have to explain this one, but surprisingly enough, we will receive prompts that contain slurs/derogatory terms and we refuse to publish them. If you’re not sure whether or not a word is a slur (it probably is if you have to think about it), just send us an ask off anon so that we can help you word it appropriately.2. They are too vague: saying you want some phan angst just isn’t enough…neither is phan angst where they fight. A proper prompt would say something like ‘Phan angst where Dan and Phil are getting annoyed at each other’s little quirks (Dan dropping papers behind tables, Phil leaving cabinets open, etc.) but they keep letting the little things slide. However, one of them reaches a tipping point and starts listing off all the things the other does wrong. They fight and say things they don’t mean, but after some time, decide to apologize and make up.’ You want to be a little bit specific so that the authors have something to go off of. Help them out and they are more likely to publish the fic you want to read!3. They are repeats: I know you’re eager to see your prompt be published, but please be patient! While all the admins work hard to keep the ask box under control, we still have work, school, family obligations, social lives, etc. that we need to tend to. Please keep in mind that we are people too and we get busy just like you so it might take some time before you see your prompt published.4. They are obvious crack!fics: we love joking around as much as the next person, but when we have an ask box full of well-intentioned prompts, it’s not fair to the people waiting to have to read “lolzor, dan n fil shove a whole fukin cake tin up their bums 4 sexii times~”. It takes time for us to read them when we could have spent that time reading and tagging another ask or prompt. Again, we have lots of stuff outside phanfic and when we have to waste time with silly prompts like that, prompts that many people would like to see published end up getting buried." True text

So the admins at the @phanfictioncatalogue and now at the new @Pfclibrary have been thinking for a long time that we wanted to make our author page more interactive and useful to the larger phandom audience.  Rather than going onto our authors page, and just seeing a thousand names, but knowing nothing about those authors whose names you’re staring at, we wanted to make the authors page a useful tool for finding authors who write the things that you are interested in! So, the admins from both blogs have come up with a plan!  We want to compile a more comprehensive authors list, with details such as these, included: Author Name Fic Location/Site Content They Write Oneshots, Chaptered, Both? Word Count Varient Known for/Popular Fic Status Link to Masterlist(s) As we already have such a huge list of authors in the library, we’ve moved them all to google sheets so that we can find out the new information on them and properly add them to the library! But we need your help! If you could please spread this post around with the link below, we would love to have authors add themselves and fill in the information for other authors for us, so that we can add them to the official authors page! There is a form for each two letters of the alphabet, and an example at the top of every form on how to fill in the information needed! The form, however, will be restricted to comment only, with the admins having to add the information themselves, to prevent anyone from messing with the information already gathered here, or accidentally deleted the entire post!  Fill Out The Phandom Author Form HereA-B, C-D, E-F, G-H, I-J, K-L, M-N, O-P, Q-R, S-T, U-V, W-X, Y-Z  " False text

Please read the following information and instructions before you claim anything. Claims made incorrectly will be deleted.You don’t need a Google account to comment. However, you must be already signed up as a beta for PBB5 to claim.You must tell us who you are. For example, to claim a fic, I would write, “philslesters, 1st claim”You must indicate what number claim this is. We are keeping track of every claim made. To claim my first fic, I would write, “philslesters, 1st claim”. To claim a second, I would write, “philslesters, 2nd claim”.Similarly, you can only claim the amount of fics you signed up for. If you have signed up to beta one fic, you can only claim one fic. If you have signed up for two, you can claim two and no more.You must reply to the relevant summary. Right click on the box with the bold red number and select the “insert comment” option from the drop down list. Type in your claim and hit “comment” to submit.Primary claims take priority over any secondary claims. Anyone making their first claim can overwrite the claims of anyone on their 2nd+ claim. For example, if I were to comment on a summary with “philslesters claim 2” and Michelle commented on it saying “thatsmistertoyou claim 1”, then Michelle would get the fic. However, if I were to comment on something saying “philslesters claim 2” and Michelle commented on it saying “thatsmistertoyou claim 2”,  then whoever commented first gets it. This rule applies with any number of claim. Secondary claims are first come, first serve. If you don’t get the number of fics you signed up for, too bad.During the first wave, which will last 24 hours, only primary claims can be made. After those 24 hours are over you are allowed to claim a second fic. We will make a post announcing when the second wave will start. Secondary claims during the first wave will be deleted by us. This year claiming will be held on Google Forms. There are six sheets categorized by the estimated word count for each summary. Feel free to sort through as many of the sheets as you like and claim whichever summary strikes your fancy! 5k-7k Claiming Sheet7k-10k Claiming Sheet10k-15k Claiming Sheet15k-20k Claiming Sheet20k-30k Claiming Sheet30k+ Claiming SheetPublic spreadsheet to confirm claims!(Your claim will not appear here straight away.
