While many choose their own name or a funny message, PewDiePie jokingly asked the pair to display: “DEATH TO ALL JEWS”. He published the resulting clip, showing them dancing and laughing while holding the antisemitic message above their heads, on his YouTube channel. While some fans found the clip funny, others said the star had gone too far. Despite requesting the hateful message to be displayed, and publishing the resulting video, PewDiePie apologised to fans at the end of the video – but still gave the performers a five-star rating. He said: “I am sorry. I didn’t think they would actually do it. I feel partially responsible. I mean I’ve got to give them five stars for an outstanding experience because at least they did what I asked.” He added: “I don’t feel good. I don’t feel too proud of this, I’m not gonna lie. I’m not antisemitic, or whatever it’s called, okay so don’t get the wrong idea. It was a funny meme, and I didn’t think it would work, okay. I swear I love jews, I love ‘em. “I am so sorry. I don’t know what else to say.”  pewdiepie paid some guys actual money to hold up a sign that said “DEATH TO ALL JEWS”, published it, gave them a 5-star rating, and then tried to shrug off any responsibility by saying he didn’t think they would really do it. he even says he only feels “partially” responsible and he’s “not antisemitic” despite the fact that he 1) posted this video so close to a surge in antisemitic hate crimes following trump’s election and 2) posted this video at all. this isn’t funny, this isn’t satire, it’s gross and hateful shock humor at the expense of people who are already unsafe with the increasingly emboldened neo nazis–i mean, “alt right”. it’s not defensible. stop supporting him.  That racist, disgusting, vomit inducing Antisemitic roach.  these are the two performers in question. they had an innocent business going on where they would dance in the jungle with a sign saying anything, pewdiepie exploited them by forcing them to brandish his antisemitic message, and they were banned from Fiverr (obviously a source of income for them) while pewdiepie excused himself from blame and received none. in the same video pewdiepie  paid a freelance performer to drink bleach and proceeded to smugly laugh about it said hiring graphic designers is useless and instructed the viewers to steal art from deviant art instead made fun of the entire demographic of people advertising on Fiverr (calling them people who will do “whatever i want” for $5) and took it as an excuse to exploit them, saying “they are more than happy that i am supporting their business.” and in the same grossly entitled breath, he took these two disprivileged men’s business away. called “death to jews” a “funny meme” this man and anyone who finds him funny is fucking disgusting and irrelevant.   Pewdiepie, bona fide scumbag  @the-brothers-drake  Antisemitic fucking asshole, I dont want to see him on my dash in a positive light at all. Hes a privileged racist little shitstain.  What a piece of shit. And of course @youtube won’t shut down his account for this. Your daily reminder that white men are the devil.  " False link
