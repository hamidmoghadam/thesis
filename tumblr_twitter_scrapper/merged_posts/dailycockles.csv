Thanks to some fans with some awesome cameras, I am almost postive they were right.  ▪️ Here’s Jensen wearing the bracelet at the Jailbreak concert. (source:    x )   You can see the bracelet is embossed with letters or markings but I have no clue what those markings are doing in the first pic but in the second pic, it looks like a p or maybe a d.   ▪️ Then there was Misha at JIBLAND seen with a bracelet that looked an awful lot like Jensen’s from the day before. Thankfully unlike Jensen, you can clearly make out what his says. I’m gonna be an asshole and helpfully circle the obvious for you guys. (source: x , x ) Keep reading " False text

Are they wearing American fish flag hats?! Why? Who does that? Were they together when they bought them? A gift?  What does it even mean?   Gdi but there are just too many fish puns and references out there. I mean c’mon, even their ship name, cockles, is somehow related to fish. And then there’s the boat trip. And Moby Dick hanging out in Jensen’s pants. And take a look at Spn. Fish and fishing has become a big enough presence in the show to inspire some really clever meta. (seriously find the fish meta; read the fish meta; send me the fish meta because I can’t remember where I found it). Or maybe it’s political because Trump as president really is a fish out of water. Who the shit knows? It is just so random and weird but couply. What are they thinking? Why are they like this with their stupid inscrutable inside jokes?! I just don’t know and I want to die.  " False text

(The video should be in mp4 or wmv and in a good quality!) Why am I doing this?  First of all, I’m not doing this for Misha or anybody else to notice, I’m doing this because I’m supporting this idea. I have a lot of vidder friends that struggle with depression and other things and I came to the point at which I realized that I can’t help them as much as I would like to. Some get professional help now, but there are still a lot of people that don’t want to go and see a therapist. I want to help those people and that’s why I volunteered a few days ago to the #YouAreNotAlone campaign. Now, I really want to reach more people with that, telling them that there are people they can talk to and I want more people, that aren’t necessarily in the Supernatural fandom to join this campaign.  What happens with the footage I’ll get?  I’ll use it in my video and upload it as soon as I’ll finish the video, but that’s it! I won’t post the pictures anywhere else, I’ll immediately delete the footage. But you have to be aware that I’ll upload the video on a public website. I’ll credit everyone in the desctiption box and if I forget someone, feel free to message me and I’ll fix it as soon as possible. If you want to stay anonymous, please tell me! How can you send me the footage?  Here are all the social medias you can reach me on: tumblr: http://mariestrikeout.tumblr.com/Twitter: https://twitter.com/knuddelwuddelllAsk.fm: https://ask.fm/MStrikeOutYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTj8PwZT7P9BgAS1J_4pU7we-mail: strikeout@outlook.de You can upload the footage on sendspace or mediafire. I won’t set a deadline yet, since I have no idea how fast this will spread, but send it to me as soon as possible! Can you help me in another way?  I am pretty new on tumblr, that’s why I only have a few followers. I’d appreciate a reblog or any other form of sharing.  If you have any ideas how I can make this thing even bigger, please don’t be shy to message me! You have some ideas for the project? I’d like to head them! :)   Thank you for reading this!  " False text
