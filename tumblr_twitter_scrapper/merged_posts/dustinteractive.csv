Because the most important thing about art is to work. Nothing else matters except sitting down every day and trying.Why is this so important?Because when we sit down day after day and keep grinding, something mysterious starts to happen. A process is set into motion by which, inevitably and infallibly, heaven comes to our aid. Unseen forces enlist in our cause; serendipity reinforces our purposes.This is the other secret that real artists know and wannabe writers don’t. When we sit down each day and do our work, power concentrates around us. The Muse takes note of our dedication. She approves. We have earned favor in her sight. When we sit down and work, we become like a magnetized rod that attracts iron filings. Ideas come. Insights accrete.Just as Resistance has its seat in hell, so Creation has it’s home in heaven. And it’s not just a witness, but an eager and active ally.What I call Professionalism someone else might call the Artist’s Code or the Warrior’s Way. It’s an attitude of egolessness and service. The Knights of the Round Table were chaste and self-effacing. Yet they dueled dragons.We’re facing dragons too. Fire-beathing griffins of the soul, whom we must outfight and outwit to reach the treasure of our self-in-potential and to release the maiden who is God’s plan and destiny for ourselves and the answer to why we were put on this planet.Invoking The MuseThe quote from Xenophon that opens this section comes from a pamphlet called The Cavalry Commander, in which the celebrated warrior and historian proffers instruction to those young gentlemen who aspired to be officers of the Athenian equestrian corps. He declares that the commander’s first duty, before he mucks out a stable or seeks funding from the Defense Review Board, is to sacrifice to the gods and invoke their aid.I do the same thing. The last thing I do before I sit down to work is say my prayer to the Muse. I say it out loud, in absolute ernest. Only then do I get down to business.In my late twenties I rented a little house in Northern California; I had gone there to finish a novel or kill myself trying. By that time I had blown up a marriage to a girl I loved with all my heart, screwed up two careers, blah blah, etc., all because (though I had no understanding of this at the time) I could not handle Resistance. I had one novel nine-thenths of the way through and another at ninety-nine hundreths before I threw them in the trash. I couldn’t finish ‘em. I didn’t have the guts. In yielding thusly to Resistance, I fell prey to every vice, evil, distraction, you-name-it mentioned heretofore, all leading nowhere, and finally washed up in this sleepy California town, with my Chevy van, my cat Mo, and my antique Smith-Corona.A guy named Paul Rink lived down the street. Look him up, he’s in Henry Miller’s Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch. Paul was a writer. He lived in his camper, “Moby Dick.” I started each day over coffee with Paul. He turned me on to all kinds of authors I had never heard of, lectured me on self-discipline, dedication, the evils of the marketplace. But best of all, he shared with me his prayer, the Invocation of the Muse from Homer’s Odyssey, the T.E. Lawrence translation. Paul typed it out for me on his even-more-ancient-than-mine manual Remington. I still have it. It’s yellow and parched as dust; the merest puff would blow it to powder.In my little house I had no TV. I never read a newspaper or went to a movie. I just worked. One afternoon I was banging away in the little bedroom I had converted to an office, when I heard my neighbor’s radio playing outside. Someone in a loud voice was declaiming “…to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.” I came out. What’s going on? “Didn’t you hear? Nixon’s out; they got a new guy in there.”I had missed Watergate completely.I was determined to keep working. I had failed so many times, and caused myself and people I loved so much pain thereby, that I felt if I crapped out this time, I would have to hang myself. I didn’t know what Resistance was then. No one had schooled me in the concept. I felt it though, big-time. I experienced it as a compulsion to self-destrcut. I could not finish what I started. The closer I got, the more different ways I’d find to screw it up. I worked for twenty-six months straight, taking only two out for a stint of migrant labor in Washington State, and finally one day I got to the last page and typed out:THE END.I never did find a buyer for the book. Or the next one, either. IT was ten years before I got the first check for something I had written and ten more before a novel, The Legend of Bagger Vance, was actually published. But that moment when I first hit the keys to spell out THE END was epochal. I remember rolling the last page out and adding it to the stack that was the finished manuscript. Nobody knew I was done. Nobody cared. But I knew. I felt like a dragon I’d been fighting all my life had just dropped dead at my feet and gasped out it’s last sulfuric breath.Rest in peace, motherfucker.Next morning I went over to Paul’s for coffee and told him I had finished. “Good for you,” he said without looking up. “Start the next one today.”" True text
dustinteractive 106580303691 "2014-12-30 05:01:00 GMT" http://dustinteractive.com/post/106580303691/8-reasons-every-designer-should-build-an-app "Whether you’re a graphic designer, fashion designer, illustrator or sandwich artist, all creative people have one thing in common: you think about things differently. You can see through the surface of a problem that most people can’t. The ability to imagine something in your head and create it with your hands makes you extremely qualified to fix the broken things in the world. The smart phone revolution, with its open distribution platform and rapidly growing user reach, is making it easier than ever for creative minds to change the world.  Here are 8 reasons why you should take advantage of this opportunity: 1. Full Creative Freedom. If you’re fortunate enough to be involved with a creative team at your job, you know how thrilling it can be to see an idea come to life before your eyes. However, the truth is, you may never know true freedom until you create something entirely on your own. Without the client feedback, leadership egos, last minute timeline changes and budget cuts. This is your revenge. You’re the boss. For the first time in forever, your true creative ethos can run wild.  2. Fix Something That Sucks. It’s natural for you to want to use your creativity to improve things. Creative people see a layer between a problem and a solution that most people don’t. Chances are, you notice problems that a lot of people don’t even recognize. Find something that annoys you to the very core of your being. Your passion will push you towards an endless flow of solutions. It’s now your creative duty to bring the best one to life. Thomas Edison said it best: “There’s a way to do it better - find it.“  3. Failures Become Good. Failure is a good thing. As an artist you can understand this, however at your job you’re told the opposite. This is the reason we see so many reserved company cultures with shackled creativity. It’s your own time now, and every mess-up is at your own expense. There’s no job title or position at stake and there’s no money being burned. Every failure becomes a valuable lesson that you’ll remember forever and it won’t cost you a thing. This understanding will bring you bold and fearless decisions. The ones that lead to the amazing products that drive the world today. It’s like playing Super Mario with infinite lives.  4. No More Micromanagement Some may consider project management a weak area for creative people. The truth is, creatives can be incredibly strong project managers if they understand the strategy entirely and are given enough time to focus. It’s the constant disruption from micromanagement processes that can really throw off one’s creative energy. Imagine what the Mona Lisa would look like if Leonardo da Vinci had to check in with a project manager every 15 minutes. Whether you’re working alone or with a small team on your app, you will have to closely manage several tasks and disciplines. This experience is incredibly rewarding because it can be applied to so many other aspects of your life.  5. Appreciation For Other Peoples’ Jobs. Suddenly you need to come up with a catchy introductory paragraph for your app store description. It needs to be informative, yet brief. It’s best to make it about 5 sentences long, with keywords carefully picked to optimize for the app store’s rapidly-changing search engine algorithm. It can’t be too generic though, because it needs to stand out from the rest… but don’t forget about those keywords. Oh yeah, and if you don’t get this right, your app will immediately plunge to the bottom of the search rankings and everything you’ve worked so hard for will have been for nothing. Bet you’ll have a new respect for the creative writers of the world now, won’t you? Or project manager, or developer, etc. You’ll start to notice new things and will appreciate other disciplines more. For once, you’ve stood in their shoes.  6. Self Discovery. Like every journey in life, this one will certainly have its ups and downs. Whenever passion leads, discovery will follow. At times you’ll feel inspired and unstoppable, and other times defeated, discouraged and alone. Behind every barrier you face the same energy and creative spirit that inspired the idea will be waiting just around the corner to revive you. You will keep pushing and pushing, never giving up. You’ll discover hidden flaws, strengths, productivity patterns and personality traits that you never knew existed. Your integrity will be tested. When patience wears thin, the values that have kept you an artist will face the ultimate test. And like every struggle in life, the lowest lows will be the most memorable. As an artist, you fought through the deadliest force. You finished something that you started!  7. That Magic Moment. Everything will make sense when you finally see what you’ve built being used in real life. When you hear people talk about it, and how it helped them. You’ll immediately reflect on the struggles it took to get you there and will be overcome with a sense of pride that can’t be explained in words. You need to experience it yourself to find out.  8. It’s Never Been Easier. The best part is that it’s never been easier to get started. Whether you want to learn how to create an app entirely on your own or are looking to collaborate with a developer, there are a number of different resources available to help get you started. 1. Startup Weekend - A weekend-long event where developers, business managers, startup enthusiasts, marketing gurus, and graphic artists pitch ideas for new startup companies, form teams around those ideas, and work to develop a working prototype, demo, or presentation by Sunday evening. Look for a StartupWeekend happening in your city! 2. BuildItWithMe - A tool that connects design and development entrepreneurs. It exists to make creating apps easier by connecting you with like-minded designers and developers with the same goal: create cool and useful apps. 3. Sketch - Sketch is a professional vector graphics app with a beautiful interface and powerful tools. Sketch is not only affordable, but extremely intuitive when it comes to creating user interfaces in a flash. 4. Design+Code - Learn how to do it all on your own. This beautifully designed e-book will walk you through the process of building your own app, step-by-step, using Sketch and Xcode. Highly recommended. 5. Designer Fund - A community of designers who invest in designer founders through mentorship, funding, and access to the network. — My name is Dustin Rogers. I’m an interactive designer and appreneur in Columbus, Ohio. I enjoy meeting new people in the startup community and spend a lot of time drawing, running and dreaming up new ideas.
