How did that show and its success affect you personally and professionally?TL: I was on the second season. It was a big hit the first season—a water cooler show where people talked about it the next day. I thought, “Oh wow, what a cool job. I’m going to fly out to L.A. and do a couple of episodes. None of us, Darren (Criss) included, had an idea about the social effect that it was going to have. At that time teens were dealing with things like the Trevor Project and teen suicide and bullying. Because of the LGBT movement, kids were finding the courage to come out in high school, but they did not know how to deal with the ridicule and bullying they encountered. “Glee’s” creators of course wanted to create a hit show, but they also realized they had the eyes and ears of a captive audience—not just in America, but all over the world. They used the storyline between Darren Criss’s and Chris Colfer’s characters to empower kids who were being bullied, who were just coming out, and showed them a very healthy, loving relationship between two teenage boys on prime time television. And that was huge. The show said, “You’re not alone. You may feel really alone, because you don’t belong to any clique, but there is a clique for those people who don’t belong to any clique. And the common thing that will bond you all together is making music.”[Link to complete article]" True text

Do you think it made it easier to grow up gay?  I do, yeah. I mean, we didn’t have anything like that when we were growing up. Can you imagine if we had a show on network television that had a character like Chris Colfer’s character or Darren Criss’  character? And I think kids—not even gay kids, just kids in  general—were able to identify with at least a couple of the characters  on the show and say, Hey, that’s me. And I think a lot of kids who aren’t gay identified with Chris—you know, he’s a big, bestselling author right now.  And he has fans that run the gamut of different kinds of kids. Not just  gay kids, all kids of kids, because he was one of those unique, special,  said what he thought, stood up for himself, and didn’t let anyone tell  him there was something wrong with him. Kids just jumped on board. And  then you have my character (Sue Sylvester) of course, who just is the  person that told them what was wrong with them. And at the same time,  was kind of the protector. And I think that was, kind of, the ideal  place to be. McKinley High. The world of McKinley High, the hallway, was  kind of like the real world.

At least that was how the employees of the Santa Clara Convention Center  saw it. The success of the annual event was never measured by the  number of attendees (sold-out crowds were always a given) but by the  number of injuries the enthusiastic crowd inflicted on one another.Thankfully, the WizCon incidents were never malicious; the  patrons simply buzzed with so much excitement they became a danger to  themselves and others around them. So, the more reported accidents, the  more the event planners were confident they had done their job.And as the early comers outside pressed their bodies against  the glass doors, rabid with anticipation, the convention staff knew  WizCon 2017 was about to break new records.“It’s twelve-oh-one!” said a little boy dressed as a gray alien. “You were supposed to open at noon!”“Come on, we’ve been waiting for hours!” said an old woman dressed as a headless Marie-Antoinette.“Some of us have been here since yesterday!” said a very sleepy teenage girl from a group wearing dinosaur onesies.The convention center was surrounded with a massive gathering  of historical figures, extinct species, and extraterrestrial creatures.  It was an alarming sight to every passing observer, but it was much more  innocent than the psychedelic cult it appeared to be.All these people were at WizCon because they were fans of the hit television series Wiz Kids.  The show was an action/adventure series that followed a trio of young  geniuses who travel through space and time in an invention they  constructed out of a port-a-potty.Naturally, when it first premiered the critics treated the show  like a piñata. Each review of the “ridiculous premise” was more  scathing than the last. Reviewers took great pleasure in ripping it to  shreds and even became competitive with their convictions, each claiming  to have “hated it the most.” However, with each fatal blow Wiz Kids  only received more and more attention. People tuned in to see the  “absurdity” for themselves, but they were not repulsed as promised.  Audiences found the show’s campiness to be rather charming, its unique  underdog spirit resonated with them, and a global phenomenon was born.[Read much more]" True text

Sometimes it’s the comedy, sometimes it’s the mystery, sometimes it’s  the action… But one thing it seems that a show can’t get by without is,  *DUH*: the romance!

While they spent all their time focusing on one couple, it was actually  the side couple that everyone gave an eff about (or maybe we loved the  main pair, too, but it was the secondary one that just really gave us   all the ~feelz~, ya know?). No matter what the reason, we need to give  those overlooked couples the attention that they deserve… because, let’s  be honest here, they were a huge reason the show was the success at  all:TIE: Santana and Brittany & Kurt and Blaine on GleeWhen  Finchel was a thing, both Brittana and Klaine took the backseat for  Rachel and Finn’s romance in terms of screen time… yet the LGBT  couples were really the ones we cared about.Basically, same-sex couples FTW on Glee, now and forever — that’s why they got married!"

Hachette Audio. (Middle grade; ages 8 to 12)  “Frogkisser!” comes several years after the actor Chris Colfer started to publish his own fairy-tale-inspired books with a girl-power twist. Colfer’s series the Land of Stories follows a pair of 12-year-old twins who are magically sucked into a book of fairy tales. (My kids and I are on Vol. 3 of six of the hardcovers.) In Colfer’s books, damsels are rarely in distress. Goldilocks, for instance, is a sword-wielding warrior and Sleeping Beauty hasn’t slept in years because she’s working tirelessly to reform her kingdom.Colfer’s new audiobook, “The Land of Stories: A Treasury of Classic Fairy Tales,” is related to the series, but also a departure. It doesn’t feature the adventuring twins, but instead is a straightforward collection of fairy tales. Twenty-five stories from the Grimm brothers, Hans Christian Andersen and others, are retold and tidied up a bit by Colfer.I recommend it for three reasons. First, Colfer — an actor most famous for playing a countertenor teenager on “Glee” — is a wizard at voices. In “Henny Penny,” he gives distinct, birdlike cadences to a duck, a goose, hen, rooster and a turkey. His yawn from Goldilocks was convincing enough to make me yawn in the driver’s seat.Second, I want my sons to know the original fairy tales, and not just get them filtered through reinterpretations. We live in a world where kids ingest the parodies before the real thing. My children have seen multiple “Twilight Zone” takeoffs (on “Futurama,” for instance), but have never watched an episode of Rod Serling’s show. I suffer from this too. I knew the Puss in Boots character from “Shrek,” but embarrassingly had no notion of the original tale. (Which contains another useful moral: Blatant lies and fraud are the key to success.)Which brings me to my third reason, which is that fairy tales are great conversation starters. Not so much for the lessons they are trying to impart, which are often appalling, but as a way to spark interesting questions. When listening in the car, my kids and I talked about whether Jack is morally justified in stealing gold from the giant just because the giant is a terrible being. Also, does the maiden in “Rumpelstiltskin” owe nothing to the dwarf for his hard work? Perhaps not her firstborn, but at least a token?As I mentioned, Colfer has cleaned up the tales a bit. In terms of rawness, they fall somewhere between the Grimm and Disney versions. For instance, in the Grimm version, Cinderella’s stepsisters chop off a toe and a slice of heel to fit in the slipper. Disney’s “Cinderella” has no gore at all. Colfer’s compromise: The stepsister “crammed her foot inside the slipper so tightly it started to bleed.”Colfer has also, thankfully, left out the truly horrible Grimm stories, like their tale “The Jew in the Thorns,” about a miserly man who is sentenced to death. Not even Disney could make that palatable.But even when softened and redacted, listening to fairy tales can be demented, disturbing fun." True link

One must note that Andrew was a gigolo who craved for attention and the limelight. Darren is with Andrew Greenfield in this photo, whose role in the show has yet to be revealed.According to Vanity Fair, Gianni and Andrew had a connection before the murder. “They had come in contact in a San Francisco nightclub, Colossus, in 1990; Versace was in town because he had designed costumes for the San Francisco Opera. That night, October 21, an eyewitness recalls, Cunanan was smugly pleased that Versace seemed to recognize him,” the report said. It also detailed how Andrew “gushed over” meeting the fashion designer and how it was unclear how and when Gianni met him before recognizing him.Before Gianni’s murder, Andrew had already been on a killing spree, landing him in the Most Wanted list of the F.B.I.Apart from this, we also recently got to see Penelope Cruz donning platinum-blonde locks along with sleek and sexy ensembles as she takes on the role of Donatella Versace.Penelope took on the role that everyone thought Lady Gaga was a shoo-in for. Producer Ryan Murphy cleared up that Gaga’s schedule was too hectic to take on the five-month project in the first place.Ryan has also been posting photos of the set from Versace’s bell to his bedroom window.Edgar Ramirez, who will play Gianni Versace, also dropped a few photos from the set which feature the lavish Italian taste of the designer. Ricky Martin, who will play Gianni’s partner Antonio D’Amico, gives a more candid glimpse of the cast together.Versace: American Crime Story along with Katrina: American Crime Story are both lined up for 2018, following up the successful debut of the series which re-told the story of the O.J.

While many have entered and gained a mega boost of fame from their Glee days, few are making the variety of impact that Darren Criss is today.Since his days of playing the beloved Blaine Anderson in the Dalton Academy Warblers, Criss has since gone on to conquer a slew of different areas in Hollywood. He’s left his mark in the worlds of…and take a deep breath here…music (releasing a solo EP and currently promoting with his ‘80s-inspired duo Computer Games), Broadway (acting in successful stints with How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying and Hedwig and the Angry Inch), television (appearing in The Flash, Supergirl, and landing a role in the upcoming American Crime Story series), movies (making his feature film debut in Girl Most Likely alongside Kristen Wiig and Annette Bening), and even festival curation (he co-founded the annual Broadway-pop festival Elsie Fest). All the while, Criss has continued to be staunch advocate and ally to the LGBTQ community, being a major supporter to The Trevor Project, and speaking out for organizations like Rock the Vote, UNICEF, and Amnesty International. Got all that?Furthermore, Criss acts a shining success story of the underrepresented Asian American community in Hollywood. Along with his brother and Computer Games band mate Chuck, Darren told Fuse about the pride they have from being raised by a Filipino mother. “As you get older and you meet people who have other cultural backgrounds, you start to realize the differences and you either enjoy that difference or maybe it drives you nuts,” Darren shares in the video above. “I happen to really enjoy the fact that we’re half-Filipino, mainly because it’s such a sneak attack. Most people think we’re straight-up white kids.”With his projects boasting as much range as his multi-octave voice, there’s no doubt that Darren Criss can continue his multifaceted approach to taking over Hollywood and doing so with major pride for his culture and background."

The Trevor Project serves more than 100,000 LGBTQ youth every year with their life-saving programs that include the Trevor Lifeline, TrevorChat, Ask Trevor and TrevorSpace.The need for Trevor is very real – lesbian, gay and bisexual youth are more than 4X more likely than their straight peers to attempt suicide, and youth who are questioning their sexual orientation are 3X more likely. For youth between the ages of 10 and 24, suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death nationwide.“After gaining the incredible platform from ‘Glee,’ it wasn’t so much of a decision to get involved as it was an opportunity to take part. I’ll be honest, I’m not so much into the idea of one cause being more important than another; however, I felt that the Trevor Project was a perfect fit for my efforts. It stands for a lot of things that I believe in, as well as falls in line with much of what 'Glee’ stands for.” - Darren Criss, VarietyAlong with Chris and Darren, we support The Trevor Project because of the essential services and hope they provide.

The media platform is tapping big-name celebrities and major influencers in the LGBT community to throw its first-ever Queer Prom, a star-studded, red-carpet-style bash at Siren Studios in Hollywood on Saturday, May 13. The once-in-a-lifetime event will celebrate “everything a high school prom should be,” according to Buzzfeed, and emphasize themes like inclusivity, diversity, love, and self-expressionYou might be wondering, why throw a designated Queer Prom amidst all the other high school proms? According to Buzzfeed, it’s needed; LGBT youth across the country are often discouraged from participating in the planning of (or in some cases, even attending) their own proms. There’s an unspoken—or in some instances, very spoken—social pressure to follow the so-called “norm” of going to prom with the opposite sex, wearing a suit if you’re a guy and wearing a dress if you’re a girl. For many teens, there isn’t a safe space to express their individuality and enjoy the long-awaited milestone without a dreaded veil of discomfort.That’s where Buzzfeed plans to step in. The online platform is making a statement and throwing an inclusive, magical evening, hosted by Buzzfeed’s Eugene Lee Yang, open to people of all sexual orientations and gender identities, where they can celebrate unity and acceptance with music, dance, celebrity guests and more. Buzzfeed’s hand-selected Queer Prom Court (local high schoolers making a difference in their communities, each of whom will be flown out to Los Angeles and honored at the event) will be joined by students from local high schools, along with LBGT advocates and stars like Adam Lambert, Darren Criss, Latrice Royale, Margaret Cho and Ryan Murphy."

Those literary realms come crashing into reality in the sixth  and final installment titled “Worlds Collide,” which hits bookshelves  Tuesday. In the series closer, Alex has gone missing. Her brother  sets out to find her, and with the help of his fairy-tale friends tracks  her down in New York City. She’s under the control of the witch Morina  and her band of evildoers who are hatching a plan to take over the  world.Can Conner save Alex and stop these Land of Stories villains before it’s too late?While he’s never traveled through dimensions, Colfer confesses he’s a lot like his characters.“I  am Gemini, so that means I’m always thinking with two different  mindsets, which has been a blessing and a curse,” he says. “Alex  represents my people pleasing, smarter-than-my-own-good side, and Conner  is my sarcastic, class-clown side. So they’re very much me in different  forms.” Raised with a younger sister just outside of Fresno, Colfer began  writing “The Land of Stories” in grade school at the urging of his  mother.“My mom used to read fairy tales to me as a kid,” he says.  “I had so many questions about the characters and their motives that I  think she finally got annoyed and said, ‘Why don’t you write your own  fairy tales?’ So I started writing ‘The Land of Stories,’ promising  myself that if I ever got a chance to publish it, I would make it  happen.“I honestly think one of the reasons why the first book  has been so popular with kids is because it was technically written by  one,” he says, referring to “The Wishing Spell.” While he was big on imagination, Colfer admits he struggled with reading until J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter came along.“It  was the Harry Potter books that made me excited to read and made me  work hard on becoming a better reader so I could keep up with Harry,  Ron, and Hermione,” he says. “Some of the happiest memories of my  childhood were waiting at Barnes and Noble for the midnight release of  the next Harry Potter book, and being there with a roomful of nerds like  me. To think that I’m now contributing to the children’s literary world  in some ways means a lot to me.” Colfer is currently on a national tour, which includes a ticketed  event hosted by Children’s Book World at the Landmark Regent Theatre on  July 31. At these events, young fans always want to know, When’s the movie coming out?“I’ve  asked them for a lot of patience over the years because ever since the  first book (“The Wishing Spell”) came out, we’ve had an interest in this  becoming a film franchise,” he says.As it turns out, he’s busy adapting the first book in the series for the big screen in what will be his directorial debut. Most of his writing takes place in the guest bedroom of his  Laurel Canyon home. He sits a red desk, flanked by a pair of twin beds  outfitted in “Star Wars” and “Super Mario Bros.” sheets, listening to  film scores like “Lord of the Rings” or “Forrest Gump.” In fact, that’s  where he closed the book on Alex and Conner’s adventures in March.Or did he?“I  might go back and do a prequel series about the twins’ grandmother when  she was a young girl growing up,” Colfer says. “I can always do another  spinoff of something or other.

When I was a kid the acting bug and writing bug hit me at the same exact time. When you’re young, you just think of them as playing pretend. It wasn’t until I got a little older that I realized they were different things.”Colfer, who appears July 14 at Carnegie Lecture Hall in Oakland as guest of Pittsburgh Arts & Lectures New & Noted Series, has just published “The Land of Stories: Worlds Collide,” (Little Brown, $19.99). The book is the sixth and final installment in a best-selling young reader’s fantasy series that has its roots in Colfer’s childhood. The first book, in “The Land of Stories” series, “The Wishing Spell,” was culled from a story Colfer wrote when he was in grade school.Fortunately, his grandmother, a church minister with three doctorates, knew a little bit about writing.“My grandmother was the toughest editor I’ve ever worked with,” Colfer says. “My editor at Little, Brown, Alvina Ling, is a saint compared to my grandmother. (Ling) never crumpled up something I’ve written in front of me and said I can do better. … My grandmother was a great first editor because she encouraged me to keep going, but she was very honest if she thought I could do better. That kind of training early on made me raise the bar for myself.”His grandmother’s stern advice helped when Colfer made his publishing debut in 2012. While the book was a bestseller and earned generally good reviews, his young readers — the books are geared to ages 8 to 12 — had no qualms about voicing their concerns or criticisms about the book.“I thought writing for kids would be much easier than writing for adults, but it’s the toughest audience in the world,” Colfer says. “They have absolutely no filter when they meet you. If they have a critique or a comment, they will just say it. And you have to be prepared to answer why you wrote what you did. It’s very challenging, but I like it. It keeps me on my toes.”The series features Conner and Alex, a brother and sister who are gifted with a book of fairy tales that serves as a portal between reality and the fairy tale world. Throughout the “Land of Stories” books the siblings traverse between these two spheres. But in the final installment, the worlds merge into each other, with chaos ensuing.Colfer admits that ending the series is a bittersweet. But near the end of a “Worlds Collide,” he does cast some doubt about the series finale when Alex says “The end of our story? That’s funny, because I was afraid this was only the beginning.”“I love writing the series and it’s been one of the greatest joys of my entire life,” Colfer says. “While I do think this is the right moment to end it, I can definitely see myself coming back to it some day in the future. I don’t know if it would a continuation of Alex and Conner’s story, or maybe the next generation. Maybe their kids or grandkids are at the center of the next series. But I definitely wanted to leave something in their so even though the kids know the books are ending, Alex and Conner’s adventures will still continue in their hearts and minds.”All attendees at the July 14 event will receive one raffle ticket to meet Colfer at a VIP meet-and-greet after the event; those wearing costumes from “The Land of Stories” series will receive an additional raffle ticket" True link

I think the main thing to remember about any character you’re playing whether they’re real or not is your job as an actor, as a storyteller. I don’t even want to make it specific to actors. This goes to anybody who is a creative person. It’s your job to find as many common denominators with that person as possible.“It’s important, especially for me for this particular story. This is a real person who did really horrible, tragic things to real people. Their families are still affected by the things that he did. But I still maintain the idea that we all have more in common with someone like Andrew than we don’t.“Obviously, there are big variables. I’d like to think most of us don’t have actual murderous tendencies. However, at the end of the day, we are flesh and blood. We have mothers; we have fathers; we have dreams; we have hopes; we have regrets and failures that all make us who we are. So, the short answer is I found that we really do have a lot in common and that shouldn’t be misconstrued with the things that we know him for, which are obviously these horrible acts.“But there’s a certain point in all of our lives that could have taken us into this certain path. You really have to identify what those moments are so that as a viewer, you’re not just antagonizing this person from the get go because you know what he’s done. You have to understand how he got there and what the links are between you and that person. So I found an awful lot of those.”Sides to a storyDarren explained further that there are three different versions of Andrew Cunanan that he has to deal with.He said, “There is the real version that none of us knew. There is the version that people did know but even that person was like 20 different people and then there’s the version that we’re telling. So as an actor, I can try and contact these family members or friends but they’re all going to have a different answer of who he was because he had different names. He had different looks. He had different attitudes that weren’t parallel to each other. So for me, my job is to serve the script. And whoever the persons that we’ve painted in this particular version, which I’m sure people who knew Andrew will be like, he wasn’t like that. However for our story and for the way that we’re characterizing him, I have to honor what’s on the page.“So to me, what’s on the page and what’s in the script is my leader in this, and in Ryan and in people who are creating this. I’m serving their image of this story as much as I want to stay true to who he really was. We don’t know what kind of person he was so we just have to humanize him as much as possible and hope for the best.”Darren was just 10 years old when Versace died. So at what point in his life before this project, did he learn about Andrew, we asked.“I knew about the Versace murder just from general world facts,” Darren revealed. “I knew Versace was killed in front of his home. I’d been here before, the first time I went to Miami. I stopped by here. And I remember looking it up going, God, seeing the steps and I can’t believe they’re still here. This is so eerie. I vaguely remembered that he was half Filipino.“I think growing up half Filipino if there’s any half Filipino in the media you tend to pay attention to it. That was about it. I had, through the fabulous world of ‘Glee’ I had met Donatella. I had been to Versace’s home in Milan. And I had seen things about his history. But that was about as far of a connection that I had.“I don’t know if Ryan told you the story of how this came up. He brought this up to me about two, almost three years ago. I was having lunch with him in New Orleans. And I was joking with him about ‘Horror Story’ because he just announced Lady Gaga was going to be in it. So I jokingly said, hey let me know if you need a wily bellhop to show up on that show, I’ll do it. And he was, no, but there’s this other thing that I’m thinking about doing – Andrew. I looked it up and I was kind of spooked because he looks like me and my brother.“That was it. I didn’t think he would actually make the show. I ended up diving in pretty hard on researching the guy. I had to wipe my hands clean of it because I was, I don’t want to have to know all this stuff if I don’t need to know about it. It’s a very dark place to be in. So, cut to now, here we are and he kept up with his word.“While it is a very gruesome and dark project, it is an exciting project to be with him and with this prestigious group of people. So that was about all I knew. I definitely sense being involved I have this profound new connection to Versace and to the story. Like I said, being in this house for the past week has been extraordinarily moving. This isn’t to be romantic or spiritual, but he’s just in the house. Everything that he’s made that we all know the iconography of Gianni Versace, it is present in every turn. So seeing that has really given me a new profound appreciation of his work and appreciation of a great creator, someone who just wanted to relentlessly wreak beauty upon the world.”" True link

I was walking around and I was taking pictures. I took a picture of the pool, and I saw myself. I was like, oh my God, I’ve got to delete this photo. It’s horrible, how irreverent, because Andrew never made it inside.”In this part two of our column on Darren, we continue our talk about his biggest and most challenging role to date.What did you learn about Cunanan that informed your performance? The thing that we want to show in this is that we have two brilliant minds—we have Versace, the creator, and the destroyer (Cunanan). A lot of people who knew Andrew in his younger life described him as a promising, brilliant and charming young man. You go, what happened? It doesn’t follow the same blueprint of that of many serial killers, the Dahmers and the Mansons of the world. They’re off the rails from the get-go.Whereas Andrew, it was heartbreaking for a lot of people who knew him because we show some of his friends in the series. Andrew was the godfather of the children of a friend from high school who was mortified to hear that this had happened. Because he was this caring friend and godfather.So, he was not just an abomination. Yeah. That isn’t only on my shoulders, but in the order that we tell the story, without giving away too much. The structure of the show goes in such a way that we get to see Andrew at his worst and his absolute best. Then, it’s up to you to juxtapose those against each other.How do you tell a story where the moral compass is clearly fixed? We can all agree this is a horrible thing. Versace was murdered on the steps of his house. We’re in this house. The first day I came in here, I got emotional thinking about it. Versace is here, the man is still alive in this house, everywhere. Coming in, seeing this and being a part of it, you go, wow, this man had everything that the man who killed him couldn’t have and wanted so badly.I get very sad when I think of somebody like Andrew. We’ve all had these dreams of doing something great. That’s something we can relate to. It’s that sense of wanting something so bad and just being misdirected on how to get it.Following up on that, Asian immigrant families, including Filipinos, are known to be model immigrants. What do you think about him or his family that contributed to his downfall? I don’t have any credentials in psychology and child development but, to me, after diving into what his background is, it seems a pretty textbook case, as far as what happened later in his life.As a young man, Cunanan came from a very poor family and in one of the poorest neighborhoods in San Diego. His mother was mentally unstable, was very difficult to deal with. I don’t know what she had, but she self-medicated—a very tough situation.His father, on the other hand, was a crook. He was embezzling people out of thousands of dollars. It was a loveless marriage, but they adored and spoiled this little boy. They gave him their master bedroom as he grew up. He was raised with this sense of entitlement from a very early age. That’s very dangerous as you get out in the world.Narcissism involves people who think they’re pretty, but it’s more than that. It’s a psychological belief that if you believe something about yourself, it is true.In that sense, Andrew believed that if he could say something about himself, then that’s true. And if he deserves something, he didn’t have to work for it. So, the decisions he made before the murders were unintentionally implanted by his parents. His father was caught. He sold the house and had to eventually flee to the Philippines.This was where Andrew switched gears. He went to see his father [in the Philippines]. At this point in his life, Andrew has told a lot of lies about himself. He sometimes would totally discount his Filipino heritage. He would say he was Jewish, or that his father’s an Israeli pilot.He went to the Philippines believing in this façade that his father was this rich pineapple plantation owner. He saw this man living in relative squalor. I think when he saw his father being everything he wasn’t, and against everything that he ever wanted, that was a point where most of us would learn from that and go, OK, you know what? I can change from this. I don’t want to be like this. I want to work hard for things.Instead, he came back to the United States. For the rest of his life, he would make up stories. He’d blow up his own image of himself that would lead him to these grandiose acts of murder. Thinking that he’s above the law and above [the laws of] morality, because he doesn’t have to deal with the things that are real in his life.What insights did you learn about Cunanan’s homophobia? What’s fascinating to me? This is a wonderful extension of where we all are. Not once in my entire time that I’ve been involved with this has anybody ever brought up the fact that he was gay.I think mainly because it was eclipsed by the fact that he was a serial killer. That seems to be at the forefront of facts that people stick to. But, he was gay. I don’t think there was a homophobic bent to his series of murders. I think his homosexuality did lend him to certain scenes that he got to be a part of.The people he dealt with and ultimately ended up murdering were people he had met through different underworlds of the gay scene in San Diego and Minneapolis. He had self-hatred. I think there were other feelings of ineptitude and being not good enough that really drove him. I don’t know how much of that had to do with him being gay. But that is a big part of our story.It was the largest failed manhunt in FBI history. That seems like a big f***ing deal. A lot of people didn’t know about it. You have to scratch your head and you go, “Wait, so this guy killed how many people before Versace? How was he not caught?” He was on America’s most wanted list. Then, you start realizing, there’s a lot of fear and anxiety in law enforcement. And this is right after the worst part of the AIDS crisis in the mid-’90s.You have a lot of this other stuff that’s happening that does lend itself to how this guy got away with it. That is important to mention. One thing I’ll say about “American Crime Story” that I’m truly proud to be a part of is the fact that, to me, “OJ,” the series, wasn’t just about OJ.So, for our story yes, it’s about the horrible murder of an icon. And it’s about the journey and the downfall of the person who did it. But it’s also about everything that’s happening around—and how that echoes what we fear and deal with now." True link
darrenandchrisnews 162364037163 "2017-06-28 18:05:38 GMT" http://darrenandchrisnews.tumblr.com/post/162364037163/darren-criss-talks-about-his-most-challenging-role "Hearing that the award-winning executive producer-director cast him as Cunanan because he always knew there was a great dramatic actor in him, Darren gave a fittingly serious answer. Playing the serial killer, who murdered at least five people, is a big shift for Darren, who first worked with Ryan as Blaine Anderson in the musical TV series, “Glee.”“Oh, how far we’ve come,” Darren quipped with a laugh. He has taken off his gray suit jacket. “Miami heat is getting to my head,” he explained.We were in a room with walls gilded with mosaic tile work and stained glass windows, typical of the designer’s lavish home.Like Cunanan, Darren is Filipino-American. The actor— the son of a Cebuana, Cerina (nee Bru), and Charles William Criss from Pennsylvania— noted his eerie resemblance to Cunanan. The latter’s mom (Mary Anne Schillaci) is Italian-American, while his dad, Modesto Cunanan, is Filipino.For the actor who starred on Broadway in “Hedwig and the Angry Inch” and “How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,” this role represents his biggest and most dramatic challenge yet.Ryan, on a career high with his “Feud: Bette and Joan” and “The People v. OJ Simpson,” picked a fine cast to join Darren: Edgar Ramirez (Versace), Penelope Cruz (Donatella Versace) and Ricky Martin (Antonio D’Amico, Versace’s longtime lover).The FX miniseries, which continues to shoot, debuts in early 2018.Excerpts from our interview:Ryan Murphy said he always knew there was a great dramatic actor in you, and he wanted people to see that in this show. How scary or daunting is that for you? Actors are only as good as the parts they get to play. It’s a passive art form. People will hate me for saying that because obviously, when you’re doing it, it isn’t passive. But if I’m a musician, I can pick up my guitar and play it. If there was no one in this room, I can still play my guitar. I can proactively be a musician.I always say the best actors in the world, we’ll probably never know about. We’ll never get to see that guy do “King Lear,” that woman do “Hedda Gabler.” You have to wait for those moments.This is a moment for me, and I recognize that. I do feel like my ship came in for this one. “Glee” was a big hit before I was on it. I had a very objective relationship with it. I was in college when it was all over the place. So, to suddenly be thrust on it was a strange but very wonderful experience.It brings me here for which I’m unfathomably grateful. But I studied acting. I treat acting like a real craft as much as you love to roll your eyes at that little word. But it’s true. There’s no sense of entitlement. But I worked hard. I believe in doing the necessary steps to get to a certain place.So, to be finally be given this opportunity, I feel prepared. Whether or not it’s good is a whole other story. It could be horrible, crash and burn. But it’s like that—give me the ball, coach. And Ryan certainly gave me a good throw. So I’m very excited about that.You were 10 when Versace was killed. At what point in your life did you know about him? I knew Versace was killed in front of his home. I’d been here before, the first time I went to Miami. I remember looking it up, seeing the steps. This is so eerie. I vaguely remembered that he was half-Filipino. If there’s any half-Filipino in the media, you tend to pay attention to it.I had, through the fabulous world of “Glee,” met Donatella. I had been to Versace’s home in Milan. But, that was about as far as a connection that I had.Can you talk about filming the crucial assassination scene? It was gruesome. Because we were not shooting this in a sound studio in Los Angeles. This is the house—and people walking around here were there for that. We couldn’t hide it. It was in broad daylight. So, to feel that energy of this very real event, it weighed heavily on me.When I shot it, I was thrilled because Edgar wasn’t here for that. If I had to look in Edgar’s eyes and do something like that, that would have been tough, because it weighs on your conscience.But, as an actor, when you’re doing something like that, I’m not thinking of my conscience. As far as I’m concerned, I’m the hero in this story. That’s how I have to play it. There’s a certain longing, loss, confusion, hurt and just a f**kload of pain that is coming into an act like that.That’s what you have to channel. It helps that we’re in paradise because we do this really gruesome stuff, then I can go home and have a cocktail on the beach. It’s like, “All right, real life is OK.”Can you clarify why you didn’t film that scene with Edgar around? Only because that had to do more with the technical aspects. It’s highly technical, but the biggest meat of the shot was of me making the decision [to kill Versace] and going up [to him]. It’s giving a little bit away. So now, you know about that shot. Sorry, Ryan.How did you research on Andrew Cunanan? The series is mainly based on the book of Maureen Orth, who’s an extraordinary journalist and did mind-bending work and collection of data from friends, family and all records available.Read more: " True link
