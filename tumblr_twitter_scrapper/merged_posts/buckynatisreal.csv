There is the arrow necklace, a token to remind her of Clint. There is a burner phone she can’t bring herself to throw away because it connects her to Steve. The black belt with the red hourglass, a practical gift from Maria. The first gun Fury had permitted her. The Black Widow is not sentimental, can’t allow herself to be. Yet… but yet… no matter what cover she takes, she insists on keeping her hair a shade of red. A dangerous habit for a spy to keep, and one she can’t always adhere to, but. Whenever it is possible, her hair is red. Like autumn. Like fall. So that Winter may find her. " False text

You blush at his words, your own hands trailing across his wide back. He brings your leg up around his hip before pulling back slightly to look you in the eyes. “Are you ready?” he whispers, his breath fanning out across your lips. You nod, leaning up to kiss him in a tender kiss as he slides into you. A soft smile plays on your lips as you replay the memory, running your hand over his metal arm thrown across your front. His soft breathing can be heard as he sleeps deeply with his chest warmly against your back. Inhaling deeply you try to manoeuvre out of his grip without waking him. Sliding your legs across the cool sheets your feet are about to hit the soft carpet when you’re pulled back against Bucky. “Where do you think you’re going?” his voice is low and rough with sleep. You laugh softly as he pulls you towards him again. “Coffee” you mumble, feeling the need already. He simply shakes his head and presses a kiss to your bare shoulder.“Later” he mumbles against your quickly warming skin. He carefully moves you to your back to hover above you, smiling as he kisses your neck which elicits a giggle from you.Later never came but you did. " False text

Exhibit AThis is Beefy Seb: Seb bulked up, and trained like MAD for his role in Captain America: Civil War, after feeling pressure to have the same massive body type as Chris Evans and Anthony Mackie.It was hours of training including 4am starts, strictly regimented diets, and a dedication to the job that most actors wouldn’t even consider. Is it wrong to like him and find his body attractive? No. As a fan it would almost be an insult not to appreciate him like this, simply as an acknowledgement of the hard work he put in. Now, onto our next Exhibit: Exhibit B:Skinny Seb: Now, i don’t really want to label this ‘skinny Seb’. Really from what i can tell this is his almost ‘natural’ state (it was also taken a few years ago). Is it wrong to prefer him like this? No. I would imagine he was/is a little more carefree when he’s not having to train like mad, when he can relax and be himself. When his accolades come from his acting ability rather than his looks. (although he deserves a fucking oscar for his role as Bucky IMHO). Okay, still with me? Decided you want to send me some anon hate only to discover i don’t accept anon messages? Oh dear, you’ll just have to keep reading and stew in your own vitriol instead.  Exhibit C:Current 2017 Seb Current Seb. Or as i like to call it ‘Seb that destroyed most of China’s ovaries in one go thanks to this weibo selfie’. He’s still got his athletic build (last seen in The Bronze), but has also put in the work to bulk up (note: he now has wings made of muscle), but not uncomfortably so. You can see that his face shape is changing, he’s growing into his features that a lot of men do when they reach their 30′s. Proving that he got a good deal when he sold his soul to the devil (there’s no way someone can be this handsome by luck) he got the better end of the deal. But you know what? None of the above matter. He is still the lovable dork that answers fan’s questions on social media, that takes the time to stop his car when he’s been filming a movie all day, just to stop and say Hi to a fan that has driven a long way with her family on the off chance she might meet him.  He’s still the guy that is so dedicated to his work he will grow a mustache that gives us all very guilty Magnum PI flashbacks He’s the guy that is scared of a Squash Ball He’s the guy that has the weirdest ever facial expression when blowing birthday candles out. And we love him for who he is. Our Sebby. Our Romanian Dork. Our Beefy Bucky. Our Sebastian. And you can love him however you want. " False text

He’s trapped on the same train as Arnim Zola, and he’s terrified of being recaptured and experimented on again. Ever since his rescue from the Hydra facility, there’ve been signs that he’s not ok.   Bucky stops faking a smile the moment Steve turns away from him.   At the bar when Steve is recruiting the Howling Commandos, Bucky sits apart from everyone, tossing back whiskey like someone struggling with bad memories. He’s already got the thousand yard stare. And when he talks to Steve, it’s with an edge of false bravado.    When Steve first finds Bucky, he was repeating his name, rank and serial number like a mantra, a sign that he’d probably been interrogated and/or tortured. Another blogger pointed out that the bruises on his cheek and forehead look like they were caused by the equipment used to wipe him in CATWS. Zola, in all likelihood, had already begun the process of breaking Bucky down.  Can you imagine the courage it took for Bucky to follow Steve onto that train?  When Bucky said “I’m with you to the end of the line,” he meant every single word.  And yet he manages to pass it off with the Coney Island Cyclone joke!  You KNOW Bucky just wants to vomit, and not from the ride down to the train, but from what’s waiting for him there.  #all the bucky feels #wartime bucky is my favorite bucky #because for the first time in his life he’s faking it to steve #and steve doesn’t see it#he is already invisible #becoming a ghost was just the natural next step potofsoup how dare you with these tags " False text

Angst, mental disorders, PTSD, allusions to torture, explicit smut. If you are under 18, please walk away.    Author’s Note: A few weeks back I was watching Captain America: Civil War, as one does, and I was hung up on the idea of Bucky, as one is, and what happened to him before the events of CW kicked off. As it happened I was in a writing sort of mode, and spurred by that idea, and the fact that a close friend of mine was taking to my writing with some enthusiasm, I wrote a piece, sent it, and attached two possible titles to it, When in Romania and Last Night in Bucharest.  I was proud of it, because I felt I had managed to write this thing and keeping Bucky in character throughout, something I had been unsure I could do. As it turned out, she rather liked it, and she told me so in no uncertain terms, she settled on When in Romania as the title, and I was so excited that she liked it, and that it had made her happy to read! Then, after a few days she came to me with the suggestion that if When in Romania was her POV, then she felt that Last Night in Bucharest was his. Naturally I scoffed, and rolled around on the floor holding onto my ass, because not long before this I had been lamenting the impossibility of writing convincing smut from the male perspective. It was ridiculous for me to contemplate, I mean, I’ve only just started to write, and I think the female perspective is more than hard enough, not to mention I was happy to have managed to keep him in character from an outside view, I’d not planned on trying from an internal! With smut nonetheless! It was preposterous, and I dismissed the idea completely.  For 5 seconds, and then, 2 hours later, I had a 2.5K word intro about Bucky and his daily struggles post-TWS, and I kinda loved it. So yeah. Here we are. Two pieces, two POVs, almost 24K words. I have to say I’m proud of this, especially LNiB, I’ve never worked so hard on anything I’ve written before. Obviously some thanks are in order, and I’ll just do them now instead of waiting for the Pulitzer speech, here goes. To Ms. Grey, who no longer is on tumblr, but is one of my best and dearest friends and constants in my life, and without whom I probably wouldn’t even be writing at all, in addition to the invaluable editing she strained herself through, especially on LNiB. Thank you, I lote you more than words can say. *snuggles* To @missmoonchilde​, without whom I’d never been able to finish LNiB at all, that one note was the best and most important one I’d ever gotten, and whom I couldn’t function without in general. All the love forever. Thank you. To my dear @luv-assangiebatch. Thank you for sticking with me through the years, from the smoulders and the smut, and for making me attempting to write ekkporn at all. Thank you, I love you and I miss you. And last, to @hisredhenley, who this whole thing is written for in the first place, who got me to write LNiB, who is a source of joy and support every day, and who I love more than Sebastian Stan. Bold claim, but yes. Thank you. So much. Right. That was short and snappy as usual, and there’s not much more to say. If anyone do try to read this, please, feedback and thoughts will be appreciated. *slinks into oblivion* Alternate POV here. I could feel my hand slipping, but I couldn’t feel the wind.

Michael Douglas is producing the creepy thriller with Jared Goldman, Robert Mitas, and Robert Halmi Jr. while Stacie Passon is in the director’s seat. One of the better known stories by Jackson, a 20th century horror writer best known for her novel The Haunting of Hill House, the plot centers on an isolated family, which has already lost four members to poisoning, that uses rituals and talismans to keep itself away from hostile townspeople. Into this scenario arrives a distant cousin, intent on maliciously securing the family’s fortune, and whose arrival sets in motion the uncovering of family secrets.  Stan will play the cousin, Charles Blackwood. Passon wrote the adaptation with Mark Kruger.

They never had a chance, you know. They never really had a childhood, they never really had a life because they, you know, they were young and they were [their] only family. And then basically, they enlisted. And the war sort of like, took away their chance.

They might if former Gossip Girl cast member Sebastian Stan has a say in it. Amidst rumors of a reunion show, Stan said on Wednesday that he’d be down. “I would do it,” he told E! News at a Captain America: Civil War screening. “Why not?”“I got Jessica Szohr and Chace [Crawford],” he added, referring to the actors who play Vanessa Abrams and Nate Archibald. Stan played Carter Baizen, a graduate of St. Jude’s who briefly dates it-girl Serena van der Woodsen. Ed Westwick, who played bad boy Chuck Bass, has also said he’d like to do a reunion. The show’s fans may have learned who “Gossip Girl” is, but that hasn’t stopped them from being curious about the characters’ post-show lives. Hopefully, enough cast members will soon get together for a full-fledged reunion series.  " False link
