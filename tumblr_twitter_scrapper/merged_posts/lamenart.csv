Viktor’s at a restaurant waiting for the blind date Chris set him up with. It’s been a couple of minutes, but the dude’s not atrociously late. Might have been held up by traffic or whatever. He doesn’t have this person’s number or know what he looks like, all Chris told him was that he’d be wearing a blue coat/shirt/tie etc. or something distinctive like that. In walks Katsuki Yuuri, there for some reason or the other, maybe he’s dropping something off for one of his friends who’s a waiter at the restaurant or w/e, and who does he fucking see but Viktor Nikiforov—world-class skater and man of his dreams, sitting alone at a table looking bored? Yuuri figures his date is in the bathroom or something, cause that man looks sharp and is definitely dressed like he’s tryna get laid tonight, so he doesn’t want to disturb him, but he knows Phichit will definitely kill him if he doesn’t take the chance to get an autograph or pic or something. So he goes up to Viktor, who just zeroes in on BLUE, and then looks up and sees literally the most beautiful human being ever. Angels start singing, there’s a halo around this man’s head, he has an ass and thighs to die for, and that hip to waist ratio just sent him to hell tbh. Cue him mistaking Yuuri as his date, turning up his charm 10000%  and Yuuri being too awkward to say “WAIT NO, I’M JUST HERE FOR AN AUTOGRAPH” and shenanigans ensue  NOOO!

Only 14 years old. He probably had no family, and sold himself as a prostitute at a possible age of like 11 so that he could feed himself.  •He didn’t let anyone be rude to him, and he was mouthy with other people similar to Laurent. He understood slightly that what was happening to him was wrong (probably bc of Laurent tbh) but he made sure no one else treated him like lower class.  •Cared about Laurent completely. He risked his place and life by trying to visit Laurent in book one. Whether it was to make sure Laurent was okay, or to warn him, he still went. At the risk of himself (why else would he be fearful when asking Damen not to tell anyone he had been there). •Was a fucking unsung hero?? Paschal got the fucking letter from Nicaise. The regent was in possession of the letter in the beginning. Nicaise found it, read it, stole it, and gave it to Paschal at some point before Laurent’s men left for the border. Without Nicaise, there would have been absolutely no proof. Laurent and Damen both would have been convicted if not for Nicaise. Damen’s men would have been considered treasonous by Kastor’s side and executed (considering they weren’t even allowed in Akielos and everything Nik did had been lowkey; like stealing the pin). Hundreds of men dead. And because of Nicaise, they lived.  This fucking 14 year old, who lived his whole life trying to survive, saved two kingdoms from a terrible probably tyrannical rule and rescued Damen and Laurent from execution. He was probably terrified constantly, he probably cried when he was being killed. But he was the bravest fucking person in this story. And without him, captive prince wouldn’t have had such a beautiful ending. " False text
lamenart 160978008475 "2017-05-23 07:42:51 GMT" http://lamenart.tumblr.com/post/160978008475/few-things-to-keep-in-mind-about-damen "slecnaztemnot:  Damen is smart! CP isn’t a brain and brawn story. That’s kinda the point - Laurent looks like someone who only uses his brain and is useless in fight. But in reality, he is an excellent fighter. And Damen looks like someone who is only a good fighter, brute without a mind. But in reality he is a hella smart excellent tactician and he can actually read people pretty well. (remember how quickly he pointed out that Aimeric is going to be trouble?) Since the book is from Damen’s POV, we don’t really get a BIG revelation moment when Laurent (and readers) go “oh, he isn’t actually stupid at all, is he?”, just like we get an “Oh, he is actually a good fighter” with Laurent. But Damen is undeniably smart. I can understand why people might be tempted to write him as a simpleton, because Damen sincerely doesn’t have any talent for deception at all and isn’t as good in plots and master plans as Laurent. However, that doesn’t mean he is not intelligent.   Damen is very good with languages One proof of Damen’s intelligence is the fact he can speak (and write and read) several languages fluently. Don’t forget, he spends the majority of the books talking in Veretian, which isn’t his native language and it’s very different from language of Akielos, yet he never struggles with it. (in comparison, Laurent actually does struggle with Akielon) Damen also definitely speaks Vaskian and probably Patran. While he doesn’t speak the dialect of some Vaskian clans, he is still able to understand, at least partly. (even if we are talking AUs, Damen should still have this ability, considering it’s part of his character)  Damen is good ruler and leader Damen was brought up to be a king. He definitely knows how to run a country and he knows how to lead an army.  It’s weird some people believe that Damen needs Laurent’s assistance in ruling and is unable to perform basic tasks of everyday rulings of the country, because Damen was, as Laurent says “born to rule” and would know how to do all those things already. Maybe even better than Laurent himself. Considering Laurent wasn’t born to rule and we see Regent trying to deny him access to diplomatic proceedings, etc. - Laurent definitely knows the theory, but there is a question of how many opportunities he had to practice those skills. While Damen does not have many opportunities to show his ability to rule in the books, we can see that he is natural leader of men and that people respect him. He does have some problems with the discipline of his men at the beginning of the third book, but he is at a bad mental place at the time - and in a bad political situation.  Damen is a great tactician He is able to win fights considered unwinnable and when it comes to planning the battle, Laurent relies on him. I am seriously wondering who of two of them would win a chess match, for example.   TL’DR: Damen is smart, please do write him so " False text

Click here for Part One, Part Two, Part Three, and Part Five. 1. KintsugiYuuri Katsuki is a hitman burdened with a debt he can never repay. His target: Viktor Nikiforov, next Pakhan to one of the most dangerous families in the Russian mafia. When the two are drawn into a treacherous alliance after a mission gone wrong, the bonds of love and loyalty to family and duty begin to unravel—even as they get more tangled up in each other. 2. Those Second Thoughts You Asked For  The first time Victor skips backwards in time, he is fourteen years old.   3. Katsuki Yuuri Solemnly Swears That Time-Travel/Alternate Universe Bullshit Did Not Happen With The Intent to Piss Off Yuri PlisetskyHe is wrong. 4. Perfect BlueContrary to expectation, Phichit Chulanont, ice skating’s most media-savvy figure, wasn’t the person who confirmed Viktuuri. No, the honor goes to a Chinese seamstress dragged out of bed at 3 a.m. by a foreigner with too much money. And Katsuki Yuuri himself, who just wanted revenge for his blue tie (may it rest in peace). 5. Attachment JoyIf Yuuri and Viktor let go of each others’ hands, they’ll die. Or at least, that’s what they’re telling everyone. People are skeptical at first, but when days and then weeks go by without a sign of them so much as going to the bathroom without each other, everyone starts wondering what the hell is going on. Before they know it, the entire Russian figure skating team is obsessed with finding out, even if doing so includes sabotage, stalking, and some serious invasion of privacy. 6. Water’s EdgeFor years, Yuuri had heard people say Viktor’s skating was otherworldly. He never thought they were being literal. 7. Frostburn  Russia is a new place, with new rules. A new game. And Victor has played this game before, but never like this, never with Yuuri at his side. This is the first time he is playing with something to lose.   8. One WeekYuuri moves to Saint Petersburg after the Grand Prix and Victor offers him something he never expected. He has one week to decide. 9. This Body OverflowingYuuri has never wanted to be Victor Nikiforov. He wants to be owned by him instead; wants the whole world to see Victor in every move that he makes, like invisible handprints all over his skin. 10. Waiting for WorldsThings have gotten challenging recently for the skaters preparing for Nationals. 11. The Power of LoveYuuko and Yuuri dominate the singles skating competition as Japan’s power couple—except they aren’t a couple, and when their old skating idol stumbles into their personal life, everything rapidly goes downhill.  12. Call Everything on the Ice…In which Victor learns Japanese while in Hasetsu, and it vastly improves his ability to communicate with Yuuri. (It makes everything worse.)   13. I See Red (and we connect)  Two important things happened to Victor Nikiforov the night he won his fifth Grand Prix Final gold. The first: He met Japanese skater Yuuri Katsuki and accidentally offended him. The second: A red string appeared on his finger.   14. My beloved was weighed down.In which things aren’t always perfect, and the world shows its shitty side in the face of your most perfect happiness. All Victor can do is protect Yuuri. 15. love at second sightAfter the Grand Prix Final, Victor struggles back into skating and settles into his life with Yuuri. 16. i feel like i win when i loseYuuri’s life is a mess. He came a spectacular last in the Grand Prix Finals, drank too much at the banquet, initiated no fewer than three dance-offs, took his shirt off, wore his tie like a headband, pole-danced in his underpants, made a fool of himself in front of ISU officials—and now, somehow, he’s Viktor Nikiforov’s booty call. 17. rumour has itViktor Nikiforov is a genius. He tops the level without having to study and he can perform most spells without his wand. He was the second-ever first-year Seeker in the school, and the first Slytherin one at that. He’s a Parselmouth and he’s tamed the other basilisk hidden in the school’s plumbing. He has washboard abs and really defined hipbones. He’s the only son in a long line of pureblood Slytherins and he’s half-Veela and he can speak Mermish and he was born as Voldemort’s secret daughter which is why he’s prettier than half of the girls in school and— “Where do you even get all these?” Viktor asks, eyebrows drawn together in bemusement. “I’m not even a pureblood, I’m Muggleborn.” 18. salchow furyWhen asked what it feels like to be both the youngest ranger in the PPDC and the legendary Viktor Nikiforov’s co-pilot, Yuri Plisetsky looks at the camera dead on and says, “Like walking in on your parents having sex. Continuously.” I need to slow down the rate at which I read fanfic. Maybe I should devote some of my energy to finishing the Temeraire series. I literally have a Chapters bag full of unread books sitting on my bedroom floor. " False text

A big bang is where artist and writers combine to create new content. Everything created will be posted around the same time, and that means lots of new content for the fandom to enjoy!  What will writers do? Writers will write fanfiction about Victuri. 5,000 words is the minimum word count for the fanfiction. This means that the fanfiction can not be less than 5,000 words, but it can be longer!  What will artist do? Artist will create a fan art of Victuri, of course. Only 1 fan art is required! However artists can create more than 1 fan art if they want to!  What we plan on doing. We plan on pairing artists and writers together so there will be fan art that goes with a fanfiction. Artists and writers can work separately; this means that we will NOT pair you up with anyone and you are free to do your own thing! PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD!  If you think there’s a writer or artist who might be interested, please let them know about the event!

Chris keeps smelling salts on hand for his oh so delicate friend. “Oh dear, did poor Mr. Nikiforov fall ill again? Whatever could have happened?” “I understand that Mr. Katsuki smiled in his direction and Mr. Nikiforov fell into a swoon.” “Good heavens!”  Yuuri, writing in his journal that evening:  “I had thought I looked well in my new blue waistcoat, but upon seeing me in it, Mr Nikiforov swooned from what was no doubt dismayed shock, so I suppose not.”   Further entries in Yuuri’s journal: “I went calling upon Mr. Nikiforov today, who seems to be recovering from his illness. We took a most pleasant walk around his estate, but when the terrain became uneven, I was perhaps too bold and offered Mr. Nikiforov my hand, which caused him to develop a case of the vapors! I tried to offer my handkerchief as he was perspiring most profusely, but his knees gave out and he collapsed to the ground! Is my presence truly so offensive to him?”  Victor, relating the incident to Chris:  “When he suggested a walk about the grounds, I thought perhaps he might propose! Alas, he did not. But our hands touched! His perfect skin brushed mine; I almost died right there! And then he offered me his handkerchief!! It smelled so divine, I fell to my knees in worship.” While Mr. Giacometti and Mr. Chulanont appear to be ardent supporters of the the match, young Mr. Plisetsky has condemned both Mr. Katsuki and Mr. Nikiforov as an utter disgrace and their behavior the height of impropriety. His opinion of Mr. Katsuki is particularly unfavorable, but his judgement is perhaps colored by the unfortunate affair in which Mr. Katsuki became inebriated at a ball and challenged Mr. Plisetsky to test their skills against one another in the subject of dancing, to which Mr. Katsuki soundly defeated the youth.
