OP isnt making a radical statement- this is true! it took me years to realize that someone doesnt need to talk to me 24/7 to like me. in fact, they have their OWN life and are allowed to have other friends and its unhealthy to expect them to dedicate all of their time to me. i would get so angry when my favorite person wasnt talking to me but now i realize its unfair to both of us to expect them to be able to talk all the time. and yep, this site made it seem like me begging this person to talk to me constantly and get angry at them for having a life is normal and healthy. it isnt! it isnt “neurotypical” to let people have their own lives. its still hard for me! but you can ask for reassurance and remind yourself that its not healthy to expect someone to be able to talk to you 24/7. its hard, i know, but stop saying healthy behaviors are “neurotypical” and stop normalizing unhealthy behaviors that often can turn abusive (yes, getting pissed off at your partner for having a life or talking to people that arent you IS emotionally abusive behavior) " False text

They take in carriage horses who can no longer pull carriages or young horses who can’t carry riders due to injury or conformation issues and give them a safe home so they don’t have to go to slaughter. Unfortunately, last year was a bad season for growing hay, and they had to pay more than their budget to feed the horses throughout the winter. Now they’re short on hay AND cash and asking for help. The page for the hay drive is here. A bale of hay only costs $5CAD. I know a lot of us are broke as fuck but if you can spare $5 to help my horse friends, or even just pass this on, I would appreciate it so much!

Ulysses is a carriage horse who can no longer pull a carriage and Saari was a neglect case who came to us underweight and with laminitis. Remady, a sweet young mare with neuro and possibly physio issues. Rocky, a racer who broke an ankle and can no longer race Buddy, AHT’s first rescue Jack, a sweet boy who can’t be used for riding because he has Shivers Smouch, who can’t carry a rider due to a conformation problem And finally, our only pony, Chocolate!

With less than 1% of homes featuring disability access, I will be homeless without your help. If I’m left on the street in my condition, I will not survive. I’ve found an exceptionally rare accessible apartment adjacent to medical facilities. This could drastically improve treatment access & stop my frightening deterioration. A total of $5,063 is needed over the next few days to secure this. I need donations to a registered charity that can support the additional cost of homes with disability access features at approx. $97/week, or ~$5k to guarantee long term rent in lieu of ongoing donations.  PLEASE DONATE HEREDonations count needed:  $1,679 AUD$115 raised.  NB: If my situation changes, donations may be used for new ramp/s (up to $6,800) or emergency housing instead. More info below. Keep reading  This looks extremely fake.  First up, the documents on the account show the name ‘Angi Dong’.  Doing a quick search on the web, multiple other tumblrs (now deactivated) show up purporting a similar scenario: I need X dollars or I will be homeless.  There are also multiple other donation sites listed under ‘Angie Dong’ with an E in Angie, that show thousands of dollars donated just last year after a similar story was circulated. Other blog post (fnugg is not longer accessible): Other go fund me’s: Second one: Finally the documents on the current tumblr blog circulating this showing the name as ‘Angi Dong’ and not ‘Angie Dong’. I understand that housing can be a recurring issue, that lawyers and disability assistance takes time, but usually legitimate cases include: - correct name on all documents and on all communications- a single go fund me, or similar donation method - updates on progress, updated medical documents or legal documents- updated photos of the person requiring donation assistance This screams fake to me, but OP is welcome to prove me wrong.  It says “Anqi” which you would know if you can read. it is my god damn legal name which is supplemented with Anglicisation, which almost every ethnic or asian uses. You’re obviously a wanker who a) cannot read, b) does not understand the permanence of disabilities, c) just want to make yourself look good by writing a poorly thought out debunk post   That’s not the only thing they mentioned. You’ve created 3-4 simultaneous accounts all for the same thing; and for the last year you’ve been constantly saying that it’s urgent every time or else you will die.  Once is happenstance, twice is coincidence, the third time it’s enemy action - Ian Fleming. Please give evidence.  Right, i’ve seen several variations of this same post going around for over a year and after looking into it, I can’t bite my tongue anymore. Anqi/Angie Dong is not only a likely scam artist but a generally awful person.Amongst other things:The amount needed for accommodation she is being “forced to leave” has ranged from $490 to $1600, depending on which post you look atThe fundraising target changes every day, decreasing and then increasing dramatically, always with the threat that Anqi will die or be homeless without the thousands she receives in the next 24 hours (despite having a total of $73,980 available to her at the time of posting, after adding up all the crowdfunding links)I know the Aussie rental market’s a dumpster fire right now but no fucking way does an apartment cost $5,063. Even if this were to go towards a rental bond (for which the maximum amount that can legally be taken is four weeks in advance), that would mean she’s looking at an apartment that costs $1,265.75 (rather specifically) per week. Nuh-uh. Only if you’re looking at a 3br house in the most affluent suburbs in Sydney…Numerous fundraising sources including YouCaring (1 | 2), GoFundMe (in which she would demand money daily despite being able to access the thousands in funds that were already there at any point), and now The Developing FoundationThe Developing Foundation are supposedly subsidizing “the extra cost of apartments w/ accessibility features at approx. $97/week” - however, this is not a service they provide for membersExplicitly telling people never to contact the alleged charities or services involved…?Brachial neuritis affects the nerves that are linked with the arms and shoulders, causing weakness, which combined with brain inflammation and the host of other alleged ailments would impede her ability to be online day asking for moneySouth Care Medical & First Aid, who supposedly provide transport services, have never heard of her, nor do they provide such a service - they do medical event coverage and first aid training, in a different city than the one Angie lives inThe letters supplied as evidence can either be easily typed in Word/Excel or copied-and-pasted - it also contains nonsensical terms that a medical professional simply would not useGoogling a previous address she used for fundraising (romana2252@gmail.com) led to a registered domain in her name and a residential address that is actually North Shore Hotel in Sydney - so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯The language and currency used previously has been American (asking for donations in USD and references to “social security payment”) despite later claims to be based in AustraliaSupposing all the supporting documents Angie’s produced were true, she would be eligible to receive the Disability Support Pension and Mobility Allowance via Australia’s welfare system, as well as access to the National Disability Insurance Scheme - all of which would address and at least partially subsidize the issues of transport, accommodation etc. - making it rather curious that none of this has occurred. In fact, at the time of one of her biggest fundraising campaigns, she was receiving Youth Allowance, the eligibility for which is doing “approved activities” such as working or studying (seriously, our system isn’t perfect but it could be a hell of a lot worse compared to elsewhere)Several fake Tumblrs have been made pretending to be friends of Angie and sending asks to people requesting donation on Angie’s behalfThe profile picture that Angie used when she started asking for donations does not match the current representations of herselfTargeted disabled black women as having an ‘obligation’ to provide their labour for her needsHas also said some shit about the trans community and bisexuals (2) while harassing them for donationsGot bitter over a person “who’s probably a cishet ally” raising more funds than her and telling people to give their money to her rather than helping “paint some straight fucker’s house rainbow” Also “whitey”I think that covers it but this has been bothering me since it started popping up on my dash (and suspiciously frequently). I hate to think this casts a shadow of doubt on people who really do need assistance and support, but they also don’t need an exploitative and abusive person making things even harder for them to get it. someone I follow, who honestly usually has good judgement, has been reblogging this person’s fundraising posts consistently for ages, so I’ve watched the situation look fishier and fishier in realtime. Anyone’s heart would go out to a disabled person alone in a desperate situation, but this person asks for outrageous sum after outrageous sum of money, for legal costs, medical costs, housing, you name it, always with absurdly urgent deadlines and catastrophic consequences if the funds are not raised… and then no updates about how any of those situations turn out. Just more panicked posts begging for more money, to prevent a new parade of impending disasters.They also go through usernames like I’ve been going through Kleenex with this spring cold I’ve got. Ever since these posts have started crossing my dash like… I want to say a little over half a year ago, they’ve gone through four different usernames, each filled with very little apart from their own fundraising posts.The fact that a disabled Australian in such dire straits would surely have at least a couple well-equipped, experienced organizations and charities to turn to instead of apparently crowdsourcing all of their many needs from a blogging site filled with broke randos and kids is a whole other story.Survey says: it’s a scam, guys. donate to a registered and accredited organization, support your local PwD today!"

One of the more popular stories was that of Hind Bint al-Nu`man, the Christian daughter of the last Lakhmid king of Hira in the seventh century, and Hind Bint al-Khuss al-Iyadiyyah from Yamama in Arabia, known as al-Zarqa’, who were praised by poets and writers for their devotion to each other. Also, Arabic texts related to eroticism also mention lesbian women. The thirteenth-century Tunisian writer Shihab al-Din Ahmad al-Tifashi describes the local lesbian community, and how these women taught each other various practices. Amer uses this evidence to explain, ‘Arab lesbians were both named and visible in medieval Arabic literature. Moreover, and in contrast to their status in the medieval West in the same period, for example, Arab lesbians were not considered guilty of a “silent sin,” and there is no clear evidence that their “crime” was punished by death. In fact, lesbianism in the medieval Islamicate literary world was a topic deemed worthy of discussion and a lifestyle worthy of emulation.’ ”  @wlwoc @arabsapphics @middleeasternsarecool " False link

Sentencing happens next month — I could spend up to a year in jail, or be fined, or both. Just because I let out a chuckle at a public hearing.  She was convicted. My American acquaintances who support the Orange One pretend this did not happen, in fact - that nothing out of ordinary ever happened since the elections, and I hear more and more “I don’t follow American politics”. Like hell you don’t, cowards.   " False link

I came prepared, with printed and highlighted court cases, state statutes, and title IX excerpts. They didn’t listen, and refused to provide notes on the meeting or confirm that they had plans to punish me. I listened for about a week, and like before, I grew bolder, and stopped. I concurrently sent a FOIA Request for the communication between the school administration and the attorney, and after that was denied, submitted another request for a clarification of what happened in the meeting and the guidance they had given me. I was called down to my dean’s office and told to calm down. I didn’t. I instead sent my principal a letter and CC’d every faculty member of importance at the school. Mr. Jay Hoffmann and Associates, I regret to inform you that I sustained a mild head trauma some time before break, I am in fair condition and high spirits, but I must alert you to the fact that my memory was slightly affected by the incident and I have lost the ability to recall a particular event that took place in mid October, 2011. While I am not completely able to remember the exact happenings of said event, through a series of email searches I have managed to determine that this meeting concerned my ability to use the bathroom while attending school, but I have no recollection as to what specifically happened at the aforementioned meeting. If there happened to be anything of importance said during the October meeting concerning special instructions on how I am supposed to function within the school due to your understanding of my body or identity, I would like to know. Due to my active role within my community, the chances of me sustaining another memory altering head injury within the near future are staggeringly high — if you and your staff would like to avoid explaining what happened in the initial meeting and subsequent meetings with great frequency, as further head injuries occur, I highly suggest that you provide me with an official letter concerning any special instructions or punitive actions to be taken against me if I fail to comply. Since this head injury, I have used the school’s facilities as permitted by the Illinois Human Rights Act and will continue to do so until I am told differently in writing. Please note that any punitive actions taken against me will most likely result in a filing with the Human Rights Committee, FOIA requests for all communications pertaining to the event, press releases, news tips, and the raising of community awareness. I didn’t get called to the office anymore after this. In fact, the administration refused to speak with me until after I graduated. I didn’t get in trouble, and since I left, there have been roughly a dozen other trans kids who have gone un-bothered by the administration Could this have gone differently, particularly if I wasn’t in a state with laws on the books to help me? Definitely. But the point is, draconian laws are much harder to enforce on people who will fight you. If you’re a trans high schooler, have Title IX complaints typed up — yes, you can still file those — and let your administration know that you have them. Go scream at your school board until they carry you out. Show up at your principal’s office until you become a nuisance. Fax your superintendent until their machine runs out of ink. Send FOIA requests for everything you can think of, costing your school time and money. They want us to cower, so don’t.  I am proud to share a state with this young woman. Fantastic work, @alx-972 and that’s some seriously awesome lateral thinking.  Congratulations on graduation and keep fighting and inspiring! " False link

No, not that way, silly. I write under the name A. E. D'orsay, and I’m looking to pay an artist to bring my words to life, to give the five amazing gals in my book series ContraMagica a chance to succeed instead of fail. ContraMagica is a book series of what I think is going to be 11 books, and features a Native bisexual trans woman, a Black lesbian, a straight Latina, a bisexual Pacific Islander woman, and an asexual European descent woman who all gain a second chance at life as College age women in return for saving the world from the Agents of Oppression. There is a sorority. Hey, don’t make this weird. I’m already on my knees asking. When Chicory “Chic” Domane meets a mysterious white-haired woman at a political protest, it sets off an incredible chain of events that leads her to a new family, new loves, new chances … and a world of magic where demigods have come to life and threaten freedom everywhere. It falls to Chicory and her friends to stand against these Agents of Oblivion, and so begin a journey that will push them to their limits and test them to the core. They are the Contras, and their new lives and powerful abilities are our only hope to save the world. You can check out the 1st 10 chapters of The Magica, the first book, for free, here. Or, you can purchase the book here. In short, it is an actual light novel. For a Western audience. The book features what all the kids these days are calling “magical girls” – college age magical girls. An anime/manga inspired set of pics would help to celebrate them in the world of conventions and fan art, and build interest and attract attention of the folks who I think will have a lot of fun reading these books. Chic, Tally, Lark, Dom, and Tansy all firmly assure me this is the right way to go. Very firmly. I have lumps… For this kind of work, good imagery is considered essential to being able to market it effectively, and for that task I want to bring in someone who knows what it is like to be a woman who is marginalized in multiple ways, and so support an artist who is needing that chance.
