Medieval Children? Did children exist in the Middle Ages? It seems a silly question, but for some time it was a commonplace in historical scholarship that childhood as a notion was alien to the medieval mentality. Philippe Ariès expressed this view thus (Ariès 1962, 128): In medieval society the idea of childhood did not exist; this is not to suggest that children were neglected, forsaken or despised. The idea of childhood is not to be confused with affection for children: it corresponds to an awareness of the particular nature of childhood, that particular nature which distinguishes the child from the adult, even the young adult. In medieval society this awareness was lacking." True text

In my paper I am going to concentrate on the specific example of identity forma- tion during the Middle Ages in a multiethnic and multilingual region from East-Central Europe, that is in Transylvania. A multiethnic and multilingual region is a place where the experience of identity is expected to be stronger and the dynamic of the processes of identification, self-identification and building of otherness is more easily discernible. As a result of the consolidation of the Christian monarchy in Hungary, its easternmost region, conquered in the eleventh century by the Arpadian kings, suffered a continuous flow of various ethnic groups, thus becoming a place of meeting and cohabitation for Romanians, Slavs, Hungarians, Szeklers, Pechenegues, Germans, Valloons, Flemings, Italians, etc.. This ethnic diversity was achieved during the organization of Transylvania by the Hungarian kings through colonization, a process extended until the end of the thirteenth century. Such an ethnic and linguistic heterogeneity has necessarily triggered processes of consolidation of group identity as well as assimilation or the adoption by groups or individuals of another group’s identity.

Amber can sometimes contain insects, twigs, bark, small vertebrates, and leaves. Although not mineralized, it is often classified as a gemstone of organic origin (Anderson 1995). Various cultures have referred to it by many names: “sea gold”, “electron”, “hardened honey”, “tiger’s soul”, “the gold of the North”, and “tears of the gods”. Amber is known to mineralogists as succinite (lat. Succinum) or “gum-stone”. The Greek name for amber was elektron, and was connected to the Sun god, one of whose titles was the “Elector” or the “Awakener”. It is also associated with the word “electricity”, because amber becomes electrically charged when rubbed with a cloth and can attract small particles. The word electrum is a Latinized form of the Greek name elektron, a metallic substance consisting of gold alloyed with silver. The electrum is pale yellow or yellowish-white, and it is called the “white gold” or the “pale gold”. The same word was also used for the substance amber, probably because of the pale yellow color of certain varieties, and it is from the electrostatic properties of amber that the modern English words “electron” and “electricity” derive. The modern name “amber” comes from Arabic, meaning “ambergris”, the waxy aromatic substance created in the intestines of sperm whales (Lucas-Harris 1934: 191-192; 392-394). There are many varieties of amber; some are a very rare occurrence in nature. Amber beads are mainly separated by their color, transparency, texture or grains, and locality. Amber occurs in a range of different colors: the usual yellow-orange (amber color), pale lemon yellow, brown, and black. Other uncommon colors include red (cherry amber), green, and blue.

Faundez Marymount University, Marymount Honors Program (2010) Abstract This work will avoid the romanticized notions of the knight of the Middle Ages and will instead focus on the abilities these men were required to have as skilled warriors in comparison to those required from the thegns and the housecarls. It will begin with a study of the Late Anglo-Saxon military to be followed with the establishment of the housecarl by the Danish monarchs of the late tenth and early eleventh centuries in England. The thegn and the housecarl will be shown as somewhat “training figures” for what the Normans would eventually bring over to the island: individuals that made the transition not too radical. Lastly it will look at the already settled army organization of the Anglo-Norman period that began in the late eleventh century, to determine which elements from the Anglo-Saxon past remained in the figure of the knight. Therefore, while it will show that the knight was indeed introduced by the tip of his sword during the Norman invasion, it will also indicate how the original Saxon warrior paved his path with the tip of his own sword. “How did the nobles become noble in the first place?” William Thatcher asks in the movie A Knights Tale, angered by the fact that his friends have reminded him that to become a knight he has to be of noble birth. Yet despite the inaccuracies and unforgivable mistakes of the movie, the answer Thatcher gives illustrates a good point about the medieval history of England. “They took it! At the tip of a sword!” he responds. And yes it was at the tip of many swords that the Normans conquerors became the new nobles of England in 1066 A.D. At the tip of a sword they also introduced the knight that William Thatcher longed to be. Though the movie takes place in the late fourteenth century, when the image of knight had already been idealized to fit the models of courtly literature, William does remind us of the martial beginnings of these warriors by indicating that it was at the “tip of a sword” that they reached their place."

In the last three decades a number of studies has been carried out to examine the medieval noble society of the Hungarian Kingdom (I prefer this term to “Hungarian nobility” for greater clarity: even though nobles constituted the political nation of Hungary, ethnically many of them were not Hungarian) and well-trained scholars have taken on the task of penetrating the urban society of the same entity as far as possible. However, very few attempts have been made to describe and compare these two structures on a micro-level, on the level of families.  The family of a noble was not family in the modern sense of the word; it should sooner be described as a clan. The clan was the unity of those who had the same ancestors, but regarding property this only included the male descendants. If we look for the binding that for many generations held the micro spheres of noble society together as strongly as fiefs did in Western-Europe, we find the clan. The basic element of the birth of a clan was a kind of individualisation: breaking away from the genus through partition of the lands owned by the living male members. Until 1343 the partition was done drastically: whole villages and regions became the property of on or the other branch of the genus. In 1343 a royal decree ordered that the partition must point to a division of each units. This was probably the request of many branches: thanks to the geographical proximity, it became much easier to claim the rights of the lands of other disappearing branches. " True text

Monastic chronicles can be harsh in their judgements of abbots. An abbacy was often well covered in these chronicles and things such as patrimony preservation was important. Not all abbots were able to meet this minimum standard, especially during difficult times like during Stephen’s reign in the twelfth century. The Liber Eliensis has nothing good to say about Bishop Nigel under Stephen’s reign. Every time he switched allegiance between Matilda and Stephen, Ely lost. He did a terrible job keeping the patrimony of Ely. Due to this upheaval, a factional split occurred; one side felt that Nigel was wholly to blame for the abbey’s loss and the other side that agreed there were mitigating circumstances excusing his actions during his abbacy. The right of the abbot to alienate church lands was questionable at best. Paxton gave the example of the Abbot Swinlea who used the church’s seal and did what he wanted during his abbacy. Many of his inappropriate uses of the seal for documents were broken after his death. His monks did not agree with his actions and wanted to protect the monastery. Then Paxton described the monetary losses suffered through Abbot Ingulf. Abbot Ingulf gathered money and allowed Stephen to plunder it - all the money was removed from the monastery to pay for the debt. Ingulf asked for forgiveness of the sins he committed during his abbacy. He was replaced by an abbot appointed by a young King Henry II. The Abingdon chronicler reflected the views of the sacristy; it juxtaposed the successes of the sacristy against the failures of the abbot. The author was kinder to Ingulf and paints a more forgiving picture of him. He counters the sacristy’s version of events in the chronicle and makes excuses for his actions and financial failures. There emerge two contrasting pictures of abbot Ingulf - one blames the abbot, one blames treachery and hard times for these losses. Was his response and leadership proper during such difficult times? These were times where abbots had to make tough decisions. Polarised factions emerged and what mattered after the fact was whether particular transactions ended up benefiting or harming the monastery. It was a veritable medieval “spin room”. ~Sandra Alvarez" True text

This paper investigated the language used in Easter catechises by Bede and did not focus on the actual conversion of kings but the language written about them by Bede. There was deliberate didactic construction that demonstrated Bede’s concerns with the Northumbrian church and how he “made” formerly Pagan kings appropriate catechumens by describing the physical and spiritual catechumen’s process of conversion. The catechumen submitted his name for baptism and underwent a month long process, which included exorcisms, complex anointing and other rituals over Lenten period until the baptism occured at Easter. Bede narrated this transition and described how Pagan kings accepted Christianity. Royal conversion was a lengthy process, and was a combination of instruction and ritual events. According to Bede there were two periods of Cathecesis: 1.) Kings received catechises through Roman missionaries, education, preaching and holy example. Bede mentions King Aethelbert of Kent and how he was won over to the Christian faith. 2.) The acceptance of faith – Demonstrated by taking up Chritian practices and abandoning Pagan ones, like more than one wife and worshipping Pagan idols. Bede considered kings who reverted to Paganism, “Christian apostates” even if they weren’t baptised. According to these royal narratives of conversion, they were Christians before they accepted the faith. This second phase could take several months but Bede bounded the second phase of catechesis in a liturgical time frame. Bede wrote extensively on King Edwin of Northumbria’s conversion narrative. Edwin’s example demonstrates the ideal liturgical model required for conversion and preparation for baptism. Bede’s text was a tool for the battle against Paganism and a history of England’s conversion. Bede worked to continue the conversion process that had begun with earlier missionaries in England. His work was the story of the foundation of the English church with Easter as the most important date in the early mediaeval calendar. ~S " True text
