Exploiting undocumented immigrants, and other workers is cruelty free?Nearly 500,000 children as young as six harvest 25 percent of US crops. But I guess brown people don’t fucking matter.   People are literally starving in South America because all the Quinoa crop is being exported mainly for white vegans who want to live “cruelty-free” but don’t care about brown people as much as they do about animals.  plus, 4 of the 8 most common food allergies (soy, wheat, peanuts, and tree nuts) are common vegan substitutes.  o shit  i would literally starve to death if i couldn’t eat cheese or meats because my body cannot process nuts as they are too rough on my intestines and cause inflammation  Plus there are vegan articles floating around decrying the use of honey, even though the production and harvest of honey by responsible beekeepers doesn’t hurt the bees at all and is not exploitative, and that misinformation hurts the honey industry, which is TRYING TO SAVE BEES FROM EXTINCTION.  !  Seeing as many vegans don’t think (or don’t care) about the human cruelty aspects of veganism, I’ll add that many animals are killed and habitats destroyed to produce arable crops. Rabbits are regularly shot and killed to protect crops. If a farmer has a particularly bad rabbit problem i.e. a large, established warren, they may use a gas bomb like the Rodenator to destroy the warren and kill or relocate the rabbits. Also works well to kill rats and moles. Harvesting crops kills or destroys the homes of many small animals like mice. Even organic farming uses pesticides to kill insects. Poison is used to protect stored food such as grains from rats and mice.Pest control is essential for food production. Without it farmers worldwide simply would not be able to meet the demand for food. It is literally impossible to live cruelty free in modern western society. Animals have been used as resources, exterminated as pests, and harmed indirectly by humans for millenia. Humans have exploited each other probably since before we were recognisable as humans. There’s also the environmental footprint of producing and importing food. All we can do is reduce harm. Being vegan does not mean you are living a cruelty free life.  I’m surprised nobody’s brought up palm oil yet. Thousands of orangutans a year are displaced or outright killed to make room for commercial palm oil farming. Palm oil is one of the most commonly used vegan cooking fats. " False text

At home, when no one was watching, she would stash the money inside tampon applicators in her bathroom where she hoped her abusive husband would never look. Each time she collected $100, she took those bills to a bank in the next town and exchanged it for $100 bill so the money would be easier to hide. After two years, she saved the $2,600 needed to hire an attorney and file for divorce. “That was the longest two years of my life,” says Lori. “I lived in fear that he would kill me.” Her instincts were right. After Lori filed for a divorce, her husband showed up at their shared home with a gun and plans to kill her, their six children, and then himself. Lori and the children weren’t home and, because of his actions, Lori was able to get an emergency personal protection order keeping her soon-to-be ex-husband away from her, her children, and their home. That was almost 13 years ago. After leaving her husband, Lori worked two jobs, as a secretary and waitress, and eventually went back to school, earning a master’s degree in social work from the University of Michigan. Lori, now 51, was a victim of financial abuse. She had no access to her family’s bank account or credit cards, her husband forbid her to work outside the home, and when she wanted to spend money, she needed to ask his permission. Lori tried to leave him several times, but she always went back because she couldn’t provide for herself and her six children independently. Her story isn’t unusual. One in four U.S. women will experience domestic violence in her lifetime, according to the Center for Disease Control, and 99 percent of those victims will also experience financial abuse, according to the Center for Financial Security. “Many people don’t recognize financial abuse right away, in part, because of historic gender roles,” says Sarah Gonzalez Bocinski, director of the Institute for Women’s Policy Research’s Economic Security for Survivors Project. According to Bocinski, there are relatively clear ways to identify victims of abuse.  “These are very planned, deliberate acts that abusers do to limit victims and prevent them from breaking free,” says Bocinski. One of the most common ways abusers control their victims is to build up debt in their name, without telling them, she says, because once you have large amounts of debt in your name or a low credit score, it can be difficult to rent an apartment and, in some cases, even get a job. The ramifications of excessive debt and a low credit score can last longer than the effects of physical violence, says Dr. Judy Postmus, associate professor director of the Center on Violence Against Women and Children at Rutgers University. If your spouse knows your social security number and your mother’s maiden name, they can easily open up credit cards, a line of credit, or even a business in your name without you knowing about it. “If someone is racking up debt in your name, when you get a divorce that debt is split 50-50,” she says. This is true even if you don’t know about the debt. Leaving an abusive relationship is a real challenge for victims of financial abuse, says Katie Ray-Jones, CEO of the National Domestic Violence Hotline. When a woman reports financial abuse, it’s difficult to get the police involved, she says. There is no way for the victim to prove she didn’t open that credit card, or that isn’t her signature, or that her spouse wiped out the bank account. And, because there aren’t any laws that focus on preventing financial abuse of an intimate partner, the topic hasn’t gained the attention of researchers, says Postmus. Most of what is known about financial abuse comes from survivor’s stories, not from large-scale national research, she adds. Ray-Jones adds that many abuse victims report that their partners feel threatened and become more abusive when the victim begins to earn more money or gets promoted at work. In fact, victims have told her about opening a separate bank account when they get a raise and asking their employer to divert that money to a secret account. Victims have also asked their boss not to give them a raise. But there is no national research to show how widespread these tactics are or whether the violence increases as the victim gains more economic independence. Several studies offer anecdotal evidence that abuse may increase as victims try to improve their economic status or employment prospects. For instance, a June 2016 study by Partners for a Competitive Workforce finds that intimidation and intimate partner violence can discourage enrollment and participation in education and training programs. Similarly, a National Resource Center on Domestic Violence study found that domestic violence typically escalates when a survivor enrolls in education or training.  However, Postmus says another theory is the abuse may decrease as the victim’s income goes up because the partner doesn’t want to lose the extra income. “The problem is we just don’t know,” she says. “We often hear from women that finances are a way for partners to control, manipulate, coerce, and intimidate them,” says Ray-Jones. “A lot of women don’t leave the relationship because they fear being able to financially take care of their children.” Both Postmus and Ray-Jones credit The Allstate Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Allstate Insurance Company, with bringing awareness to financial abuse 10 years ago with its Purple Purse program, aimed at helping financial abuse and domestic violence victims. A cornerstone of the program is an online financial curriculum,Moving Ahead Through Financial Management, which was developed specifically to help financial abuse victims leave their abusers, get out of debt, and restore their credit rating. To date, about 800,000 people have completed the course, which is available in English and Spanish. In 2014, Allstate asked Rutgers University to conduct a study of 457 survivors who had completed the curriculum to validate the program was helping survivors, says Vicky Dinges, Allstate senior vice president of corporate relations. After completing the course, 90 percent learned to create a budget and 72 percent understood how to improve their credit rating, compared to 20 percent precurriculum. There was also an 18 percent increase in the number of survivors using a bank account after completing the course. “It was important for us to know the curriculum was valuable for survivors,” Dinges says. “We wanted to work on a solution, not just put a Band-Aid on the problem.” The course encourages victims to take small steps towards leaving their abuser: Postmus and Ray-Jones both agree more needs to be done to study the long-terms effects of financial abuse. For now, Ray-Jones says her organization shares anecdotal evidence with Congress, but that hasn’t been sufficient to get Congress to create laws against the financial abuse of an intimate partner.   Ideally, says Postmus, there should be a law that protects intimate partners from financial abuse. Last year, England changed its domestic violence and abuse law to recognize financial abuse, she says. Abusers in the United States should be held responsible for causing someone to jeopardize their financial status, says Postmus. As of now, one in four women is still a victim of intimate partner violence, which is more than the number of women diagnosed with breast, ovarian, and lung cancer combined.

Oh, did you mean humans? Oh ok then. You can be male because you were born female, but you have 5-alphareductase deficiency and so you grew a penis at age 12. You can be female because you have an X and a Y chromosome but you are insensitive to androgens, and so you have a female body. You can be female because you have an X and a Y chromosome but your Y is missing the SRY gene, and so you have a female body. You can be male because you have two X chromosomes, but one of your X’s HAS an SRY gene, and so you have a male body. You can be male because you have two X chromosomes- but also a Y. You can be female because you have only one X chromosome at all. And you can be male because you have two X chromosomes, but your heart and brain are male. And vice - effing - versa.

Far from “saving lives,” as most animal rights groups falsely claim, the conventional focus on consumer action may very well be ensuring our movement’s irrelevance. What’s the alternative? To recognize that the boycott is just one among many tactics. To push the boundaries of political imagination to find more inspiring models of action: protest, storytelling, norm formation (such as the Liberation Pledge), and, yes, direct rescue and liberation. To create agents of change, to connect them into empowered communities and networks, and to inspire those networks to take powerful political – not consumer, but political – action for animals. At root, the intuition is quite simple. The boycott is simply “not doing something.” But what this movement needs – what the animals need – is not a movement of “do nothings” but “do somethings.” So let’s go out and do something for animals.

Yet bizarrely, the Democratic party - out of power across the country and increasingly irrelevant - still refuses to embrace him and his message. It’s increasingly clear they do so at their own peril. A new Fox News poll out this week shows Sanders has a +28 net favorability rating among the US population, dwarfing all other elected politicians on both ends of the political spectrum. And he’s even more popular among the vaunted “independents,” where he is at a mind boggling +41. This poll is not just an aberration. Look at this Huffington Post chart that has tracked Sanders’s favorability rating over time, ever since he gained national prominence in 2015 when he started running for the Democratic nomination. The more people got to know him, they more they liked him - the exact opposite of what his critics said would happen when he was running against Clinton. One would think with numbers like that, Democratic politicians would be falling all over themselves to be associated with Sanders, especially considering the party as a whole is more unpopular than the Republicans and even Donald Trump right now. Yet instead of embracing his message, the establishment wing of the party continues to resist him at almost every turn, and they seem insistent that they don’t have to change their ways to gain back the support of huge swaths of the country. Politico ran a story just this week featuring Democratic officials fretting over the fact that Sanders supporters may upend their efforts to retake governorships in Southern states by insisting those candidates adopt Sanders’ populist policies - seemingly oblivious to the fact that Sanders plays well in some of those states too. Sanders’s effect on Trump voters can be seen in a gripping town hall this week that MSNBC’s Chris Hayes hosted with him in West Virginia - often referred to as “Trump Country” - where the crowd ended up giving him a rousing ovation after he talked about healthcare being a right of all people and that we are the only industrialized nation in the world who doesn’t provide health care as a right to all its people. (Continue Reading)  Well, I mean, the fact that he joined the party, ran a destabilizing primary campaign that hurt their eventual candidate because he was unwilling to actually accede to basic norms like shutting the fuck up and endorsing the winner, and then immediately left the party again probably didn’t make him many friends in the party establishment. I don’t say any of this as a knock against Sanders, whose politics I continue to like more than Democrats and considerably less than actual socialism, but you really don’t have to scratch your head for answers on why the party isn’t embracing someone whose dealings with them basically consist of shouting “I’m going to throw you under the bus the moment it’s convenient for me” over and over again.  Which has been my response this whole time. Shocker, Democratic Party doesn’t like a guy who isn’t a Democrat. Of course my additional response is to then note that if you don’t like it actually join the party. Now is probably a great time to do so if you want to steer it more left/liberal. Like, party membership costs practically nothing in the US: just have to check a box on voter registration form. Full transformation requires more involvement obviously, but that at least allows you to vote in the primaries (tis why honestly I favor closed primaries). Granted, I honestly still don’t buy the idea he’d have beaten Trump.Trump and Bernie both share populist economic appeal, but Trump offered ethnic nationalism too and we all know how that goes in the US. And Bernie gets the glow of “what could have been” too. But I think the fact he couldn’t even win the primary elections and did well mostly in caucuses (most inaccessible form of primaries) should be a big sign maybe he didn’t have the appeal his supporters thought.  A Parties whole purpose is to win elections. This is something we must remember when we analyze these responses. Now, if the most popular politician in America with a voter database the party is trying to get ahold of is willing to work with you, you might want to find a way to make the party endearing to him and his supporters. The issue is by alienating Bernie Sanders, the Democratic Party is alienating his supporters as well, supporters that will be needed to to win future elections.If a parties whole purpose is to get people elected, this is a very dumb strategy to accomplish that. - @theliberaltony" False link

As the nation’s supply dries up, trans people who rely on injectable estrogen are panicking. “Members of the community are not finding out” about the shortage, Salcedo told me. “I don’t think many service providers even know about it. I still have not received notice from a doctor.” In fact, if it weren’t for an acquaintance who works at the clinic she goes to, Salcedo, who founded the Los Angeles-based TransLatin@ Coalition in 2009 to advocate for the needs of trans Latinx immigrants in the U.S., might still be in the dark about the status of her medication, which she described as “life-saving.” Synthetic estrogen plays a crucial role for trans women and transfeminine people who choose to undergo hormone replacement therapy as a means of medically transitioning. Yet the growing disappearance of its injectable form from the pharmaceutical market has gone largely unnoticed beyond the circles of those affected. Salcedo said that she has “not seen any” media coverage of the shortage, despite the subject’s constant presence on her various social media feeds. That’s not surprising. In the eight weeks since Out magazine’s website broke the news of the “Injectable Estrogen Shortage That’s Leaving Trans Women in Crisis,” very few outlets have picked up the story. This silence, Salcedo told me, must be broken. “They would not deny a person who is diabetic their medication, right?” she asked. “Access to hormones saves lives. Not having this medication puts us in danger.”  This is critically important. Hormone access can literally be a matter of life and death; we have to keep talking about this.   Wait,  WHAT?
