He then described joining the FBI in raids in India, Russia, Mexico and stateside in New Jersey and New York. “I’ve seen things that no person should ever see,” he said, tearing  up. “I’ve seen video content of a child that is the same age as mine  being raped by an American man that was a sex tourist in Cambodia.

Now, if I  got that phone call, the answer would be yes.” He then recalled the story of “Amy,” a 15-year-old girl from Oakland,  Calif., who was forced into trafficking within hours of meeting a man  in person she’d first talked to online. “This isn’t an isolated  incident. There’s not much that’s unusual about it,” Kutcher said. “The  only unusual thing is that ‘Amy’ was found and returned to her family  within three days using a tool we created … called Spotlight.” Kutcher said the tool aids police in cutting investigation time by 60  percent, adding, “That’s my day job and I’m sticking to it.” It wasn’t all heavy: Kutcher and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) had a lighthearted moment after his speech. “You were better looking in the movies,” McCain said.

There are ambulances with dying people on that motorway, police officers going to inspect crime scenes or respond to calls for domestic violence, parents that need to pick up their children from school, pet owners that need to go home and feed their pets, people trying to reach a friend or a family member that called them saying “i’m feeling suicidal and don’t want to be alone right now.” And these types of protests can last hours, days…  And that IS a problem.

There are lives on the line when you block off major highways. people can die, and have.   Wording it in a way where you are criminalizing simple peaceful protestors is misleading. Obstruction of traffic is a crime, for a reason! You need to read this article carefully before coming to inaccurate conclusions. For example, here i have emphasised the key points from the article that can be easily looked over[note: three of them are in superscripts]: In North Dakota, for instance, Republicans introduced a bill last week that would allow motorists to run over and kill any protester obstructing a highway as long as a driver does so accidentally. In Minnesota, a bill introduced by Republicans last week seeks to dramatically stiffen fines for freeway protests and would allow prosecutors to seek a full year of jail time for protesters blocking a highway. Republicans in Washington state have proposed a plan to reclassify as a felony civil disobedience protests that are deemed “economic terrorism.”¹ Republicans in Michigan introduced and then last month shelved an anti-picketing law that would increase penalties against protestors and would make it easier for businesses to sue individual protestors for their actions². And in Iowa a Republican lawmaker has pledged to introduce legislation to crack down on highway protests.³  ¹ economic terrorism is blocking off access to local businesses during the protests. Say someone needs to pick up a prescription for a heart condition - but they can’t because there are 500 people shouting angrily in front of their pharmacy and they can’t get through. Say a protest started during your shift and now you can’t reach your kid and get home to make supper for your children. Or what if you run a small business and you are struggling because the economy is shit but customers cannot reach your store.While this may not be the aim of a protest, it is a common consequence of it and people should be held responsible for it. ² See ‘economic terrorism’ ³ See my initial point They aren’t making protesting illegal, they are trying to make it safer " False link

But then came Vantablack. Earlier this year, Kapoor sparked outrage from artists all over the world with the announcement that he had made a deal to become the only person in the world allowed to use the blackest pigment of black paint ever developed. Known as Vantablack, the unique carbon nanotube-based pigment is produced solely by a British company called NanoSystem, and was originally developed for military technologies. However, Kapoor made an agreement with the company that he is the only person allowed to use it for artistic purposes. Needless to say, that made plenty of other artists furious. “When I first heard that Anish had the exclusive rights to the blackest black I was really disappointed,” artist Stuart Semple tells Kevin Holmes for The Creators Project. “I was desperate to have a play with it in my own work and I knew lots of other artists who wanted to use it too. It just seemed really mean-spirited and against the spirit of generosity that most artists who make and share their work are driven by.” Like Kapoor, Semple’s work often uses vivid shades of color, and for years he had worked with scientists to develop increasingly intense pigments to use in his artwork. So as a response to Kapoor’s exclusive deal with Vantablack, Semple decided to release his own special pigment, known simply as “Pink,” the Irish Examiner reports.  While “Pink” isn’t based on nanotechnology, like Vantablack, Semple says it is the pinkest pink pigment ever created. Now, in an effort to thumb his nose at Kapoor, Semple is making it for sale to everyone in the world—except Kapoor, Tom Power reports for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation’s Q. i am living have you ever been this petty    😂😂😂  i am sobbing  By adding this product to your cart you confirm that you are not Anish Kapoor, you are in no way affiliated to Anish Kapoor, you are not purchasing this item on behalf of Anish Kapoor or an associate of Anish Kapoor.

After two straight critical misses with X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine, the series really needed to get back on track, and Matthew Vaughn’s film did just that. As great  as it is, however, it could have been even cooler had initial plans  worked out – as budget cuts cost the blockbuster a couple of incredibly  cool psychic battles between telepathic mutants Charles Xavier (James  McAvoy) and Emma Frost (January Jones). I learned the details of these never-made action sequences while recently interviewing screenwriter Ashley Miller as part of promotion for the new Austin Film Festival-published book On Story - Screenwriters & Filmmakers On Their Iconic Films. While talking about his work on X-Men: First Class  - which was co-written by Zack Stentz, Jane Goldman, and Matthew Vaughn  – Miller mentioned that the film didn’t have a director when he signed  on, so I asked him if that provided a bit of freedom to really make the  X-Men movie he wanted to see. While the screenwriter noted  that the finished film is “mind-boggling close to the movie that was  made,” there was a particularly sequence that didn’t happen because it  would have been too expensive: There was stuff that we were playing with where we would have a  couple of telepathic battles between Emma Frost and Charles. The whole  idea of them was that Charles was learning how to use his powers, number  one, and number two, that there were threats even in the safety of his  own mind. Continuing, Ashley Miller went on to describe the two psychic battles that X-Men: First Class  was going to feature. While facing off mentally against the telepathic  Emma Frost, Xavier was going to construct his own version of the mansion  in which he grew up – but the villainous member of the Hellfire Club  was going to use it to turn the tables on him. Said Miller, The first sequence was really first putting him in a vision where he  thinks he’s safe, but is really horrible. There was one sequence that  takes place entirely in what’s to become the X-Mansion, and Emma Frost  just destroys it and nearly him. And she says, ‘You hid in the place  where you are most vulnerable. You’re showing me everything.’ Similarly, the second psychic battle was going to take Xavier to another familiar place: Cerebro: It all led up to a fight inside a space that Xavier had created in  his own mind that looked very much like Cerebro, as we understand it  now. It was cool, and it was in the context of him interrogating her and  Magneto after they captured her. There was cool stuff like that, but  difficult to realize. Fox apparently didn’t have the confidence required at the time to let the production of X-Men: First Class  create a psychic battle, but we did get to finally see a big screen  version of the comic book combat when Xavier went toe-to-toe with the  titular villain in X-Men: Apocalypse (which also featured some time in the X-Mansion going poorly)… To learn more about Ashley Miller’s time working on X-Men: First Class, pick up a copy of On Story - Screenwriters & Filmmakers On Their Iconic Films, which is now available for purchase – and, as always, be sure to stay tuned for more about the future of the X-Men franchise.

The company dubbed it “The Nuisance Committee,”  named after Cards Against Humanity co-creator Max Temkin’s grandfather  Ira Weinstein’s experience during WWII. While interned in a POW camp in  Germany, Weinstein formed with other prisoners the “Nuisance Committee,”  designed to irritate their captors. A press release announcing the  super PAC’s formation writes, “The comparison here between Trump and  Hitler is intentional.”   “If your opponent is going to be spending tons of money and using all of  these legal tools to outflank you, to say that we’re going to stand on  principle and we’re not going to spend any money, and we’re not going to  fight back, and we’re not going to advocate for our values using all  the tools that the system provides, then how much can you really care  about the cause? I feel so strongly about Trump that I will use whatever  tools are legally available to try to stop him. Unfortunately, where we  are in American democracy right now, that includes all these things  that nobody likes.”     oh my god  chaotic good " False link
