Switzerland, Sonogno.  Starting point is here.  I lost the way in the very beginning and I had to¬†cross the river ford.  I felt like I am inside a computer game and surroundings were created by a designer.  The route runs along the river.    Interesting detail about those small houses is a super heavy duty roof made out of a thick rock.             With two elegant arches the photogenic Roman inspired bridge (which is however not Roman) spans the river. And here it is clear where the name Verzasca - ‚Äúgreen water‚Äù ‚Äì comes from. The bridge has by now become a landmark for the whole valley.      Lavertezzo.  21.05.2016" True text
