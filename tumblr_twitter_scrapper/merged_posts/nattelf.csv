You’re suffering, but you have the courage to seek out ideas on how to take care of yourself. I’m guessing you haven’t come across many tips like these. When I was being abused, the only advice I found was about how to leave an abusive partner, or how to heal after you’ve left.  In this society we sometimes talk about abuse victims being strong after they leave, but frame them as weak before hand. I think that is so wrong. Living in an abusive relationship takes a strength that most people cannot even comprehend. you’re not weak because you stay. there are a million reasons why we stay because, frankly, abusers actively work to keep their victims trapped.  So know that if you’re in an abusive relationship right now as you read this, I think you are strong as fuck, and I am rooting hard as hell for you.   Honestly, if people feel even a little inclined to reblog this, I would appreciate it. I am not trying to guilt anyone, if you don’t reblog I won’t think you’re a horrible person, that’s totally your prerogative… But if these words can help even just one current victim of domestic violence… I would be so happy.   So many people can’t leave. So many. Please be safe.  SIGNAL BOOST  For anyone who needs it " False link
