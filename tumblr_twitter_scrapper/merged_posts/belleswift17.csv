She has learned from the past.” Jetting in under the radar and reportedly renting a house in North London, Swift is determined to keep her relationship out of the spotlight — and so is Alwyn. The Grammy winner, 27, was first spotted publicly hanging out with Alwyn, 26, after a Kings of Leon concert last October with a group of girlfriends, including Martha Hunt and Lorde. One month later, she caught a showing of his film Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk in L.A. with the Haim sisters and her mom Andrea. “Joe’s a very normal, down-to-earth guy,” says another insider of the rising star, who just wrapped his film The Favourite. “He’s private and low-key.” And though the relationship is now public, “they’re on the same page on how to handle the attention,” adds the insider."

The actor, who is one of Hollywood’s rising stars, is keen to spend more time with Taylor, 27, in her homeland as their shock relationship turns even more serious. Joe, 26, also hopes an increased presence in the US will help him land future film roles. A source said: “Joe really wants to be near Taylor and moving to the US will mean they can spend much more time together. “He’s a real family man and is close to his parents, so he will still be a regular visitor to their London home. “That means Taylor will still be able to continue her love affair with London where she can walk around unnoticed and live a relatively normal life.” The Sun revealed last week global superstar Taylor was secretly dating the British star. She had been making frequent visits to a rented North London property over the past few months to see the young actor. " False link

Edited by Nashville-based journalist, songwriter, producer and publicist Holly Gleason and subtitled How The Women In Country Music Changed Our Lives, the University of Texas Press book will examine the relationship between female songwriters and the women of an older country music generation who inspired them. The highly personal essays will include Swift’s assessment of the 1950s pop hitmaker turned country matriarch Brenda Lee, titled Rare Peer. Rosanne Cash writes about her father Johnny’s second wife June in a piece entitled Eulogy For A Mother. Up-and-coming country artist Aubrie Sellers, herself from fine Nashville tradition as the daughter of Lee Ann Womack, writes about one of her greatest artistic influences, Alison Krauss (Draw Your Own Map).  Grace Potter, frontwoman of rock band the Nocturnals but also guest vocalist on Kenny Chesney’s major country hits ‘You and Tequila’ and ‘Wild Child,’ contributes Canciones di Corazon Salvage, a piece about one of her heroines, Linda Ronstadt. Other writers will include Alice Randall, Holly George-Warren, Wendy Pearl, and Cynthia Sanz. “Woman Walk the Line came about because it feels like we’re not just in danger of losing the story of so many incredible artists, especially the women, but that deeper sense of what music can truly to mean to someone in their life,” says Gleason. “The way this music and these women are written about says so much about the way music marks our lives, shapes our journey or keeps us safe in rugged times. It’s women of varying ages all writing about how music touched and changed their lives — part witness, part love letter, a bit of music criticism, a little history and a whole lot of heart. “It’s more than what they wore or who they dated, as today’s reductionist media makes it. And that’s where the marrow of these essays begins.”    Update: There is also an essay about Taylor! pictured is Brenda Lee - Taylor wrote an essay about her for this book. " False link

The 1989 singer has left a blank space in the public eye in recent months, rarely sharing posts to Instagram and largely avoiding public events.Her mysteriously low profile has led many fans to wonder what she’s been up to since her last public performance on Feb. 4, during a pre-Super Bowl concert in Houston, Texas Well, fans need not wonder any longer – and should start getting excited! A source tells ET that Swift “has been busy working on her upcoming album.”According to the source, the “Shake It Off” singer has been figuring out what the sound and feel of her new album is going to be, and whether or not she wants to continue in the pop genre that propelled her last album to record-shattering success, or return to her beloved country roots.However, the source did note that Swift’s next big album is expected to drop by the end of the year.Swift has stayed off the radar in a big way while working on creating her new music. While typically ubiquitous on social media, the 27-year-old songstresshas only posted to Instagram once in the last two months, and that was to promote the release of her friend and fellow pop diva Lorde’s latest single, “Green Light.”While keeping out of the spotlight, ET’s source says Swift has been staying closer to home, spending time in Nashville, Tennessee, where the singer was recently spotted driving around just last week.“She comes here to get away from the paparazzi,” an eyewitness suggested to ET.While the news of Swift’s forthcoming sixth studio album is music to many fans’ ears, the singer’s squad of gal pals apparently knew that she’d returned to the recording studio months ago.Back in September, Swift turned out to support her bestie Gigi Hadid as she walked the runway at the Tommy Hilfiger fashion show in New York City. ET caught up with Hadid at the event, and the model revealed why it was such a treat to see Swift at the event.“She’s obviously such a great friend and you know, she is starting to go back to work in the studio again and really made time to be here for me and I am so grateful for that,” Hadid shared.ET has reached out to Swift’s reps for comment.Swift’s months-long absence really shouldn’t come as much of a surprise, considering the fact that she was very upfront with her decision to not tour or perform throughout 2017 when she played the DirecTV Now Super Saturday Night pre-Super Bowl concert two months ago.“By coming to this show tonight, you are attending 100 percent of this year’s tour dates,” she told the star-studded audience.

In 2016, it claimed the three top singles on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs chart, led by FGL’s “H.O.L.Y.” And as recently as February, programmers attending the 2017 Country Radio Seminar (CRS) voted Big Machine the ­format’s top label. So when word quietly slipped out in early March about the ­shuttering of Dot Records, one of BMLG’s five imprints, on the heels of several longtime executives departing for new gigs (among them: senior vp sales Kelly Rich to Amazon, senior vp partnership ­marketing and ­promotion strategy John Zarling to Sony and senior vp promotion Jack Purcell to ­management ­company EM.Co), Music Row watchers began ­wondering whether BMLG had run into some growing pains after expanding into a major. It’s a question founder/CEO Scott Borchetta, whose renown has grown beyond the industry (the 54-year-old was a mentor for three seasons on American Idol), is happy to tackle head on. “It really started at the 10-year turn – ­knowing that we became this big label by taking chances and saying, ‘Wait a ­minute: We’re ­starting to do a lot of the things that I didn’t like about major labels,’ ” Borchetta tells Billboard. A bloated roster was one of those traits, and BMLG began by ­dropping “probably 12 or 13 ­artists over the last 16 to 17 months,” says Borchetta, along with ­voluntary exits by The Band Perry (to take a shot at pop ­success) and McGraw (who, ­partnered with wife Faith Hill, got a richer deal at Sony).

The affluent town is also home to Ralph Lauren, Bruce Willis, and Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones.(Martha Stewart lives around the corner — and worked closely with the couple when designing their South Carolina wedding.)Choosing to live outside of the paparazzi’s prime territory has made it easier for Lively and Reynolds to enjoy their downtime and stay out of the media spotlight.“They’ve been nesting for quite a while now,” a source previously told PEOPLE. “They moved to the suburbs, which has a pretty conservative lifestyle. They also picked a very traditional kind of house for people who work in Hollywood. They wanted a house with character, not a trendy, modern house. Their place is very homey. [Lively] is very domestic.”Reynolds echoed that in December 2015, telling The Project, “we don’t lead a wild and crazy life.”“We don’t live in L.A., we live on a farm in New York,” PEOPLE’s 2010 Sexiest Man Alive said — adding that when it comes to his own personality, he just not the going-out-all-night, hard-partying kind of star.“I’ve never been the guy stumbling out of bars at three in the morning, at least that anyone is aware of,” Reynolds explained. “It’s never been my thing.”PARENTHOODInstead, Reynolds’ “thing” has been being a dad to 2-year-old daughter James and his newborn daughter, whose name hasn’t been released since she was born in September.“Having a daughter was a dream come true for me,” Reynolds previously told PEOPLE,. “If I could have nine daughters, I would be thrilled. Really, like I genuinely would be.”“I’m just fine being surrounded by estrogen,” he added. “I grew up in a house full of testosterone: I’m the youngest of four boys, and my dad was a cop, and that’s intense. For whatever reason, I always got along great with girls. I don’t have to prepare to be wrapped around my daughter’s finger – it has happened.”“I would not be an unhappy man if I had a six-person soccer team of girls,” he joked.There’s plenty of practice room for the team on Lively and Reynolds’ 2-acre home. Overlooking the Cross River Reservoir, the space is a quiet sanctuary for the family. And both are hoping to expand their tribe.“My wife is the youngest of five; we’d love to have a large family,” Reynolds said.“I’ve always wanted a big family,” Lively previously told PEOPLE. “You don’t just raise your kids, your kids also raise each other – oh my Lord, the things I learned from my brother Eric. He’s influenced my life so much. So I’m looking forward to how one baby influences the other, and to my family as a whole, to every single chapter.”COUPLE TIMEWhile their family has remained a priority, Reynolds and Lively still find time to be together alone — sneaking off for date nights in Paris, supporting one another at film premieres, and always gushing about their love to the press.They first met when they costarred together in 2011’s Green Lantern — but didn’t start dating until a year after the film’s release. “Fireworks were going off between us,” Reynolds told PEOPLE of the moment the two realized romance was a possibility between them.Lively added that she was grateful they had the time to get to know one another on a friendly level first.“We were such good friends for so long and we both got to know each other as friends,” she said. “That’s what I appreciate about our relationship. He really is my friend first and foremost — not just in our history, but in our everyday life first. And I think that’s the secret to my happiness.”In October, the couple celebrated Reynolds’ 40th birthday at Japanese restaurant O Ya in New York City — the place Lively said they “fell in love.”The high-end eatery was decorated with ribbons and photos of the happy couple from moments throughout their relationship. They even snapped a photo while holding a throwback photo from Reynolds’ 35th birthday party – around the time they first started dating.Of course, no appearance has been as sweet yet as when the Reynolds-Lively brood made their first public outing to cheer on Reynolds for his new star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The happy couple posed for photos while holding their two children.It’s good to get out of the ‘burbs now and again." False link

Were you surprised?I was taken aback, in a good way. It taught me that no matter how big you become, it doesn’t mean you have to stop loving music or paying attention.When you got to perform with her on the 1989 tour, did you daydream about headlining stadiums?Absolutely. But half of it is daydreaming and the other half is just complete terror. I’ve never been one to crave attention, which I know means that this is probably the worst career to pick. I get anxious even when people come up to me for pictures, sometimes. That’s the one thing that makes me hesitant about my future. But I love music too much to not do it." False link
belleswift17 158475819764 "2017-03-16 15:09:08 GMT" http://belleswift17.tumblr.com/post/158475819764/taylor-swifts-new-trademarks-what-they-mean-and "it-feels-like-a-perfect-night:   MAR 15, 2017Taylor Swift fans went wild after a TMZ story speculated that Swift was “done fighting with Spotify” and instead launching her own music streaming service. The evidence? One of Swift’s companies, TAS Rights Management, filed a slew of trademarks last month, which was noted by Reddit users several weeks ago. However, despite the filings to use the words “Swiftie” and “Swifties” (the nicknames for Swift’s loyal fans) in several categories, including “a website featuring non-downloadable audio recordings [and] video recordings,” it’s highly unlikely Swift is planning a streaming service of her own anytime soon as TMZ postulates. Why?For starters, Swift already has a very high profile—and presumably very lucrative—streaming partnership with Apple. Another one of her global partners, AT&T, launched a cross-device video streaming experience called Taylor Swift Now last November. It wouldn’t make sense for Swift to compete with these already-established partnerships, and Swift certainly isn’t known for making business missteps. You don’t become the world’s highest-paid celebrity with $170 million in earnings without being an exceptionally smart businesswoman.Savvy celebrities file trademarks all the time for ideas and products that may or may not ever come to fruition. Sometimes it’s done preemptively to keep others from taking ownership of marks that have a strongly perceived tie to the celebrity even though the projects may never see the light of day. For instance, in 2010, Swift filed for permission to use her name on makeup and cosmetics. No such product line was ever developed (although she did lend her name and likeness to CoverGirl around the same time), and the trademark was abandoned in 2014.Swift’s TAS Rights Management currently owns more than 90 active and dead trademarks, including for phrases like “Swiftmas,” “Blank Space” and “A Girl Named Girl.” Swift herself owns several other trademarks, including her name, various iterations of her logo and signature and other trademarks relating to her albums.So, what could the filings mean? Perhaps nothing. Or—much more exciting for Swift fans—perhaps they point to an enhanced version of Swift’s fan club launching in the months ahead. Swift doesn’t currently have a paid fan club, which is unusual for a superstar on her level. Many artists generate hundreds of thousands of dollars of revenue each year from paid membership clubs. Fans, in turn, are granted items like early pre-sale access to concert tickets, exclusive content downloads, annual merch packages and a private forum to communicate.Since “Swifties” is the term Swift’s fans have embraced for years, it seems likely that an official “Swiftie Community” could be in the works to align with Swift’s next album launch. Swift’s next album release has not been announced, but her past releases suggest it will come this September or October. The specific merchandise trademark categories (musical instruments, clothing, stationary), plus the specific mention of online retail store services and content downloads, all seem to support an impending premium fan club, which would likely exist through both a premium app and a web platform. Swift’s official website is run by Wonderful Union, a company well known for managing high-profile artist fan clubs.Regardless of what the recent trademarks may or may not mean, #Swifties can count on lots more carefully crafted marketing from Swift as the year unfolds."

belleswift17 158475750974 "2017-03-16 15:06:28 GMT" http://belleswift17.tumblr.com/post/158475750974/that-taylor-swift-spotify-rival-rumor-explained "it-feels-like-a-perfect-night: MARCH 15, 2017 6:18 PMOn Wednesday, TMZ gave voice to a voiceless Taylor Swift, as is its wont, with a headline that screams, “I’m Done Fighting Spotify, I’m Eyeing My Own Streaming Service.” The story claimed that Swift intends to create her own streaming service to compete with Spotify based on a trademark application filed for the word “Swifties.” The site points to the inclusion of “non-downloadable multi-media content in the nature of audio recordings” in the application as proof.But with no official announcement from Swift’s camp about what this means, it’s hard to read through the legalese to know exactly what to expect. That’s where Martin Schwimmer, trademark lawyer at Leason Ellis and the man behind the Trademark Blog, comes in.The first red flag? The filing could be entirely about a Swift Web site already in existence that uses the word “Swiftie” and plays her music. As Schwimmer points out, the line that TMZ focused on—“featuring non-downloadable multi-media content in the nature of audio recordings”—cites its “first use” as October 2014.Second, there’s the number of categories that TAS Rights Management, Swift’s trademark lawyers, filed to—nine total—from musical instruments to online retail stores to bags to notebooks to educational resources. All of these could be “Swiftie,” streaming service or no.News stories about trademark applications often bubble up around Swift and other business-minded celebrities like Beyoncé, Kylie Jenner, and Kanye West) because it’s public information that’s easily searchable at the United States Patent and Trademark Office. They’re rarely good for predicting what a celebrity will do since it’s just a good strategy—if you have the money—to mark your space in a bunch of different categories, just in case.At the end of 2015, for example, Swift’s lawyers moved to trademark “Swiftmas,” “Blank Space,” “And I’ll Write Your Name,” “A Girl Named Girl,” and “1989.” Though several of these appear to still be pending, Swift owns “this sick beat” as it applies to 16 categories, and “cause we never go out of style” in two, and “Nice to meet you. ’ve you been?” in three. Swift’s team of lawyers also successfully litigated in China against trademark infringement the same year, and Etsy sellers using Swift’s trademarked lyrics are frequent recipients of cease-and-desist letters.But if the filing that you may or may not use is likely to go public and possibly get misconstrued, why trademark at all? “She needs that registration for enhanced policing,” explained Schwimmer. “And there’s another thing, which is: you need registrations to get intermediaries to pay attention to you. So if you go to Amazon and want to take down stuff; you go to a domain name company or eBay, and you want them to take down the infringing stuff, [the companies] don’t want to have to evaluate whether you are the real whatever. The easiest thing is to say, ‘Here is my trademark registration.’ ”Then again, the last time a celebrity trademark filing got the Internet worked up, Beyoncé and Jay Z ended up losing the bid to trademark the name of their daughter, Blue Ivy (it was already taken by a Boston-based wedding planner).Vanity Fair has reached out to Swift’s representative for comment."
