The American Foundation of Suicide Prevention has specific guidelines on how to safely portray suicide without inadvertently causing more deaths, and the series blatantly disregards those guidelines in graphically showing Hannah slitting her wrists. This could literally result in more deaths by suicide, which is NOT OKAY. 2. It glorifies suicide by making it seem like killing oneself and leaving tapes/a note/etc is the only way to effectively send a message to the world, when in fact, the opposite is true – the most effective way to send a message is to survive, thrive and tell one’s story.  3. It simplifies suicide by making it seem like it is a direct result of bullying, sexual assault, etc. when in reality the issue is far more complex. 4. It conveys other characters as unhelpful and unsupportive when Hannah tries to reach out, which could discourage viewers from seeking help themselves.  5. It does not effectively address the subject of mental illness, which is a major component in the issue of suicide. 6. Hannah essentially blames others for her death, when in reality suicide is a choice made by those who commit it. Yes, things such as bullying and sexual assault can be a main factor in suicidal ideation and mental illness, but the decision to commit suicide is solely in the hands of the individual. 7. One of the characters justifies her self harm by saying “it’s what you do instead of killing yourself”, which simplifies and glorifies self harm by making it seem like a good “compromise” instead of suicide. 8. The show provides no resources for those struggling with similar issues to Hannah, which again goes against the specific guidelines of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. It is not that hard to do research and find these guidelines, so it is clear that the creators of the show had little to no interest in taking advice from professionals or considering the potential negative impact they could have, which is honestly just disgusting. 9. The school counselor Hannah speaks to brushes off the clear signs of her being a suicide risk, which is literally against the law and not something any qualified professional would do. 10. It is highly offensive to many people struggling with mental illness and suicidal ideation because it never really delves into Hannah’s character, or portrays her as having mental illness (a major factor in most suicides) - it just makes her seem dramatic and attention-seeking, which perpetuates stereotypes. 11. It does not offer a healthy solution or way of coping with traumas such as bullying and assault - the only “solution” it offers is suicide, which, as mentioned previously, the show glamorizes and simplifies. 12. Hannah makes other people like Clay feel irreparably guilty for her death, which is cruel and inconsiderate, and not something most people who commit suicide would actually do. The show treats suicide as “the perfect revenge”, when in reality suicide is about feeling hopeless and sad and is a very personal decision. 13. As someone who has personally attempted suicide and knows the stories of countless others who have, I do not feel that the show accurately and fairly portrays the issue, or adequately addresses the main factors in suicide. To me and many others I have spoken to, it is downright offensive, lacking in research, and overall poorly done.  And that’s all I have to say about that. " False text

It’s our tradition and it’s just as normal as East Asians using chopsticks. Also if you think the hand is gross or not clean enough for us to pick our food but you think it’s clean enough for you to hold your pizza, burger then just letting you know you are fuckin hypocrite lol  lowkey don’t like how ppl are tagging this as unsanitary  I eat curry and rice with my hands and let me tell you…it’s a sacred technique  Americans eat food with our fingers all the fucking time. It’s ridiculous to call it unsanitary… unless your hands are dirty.   Guys it’s not rocket science You just eat the foodWith your hand?  Are your hands clean?Then you’re fine.  it’s highkey racist tagging this as unsanitary.   everyone who tagged this with #unsanitary is a fuckin racist and is no longer ever allowed to eat anything with their bare hands ever again  There is a technique to eating with our fingers that white people don’t know. The way Westerners eat with their hands is downright unsanitary and it has nothing to do with how we do it. There is an entire etiquette laid down in Buddhist writings on the proper and sanitary way to eat with our fingers and it is so delicate and refined that it makes most people who stab away with their cutlery look gross in comparison. We scrub our hands thoroughly before we eat.  We only use our right hand for eating (unless you’re a leftie) and then the food can only come up to the inside of the second knuckle and the fingers do not touch the tongue or inside of the mouth.  The left hand never touches the food if you are eating a rice-based dish and if you are eating bread, the left is only used to help tear and never touches the plate.  You’re supposed to push the food into the mouth with your thumb.  Food does not touch the palm.  Your cheeks are not supposed to bulge when eating.  Food is not supposed to spill or smear anywhere.  It is also considered gross to lick your fingers. Saliva does not make contact with one’s hands at any point.  Unless you’ve spent years learning, you won’t be able to do this properly. Conversely, I only started using cutlery to eat when I was 14 and picked it up fine.  Most South Asians find cutlery somewhat off-putting because they’ve been in other people’s mouths and we don’t know how clean they are, especially at restaurants. And yet we adapt and don’t go around calling other people’s ways of life unsanitary and barbaric.  Don’t be ignorant and supremacist, please.   Note: the bit about licking your fingers does not apply to Muslim South Asians. We’re encouraged to do so because it follows the example of the Prophet and also because it reduces food waste. But only after we’re done eating, and then there’s a specific order (pinkie to thumb).   Everything else @pornyplothead said is accurate. Y'all don’t know jack shit about South Asian mealtime etiquette.  Thanks @amethystinia. I stand corrected. There are also such variations among the many, many South Asian cultures and they all have specific dictates concerning hygiene and consuming food without mess or waste. Our cultures are extremely old and our traditions have kept us hale and hearty all that time. Respect them." False text

From filter phrases to adverbs all over the place, drafts that aren’t scrutinized to condense the writing are often full of words that unnecessarily clog up the writing. Good news is while this is totally not something you should worry about while first drafting (seriously), when the time comes to take care of this issue, it’s relatively easy to do. Time-consuming and painstaking, yes, but thankfully not too difficult to do. To make it even easier, however, I’ve decided to add to my how to make cuts without losing anything useful post with more easy-to-remove words to look out for.  Starts/begins to. This is actually a tip I picked up from my editor, and it’s a good one—9/10 times when you preface an action with “starts to” or “begins to” you don’t need that phrase. Just by describing the action, the readers assume it’s just started unless otherwise stated.   Immediately/without warning. Like “suddenly” these words are usually unnecessary. I’ll refer you to the other post for a longer explanation.   That. I’m not going to say you never need “that”, but oftentimes I find “that” is super overused. In sentences like “She said that I should go,” for example, removing the “that” improves the flow and we don’t lose anything by cutting it.   Up/Down. For these two I only mean in very specific cases: sitting up/down, standing up/down, etc. In those cases, the up/down is unnecessary.   Dialogue + action tag. I see this a lot, and tend to do this a lot when first drafting and just slapping words down, but when you have a dialogue tag and an action tag, you usually only need one—and oftentimes I go with the action tag because it’s more visual (although there are exceptions, of course). So, for example: “‘Where’ve you been?’ he said, scowling” could be condensed to “'Where’ve you been?’ He scowled.”   -ly adverbs. One of my last condensing steps is to go through and do a search for “ly” to cut down on my adverbs. While I definitely don’t recommend removing all of them (adverbs can be useful!), writers in general tend to use them more than necessary, so it can be good to go through and do a quick sweep.  So those are some words I look out for when condensing my writing—what phrases or words would you add to the list?  Words I overuse: Just. Even. Enough. Breathing (huffed, sighed, gasped, breathed). Eye movement (looked, stared, gazed, glanced). " False link

My blackness and fatness and proximity to girlhood was always othered in a way that most others did not experience.  " False link

They’re saying, ‘Oh, we have to honor the biology’ … that is not in tune to what really happens in the hospital.” And there’s no rule in Arkansas that people who give birth even have to name a second parent. Robertson said she frequently sees birth certificates that, for whatever reason, only have the mother’s name. “We have [that] all the time,” Robertson said. “That’s why I call BS on this decision.”  Non-biological parents can still appear on their child’s birth certificate, but they have to go through a second-parent adoption, a costly and time-consuming measure that different-sex parents don’t have to face.  It’s 2016. And yet.  " False link
