Lets talk about what libraries do and why they are important af: - Encourage literacy in children. My library and most other libraries have huge sections entirely for children as well as a ton of programs to encourage children to use the library. I would probably not have the same love for reading that I do today, if not for the amazing library near my house. -Builds communities. My library and most other libraries will frequently sponsor community events to bring people together and make their city a more friendly place. Some of the things my library does it: organise a marathon; participate in parades; two used book sales each year; host local documentary showings; etc. -free books and resources for anyone to use. I can read any book I want for free!!!! It’s awesome. And anyone can do it. -seriously, I see homeless people at my library all the time reading books, and enjoying the free resources. Without the library, they would not have access to those books. -awesome study spot. Seriously, great. As someone who lives with a very large, loud, busy family, the library is awesome for providing a productive peaceful place to study and get away from my hectic house. -Librarians. are. the. greatest. Really, these people are so nice, and cute, and so hard-working, and I just love and want to be friends with them all, because they are awesome.  -What are you gonna do when you need help with your English paper, and the internet isn’t working? Google it? @bklynlibrary, you were the one who started the post, do you have anything to add to this?  Spot on points! We’d like to add that the library is more than just books and literacy! We offer programs and resources for: Immigrants studying for the citizenship exam, trying to find jobs, and looking for English conversation groups. Those who are incarcerated – we bring books to them but also allow incarcerated parents to read to their kids via a live video feed. Amazing cultural events that feature everyone from Pulitzer-prize winning authors to flamenco groups to art critics to teenage metal bands. Job-seekers who need one-on-one resume help and interview prep. Senior citizens who want to stay active – we have dance classes, a bowling league, and all kinds of activities. For artists, we offer free Photoshop, Illustrator, photography, and art classes taught by professionals. Every summer we provide free lunches to kids in low-income families. All kinds of language classes for those looking to learn, and of course, all classes are free! So yeah, the library is pretty bad ass.  YES to all of the above. " False text

In 2000, Wilson left acting and focused on writing. She talks with Martin about her new book, Where Am I Now?  YAY MARA!!!" False link
