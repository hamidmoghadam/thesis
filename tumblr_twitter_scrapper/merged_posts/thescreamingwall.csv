While these events are usually extremely secretive, photographs of this particular Ball surfaced on the web. In short, it is a mix of an âEyes Wide Shutâ-style masked ball mixed with a Lady Gaga-style pop video. Iâm not even kidding. Indeed, behind the fun and games, these pics reveal the underlying ideology and the mind state of the occult eliteÂ  â which is apparently also used in the countless MK/Illuminati theme music videos discussed on this site. The invitation is written in reverse. It required a mirror to be read. Inversion is a big deal in a pseudo-satanic mind state. The ChÃ¢teau de FerriÃ¨res was lit in red to make it appear as if it was on fire. Scenes from Roman Polanskiâs movie about Satan â9th Gateâ were filmed there. In âEyes Wide Shutâ, the occult ritual takes place in another Rothschil" True link

The spice expands consciousness. The spice is vital to space travel. One of the things that Frank Herbert harps on in Dune is that the spice melange tastes different every time you taste it.

Said LA Police Commissioner Crowley, “They say the chalk washes away but that’s not the problem here. The issue is that these sigils are made by amateur occultists who don’t always know what they’re doing. They mean to mark their ethereal turf but several of these alignments are capable of awakening Samael.” Samael, last seen slaughtering the first born sons of Egypt, could not be reached for comment. We at FIMJU wanted more expert testimony however so we invited the mummified head of Necromancer John Dee from its tomb in England for an interview. Said the archetypical wizard, “Where am I? Why hast thou awakened me? Oh how I long to return to the sweet embrace of death, for my every moment awake is an eternity of pain!” Troubling words indeed. Commissioner Crowley.
