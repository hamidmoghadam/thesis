If in p4, which took place in 2011, Rise was a 1st year, she’d likely had been 16 years old. Which means p5 takes place in 2015! So Atlus changed it because of the series of delays they came across.  Now the mystery is solved.  I heard they didn’t add a year because some of the events are similiar to irl ones so … and they have laws that forbid the game from being released if they did. But that’s just speculation, Atlus never confirmed why it was 20XX to my knowledge. " False text
