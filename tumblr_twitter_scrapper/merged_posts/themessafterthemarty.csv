AP classes are harder than college classes.  No joke.  College professors are a lot more liberal on what counts as a “right” answer.  Plus they give you points for caring.  Some classes give you points just for showing up.  There’s an atmosphere of controlled panic, and you are not the only one.  You can pretty much go up to anyone and say god life is a nightmare and finals are gonna kick my ass, and they’ll go saaaaame, regardless of how genius they’re supposed to be.  Seriously.  College student here. High school teachers are the WORST of liars.

If the character of Julia does her job, Ferraro added, “when [children] encounter [people with disabilities] in their real life it’s familiar. And they see that these — these can be their friends too.” A survey released by the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore and Johns Hopkins University in 2012 found that 63 percent of children with autism spectrum disorders had been bullied.
