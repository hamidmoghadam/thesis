Eventually, she can’t decide on how to tell him, so she keeps putting it off until Adam notices she’s acting strange.  Adam: “Are you okay, you’ve been acting very agitated lately” Belle: “No, I’m fine” Adam: “I know when you’re fine, and you are not fine”  They get into an argument, and Belle lets it slip that’s she’s pregnant without even meaning to. Adam goes completely silent, with pure shock and joy on his face. Adam asks if she’s serious, and Belle answers of course she’s serious why would she lie about this? Adam goes silent again, taking it all in. He then finally rushes up to her, picks her up, and twirls her around in his arms.  When they announce Belle’s pregnancy to the royal court, some of the nobles are all “oh have you chosen a nanny/governess?” and Adam and Belle are like “um wtf no?”  Both Adam and Belle eventually (and begrudgingly) relent when Cogsworth insists they hire a governess because they’ve become so tired they’re falling asleep at the dinner table. Still, Adam and Belle take every possible opportunity to see their children. About a month before the birth, Adam suddenly becomes very nervous about parenthood. The shadow of his father looms over him, as well as what happened to his mother. Belle reassures him that he’s not his father, and could never be.  Belle gives birth to twins: first a boy, then a girl.  Adam is pacing the hell out of the floor outside the room in nervousness and anticipation. (”It’s not supposed to last this long, is it?”). Cogsworth tries to calm him down, but it doesn’t work. Finally, the physician exits comes out to deliver the news. Adam rushes into the room, overwhelmed at the sight of Belle, and his new children. He starts crying, and Belle starts crying at the sight.  While Adam and Belle are decisive about their son’s name, they’re less so about their daughter’s. Adam wants to name her after Belle’s mother, while Belle wants to name her after Adam’s. They eventually come to the consensus that the girl with have both of the mothers’ names, and Adam relents, letting Belle decide which order they will be.  Adam rivals Maurice with his overprotectiveness. Belle has to remind him not to worry constantly. Even so, he’s worried that one little mistake will make him like his father.  Belle and Adam take turns readings to their children at night (and sometimes get into playful competitions over who tells the best bedtime story). They also sing to their children. All the time.  The family often go on walks in the gardens. Belle usually recites a passage from the book she’s been reading. One morning, she recites from Romeo and Juliet, and Adam gives her a look and says “you’re not trying to convert the children into loving that, are you?” and Belle just laughs and continues to recite, and Adam can’t help but love it because dammit it sounds so good when she says it.  Their children get Expensive Educations™.  " False text

Like… he literally refers to Belle (and women in general) as ‘prey’, he attempts to murder Maurice when he tells him he can’t marry Belle, he belittles Lefou and uses him as a human shield during the castle fight, he shoots the Beast in the back three times, but sure; he was pretty and fought in the war so poor precious baby. If that isn’t what actually makes Gaston frightening in the first place though. People (in particular women) excusing/overlooking his poor actions in favour of appearances.  Did they just entirely miss who Gaston is suppose to represent? He represents the people in society who use their privilege and influence to oppress others for their own motives.  He is a bully. He uses his privilege and influence to manipulate and ostracise people. He is a misogynistic, sexist pig. He attempts to murder Belle’s father and the Beast because of his greed. He is arrogant. He ENJOYS war and violence- he is practically a sociopath. He emotionally and physically abuses Lefou.  The list could go on.  The Beast- Prince Adam- also spares Gaston when he attempted many times to murder him. it was due to his own foolishness that Gaston dies in the first place.  You can adore Luke Evans but Gaston is a piece of shit in every version of the Beauty and the Beast. He is an archetype of the bully and the oppressor.   Gaston is essentially meant to represent everything the Beast is not. The Beast seems terrifying and brutal and merciless, but is in fact much softer than he appears. He learns to love and becomes selfless and caring and compassionate. But all people see is a monster. Gaston is misogynistic, manipulative, most likely abusive. He’s shown to be violent and cruel. He isn’t above the “if I can’t have the person I like, no one else can” mentality, which is an all-too real cause of violence in the real world. He’s selfish and entitled to the point of being willing to resort to murder to get what he wants. He is an actual monster, but all people see is an attractive charismatic man of high social standing.  “He’s no monster, Gaston, you are.” Belle said it best, really.  Exactly.  Also, everyone needs to take a close listen to ‘The Mob Song’ that is sung by Gaston and the villagers. That song is so close to my heart because it is so accurate in depicting how people can be manipulated into demonising, scapegoating and marginalising the vulnerable because someone (like Gaston) came along and influenced the majority through fear and as well as by ‘othering’ them (in the case of BATB; Belle, the Beast and Maurice)- mob mentality.  And look just how powerful these lines are: “We’re not safe until he’s dead” “Here we come, We’re fifty strong And fifty Frenchmen can’t be wrong”  “We’re counting on Gaston to lead the way!” “We don’t like What we don’t understand. In fact, it scares. And this monster is as mysterious at least”  “Save your children and your wives. We’ll save the village and our lives”  And the Macbeth reference: “Screw your courage to the sticking place!” sung by Gaston. Gaston- Lady Macbeth  This song actually makes me cry and emotional. Gaston is the modern day villain. Belle and the Beast are different to the majority and are people that the Villagers can’t understand. Gaston wants something from them so he uses their ‘difference’ to the majority against them in order to subdue them.  This is why I fucking LOVE this movie. It is so powerful and symbolic of society. That is what makes Gaston a fucking awesome villain because he is REAL and COMMON.   We all know many Gastons.   “There’s a beast running wild, there’s no question, but I fear the wrong monster’s released.”I MEAN. EVEN LEFOU HAD IT FIGURED OUT. PREACH" False text

Today there were sly glances at our director Bill Condon, who thankfully smiled benignly throughout. Behind him and ‘round us there was a further audience - Disney producers who we may not meet again until the movie’s premiere, plus colleagues in charge of cameras, lighting, sound, sets, costume and make-up who will be our constant companions throughout the shooting schedule.Today Beauty and her Beast (Emma Watson and Dan Stevens) read with their supporting cast: and a happy reunion it was for me, next to Mr Holmes’ “Lady in Grey” (Hattie Morahan) along from Bard the Bowman (Luke Evans) and Kevin Kline, who I haven’t seen since we received our Tony Awards together in 1981. The cast were seated 'round four long trestle tables placed in a square. In the middle on their own little stage there was a large clock and a feather duster and a candelabra, who all remained static throughout the morning. Elsewhere, everything and everyone was alive and even kicking, high-kicking too. Bill Condon had decided to put on a show and I’ve never seen or heard anything like it.I arrived nearly late after a two-hour drive across London’s morning rush-hour: and into Shepperton Studios where films have been made since 1931. There were clusters of white roses on the tables and a mike for each actor so we could be heard above the music from the electronic keyboard and percussion and the glorious voices of a 30-strong choir. They were impressive enough, until the studio lights dimmed and the chorus sprang up and danced their merry way through the classic songs by Alan Menken, who was sitting next to Tim Rice who has contributed some new ones. It’s the first time that I’ve heard applause at a read-through, let alone a standing ovation by the end. The legendary Audra McDonald had sung and Emma Thompson too (a cupboard and a teapot in the Beast’s bewitched household).But my favourite moment, because it made me weepy, was when the Beast’s loving arm was placed tentatively on Belle’s shoulder after their pas de deux. Clearly dancing and singing rehearsals had started before today. My own are to come. I’m going to have to work hard to equal what has already been achieved.

Actually, I’m not a huge fan, but my boyfriend is, and when we came out the cinema we thiught the exactly same things. Everything was way too much. Smaug died in 5 minutes and, even if also in the book he doesn’t survive until the very end, everything was so fast that I seriously thought Smaug was somehow faking his death… Beside that and all of the scenes you mentioned, I also found ridiculous the scene where Bard kills a giant ogre by going on an old carriage (wagon? Whatever) and running on it down a downhill in the city near the mountain.That was definitely the moment when I lost it and started talking every single moment (which usually means that something way over the possible is happening in the film).I appreciated lots of other things, though. I loved when all the dwarves went to the doors of the mountain to say goodbye to Bilbo, and I loved the speech between Tauriel and Thranduil after Kíli’s death, but… Yes, I mean… I didn’t like it as I loved the desolation of Smaug, which is my favourite between the three of the hobbit…" False link
