leamichele-news 150686617628 "2016-09-20 16:49:05 GMT" http://leamichele-news.tumblr.com/post/150686617628/scream-queens-star-lea-michele-previews-bats "Warning: This story contain spoilers from the Season 2 premiere of Scream Queens, “Scream Again.”When Lea Michele found out her character Hester was the mastermind behind the murders of Scream Queen’s first season, she was elated… for about 10 seconds.“It was pretty cool to go from being good girl Rachel Berry to a murderous, scheming Hester [Ulrich]. I was so happy when we finally found out at the last minute that I was behind it and I got the Chanels blamed for it,” Michele tells Yahoo TV. “But then I immediately freaked out. I said to the producers, ‘I am happy to be the killer, but I want to make sure that I still get to come backnext season?’ I just want to work with Ryan Murphy forever. Because Ryan and Brad [Falchuk] see things for me that I don’t see for myself. Playing a killer was never on my acting bucket list, but it clearly should have been.”Luckily for her, the Chanels did take the fall for the crime spree at Wallace University and at the Kappa Kappa Tau sorority house that she, her brother Boone (Nick Jonas), and her certifiably crazy adopted mom Gigi (Nasim Pedrad) planned and perpetrated so she lived to fright another season.The first season was so well received. I’m not sure you guys can top it. We are certainly going to try. Partly for selfish reasons because I had as much fun, if not more, making it than everyone did watching it. I’m working with some of my best friends. I’ve known Emma [Roberts] for many years. And having gone from Glee to this, I have such a great working relationship with Ryan and Brad so coming on to do this show was so exciting. We filmed in New Orleans last season. I honestly think Scream Queens, that first season, is going to be a cult classic. That first season is going to be watched and passed from friend to friend for years down the line. They had a lot to top in the sorority season. But so far I am pretty positive that this season is going to be just as loved.We have a new location. There are some great new and handsome actors coming in like John Stamos and Taylor Lautner. We’ve only done one episode so far and I have high hopes. I laughed a lot and I can’t wait for the fans to see what we have up our sleeve.Were you excited to do something scary and gory with an icon of the slasher/horror genre? I am obsessed with horror films. I have been watching them since I was a little kid. Sitting on the couch with pizza and a glass of wine watchingJawbreaker or Halloween or Evil Dead is a perfect night for me. It has been a real treat getting to know and to work with Jamie, who between her and her mother have such an amazing lineage in the genre. I rewatched Halloween on Halloween last year and I sent her pictures throughout. We are following in the footsteps of Halloween 2, which was set in a hospital. I think it is cute that Ryan is continuing  to pay homage to the movie and other classics in the genre.What can you tell us about this season? That is the frustrating part. I cannot tell anybody much about my storyline. I am so grateful to Ryan and Brad and Ian for giving me such fun stuff to play with as an actor for the last eight years. I got to play someone so feisty, so naughty, and a little bit evil last year. This year I am just bats*** crazy and there is nothing I like to play more, as it turns out, than f***ing bats*** crazy.I will say that I have worked with Niecy Nash already and that was a highlight because she ad libs a lot and they really just let her play. I can’t wait to see how they edited that scene together and which of the crazy stuff she said made it. Brad directed it and he just stood back and let her have fun.We know the girls you framed get exonerated and released from the mental hospital. Are they out for revenge? So far there’s been no attempts at revenge against me. The girls are  just happy to be out and free. They are working in the Dean’s teaching hospital. I am somewhere else entirely. I am not working with the girls in the hospital. Obviously, if they are no longer to blame, someone else has to be. When a new killer shows up at the hospital, Jamie Lee Curtis comes to ask my thoughts on what is happening, as she knew I was the killer last time. That is a little tease on what I get to do this year.Last year, they kept the killer’s identity a secret until the very end. Did you like getting information on a need-to-know basis? Do you hope you are the bad girl once again? I didn’t know it was me until I got the script for the last episode right before we filmed the finale. I am glad I didn’t know it was me; I would have played it differently. I  genuinely did not think that it was me. I thought she was weird and a little dark, but I did not think she was one of the killers. I went  along completely unassuming. I think they will handle it the same way this year and keep it completely under wraps from us actors until we  need to know. They even released the finale script but held back the  last few pages until the very end. That made it more exciting for all of us. You never knew if it was your last week or if you were a red devil. I will be happy just to be back whether I am up to my old tricks or innocent this time around.Jamie told us that she was so impressed by how well the cast gets along. These girls are my best friends. Everyone can see on social media that even when we aren’t working we are spending our free time together. They are all great actresses. I’m 30 now too so I feel like a big sister  sometimes. I know Taylor was really nervous about joining the cast  because he’s never done anything like this and we are already all  friends, but literally within one day he felt at home. We love him and he is a part of the crew now. He and John came and fit in immediately. And who doesn’t want some nice eye candy walking around set?Are you happy to be filming in Los Angeles this season, where you live, instead of relocating to New Orleans again?  We loved New Orleans. It is a great town but our personal lives are  here and it is good to be home. Billie [Lourde] and I go to SoulCycle. Emma and I are together doing dinners all the time. I get to sleep in my own bed. And for me it is an extra homecoming as we are back at Paramount using the same soundstages as we did for Glee. They look very different.The show is know for its biting insults and one-liners. What has been your favorite line? The one-liners are already incredible, but it will be hard to top my  best line — “Be man enough to attack my crack” — from last year. But, writers, please try.Can we expect the costumes to be as outrageous and as glamorous as last year? At the moment, Scream Queens is a little more accessible costume-wise this year. The Chanels have had some hard knocks so they are not quite as glamorous as last season. There’s less fur and fewer baubles. It is funny to see them in that position. But they don’t follow rules and they definitely aren’t just going to wear whatever hospital uniform they are given as is. They are still the Chanels, no matter how far they’ve fallen.As for my wardrobe, I am not a Chanel on the show at the moment. I’m not back to the Doc Martens or the neck brace, but am going more simple with jeans and tees and an eye patch. But I will move into a different uniform that is more interesting than the neck brace. I can’t say anymore. I can’t wait for September so we can stop keeping secrets. My life will be so much easier then.Scream Queens returns for Season 2 on Tuesday, Sept. 20 at 9 p.m. on Fox. " True text

We want to chat frankly with celebrities about issues affecting women’s self-esteem. This month Lea Michele, author of the new book You First, sounds off on body image, the pressure to fit in, and why she sometimes needs alligator skin to get through the comments section of Instagram. She spoke with I Am That Girl co-founder Emily Greener. If your mirror could talk back to you, what would you program it to say?I don’t really give my mirror enough time, you know? It’s not about that for me really. Any time I leave my house, I never wear makeup. Any paparazzi picture you see me in, unless I’m coming out of an event, I’m not wearing makeup. I don’t do my hair, it’s usually up in a bun. And I’m in my workout clothes. So looking in the mirror is really not an everyday thing for me. My mirror would probably say, “You’re doing good.” That’s it.How does your style reflect who you are?My style reflects who I am because I basically wear workout clothes every single day. I really feel that I live a very healthy lifestyle, so I always like to have workout clothes on because I’m very active. I get up at sometimes 4 in the morning, or I’m coming home at 4 AM from work, so I need to be in stuff that’s comfortable and I can wear while I’m rehearsing scenes or while I’m getting my hair and makeup done. That’s my day-to-day lifestyle.What is your greatest invisible accessory?My father always told me just be happy, and growing up it would frustrate me because when I was a teenager I’d say, “You don’t know what I’m going through, Dad!” But that was just his constant advice growing up. There was always a lot of laughter in my house, and so for me, my invisible accessory would be that I always find a way to find humor, or to just find happiness in the moment. I know that might feel like the last thing you want to do sometimes, but I just keep that in my back pocket and that really does work.On the days you’re not feeling awesome, how do you deal?Again, with acceptance of those feelings. I grew up with really amazing values and really incredible self-worth and self love. I want [my parents] to write down every single thing that they did so I can just copy it completely to my children. One of my favorite things that my mother does is, I could be feeling any way—sad or angry or whatever—and she just always let me be however I needed to be. Knowing that I could feel however I needed to feel made me feel better and made me feel better quicker. And I’ll also include that on those days, for whatever reason, my mother would always make me scrambled eggs with cheese and toast. There would definitely be some sort of reality TV situation and a nice bath in the evening.What’s your biggest fear?The reality is that I’ve been through a lot in my life, and I definitely have a strength in me that I feel is pretty darn impenetrable. So my fears are just really psycho, gnarly, crazy fears that are so random. I know I could get pretty deep, but I feel like at the end of the day, there’s a lot that I can handle. Still, if you put me in water at night or in a car with more than four people, I definitely would freak out.What lights you up from the inside out?Is it really bad that the first that comes to mind is food? [Laughs] I would honestly say it’s the combination of sitting and eating food with my family. That makes me so happy. Just being able to sit around a table, cook delicious food, and then eat it and laugh and drink wine. I’m Italian. I love pasta. I love cheese. I love red wine. I love bread. And 90 percent of my life is spent eating well and taking care of myself and that food generally makes me light up from the inside, but the foundation of that is my family and that Italian food. I could not be happier." True text

Italian is my specialty. I love making homemade pizzas and pastas from scratch. What does sexiness mean to you?Sexiness to me means feeling good in your own skin. I feel the most sexy right after a hot shower or bath, with no makeup on. Just me. What do you think is your best physical attribute? I’ve been told that my butt is quite special. I would agree.What is your best mental attribute?I would have to say my humor. I think making someone laugh is super sexy.Anything you want to say to the fans that voted you onto the Hot 100 list?Thank you so much to all my fans who voted for me to get me on this list.

Representatives for DreamWorks Animation and Michele did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Kevin Lima, the “Enchanted” filmmaker who also directed Disney’s “Tarzan,” signed on in July 2011 to direct from a script by Gurinder Chadha and Paul Berges, who previously co-wrote “Bend It Like Beckham” together. Disney’s first Bollywood-style animated musical adventure is loosely based on the “Ramayana,” an epic Indian tale about a man whose wife is kidnapped by a demon king. Story follows monkey brothers Raj and Deepu, the latter of whom is younger and will be voiced by Chand. When Raj accidentally releases the ten-headed demon king Ravana from his enchanted sleep, the demon kidnaps Bollywood superstar Chandani. The unlikely sibling heroes then team up with Chandani’s pet monkey Pinki and embark on a thrilling journey to rescue Chandani, save their city and defeat Ravana. Michelle is in negotiations to voice the role of Pinki, though her deal has not closed yet. Lisa Stewart and Chris Chase will produce, while A.R. Rahman (“Slumdog Millionaire”) and Stephen Schwartz (“Wicked”) are working on the film’s music and lyrics, respectively. thewrap  " True text

After dropping the empowering lead single, “Cannonball” last week, “Glee” star Lea Michele is preparing to make the full transition to pop singer on her debut album, Louder, and she admits she’s feeling the pressure. “It’s really scary ‘cause this is all me. But I think that this is the obvious, like, natural next step. I think that ‘Glee’ is the greatest blessing that’s ever come into my life,” she told MTV News. “I am so grateful to [show creator] Ryan Murphy and to, especially, to Adam and Alex Anders, who are the two guys we work on the music with. These guys have made so many dreams come true for me and they’ve helped me create such an awesome platform to continue in my life and accomplish more of my dreams.” And while fans know her small-screen persona Rachel Berry pretty intimately after five seasons of shenanigans on Fox, she says now it’s time for them to know who she is as a person. She explained, “What’s funny I was talking to my mom and she’s like ‘This is the opportunity for people to really get to see you, who you are in a personal way,’ ” she said. “And I’m excited about that because I’ve played a character for so long, singing these cover songs, which has been so awesome, and now I’m kind if ready to let people know who Lea Michele really is.” With Louder only months away from its March 4 release, Michele broke down a bit of what fans will see when it drops. “It’s emotional and uplifting. It’s empowering, and at the same time there’s still those really great songs in it that are just fun and that are happy,” she said of the album, which will also include two tracks written after the death of boyfriend Cory Monteith in July. “There’s still those bright lights and those shining moments within the album. It’s just a really an incredible, somehow, explanation of what this past year of my life has been like.” And, that means that when she gets the time, she also has plans to eventually take Louder out on the road. “Hopefully, eventually, at some point I’ll be able to tour,” she said. “I know that ‘Glee’ we are so lucky to have the most incredible fanbase all over the world, so I really, really hope I get the opportunity soon to do a tour, to get to see all the fans all over the world and bring this album to them.”  " False text

When we entered the room Lea Michele was in, we were welcomed by a huge smile and friendly stare. With that passion that she is known for she answered all of our questions and enjoyed the photography session. She laughed throughout the whole thing, she made jokes and we noticed that even though she’s surrounded by fame, she’s a person that, thanks to her family, has kept her feet on the ground. Cory Monteith, her boyfriend, arrived at the end of the shoot to surprise and support her. A while after this interview, her partner and future husband died on July 14th, leaving Lea devastated and in a situation that, we’re sure, she’ll carry with strength. This is the interview we had with Lea, before she received the news. She talked to us about her book, her new solo album, and she confessed how her life changed before and after Glee. Interviewer:  In what way has your family supported you throughout your whole career? Lea:  I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for my family. They’ve been with me since I was eight until today. They’ve been with me on every step of the way. Interviewer: Tell us a little bit about your audition on Fox for Glee. How was it? Lea: A lot of ironic things happened that day. I was on a car accident on the day of the audition that was really traumatizing, but even after that, I still got the role and a week later I was filming the show. Everything happened really quickly. Interviewer: How did you know from an early age that being on stage was your true calling? Lea: I started to work on Broadway when I was eight years old. I remember that on my first day I told my mom that acting was my favorite activity and that I wanted to do it for the rest of my life. I haven’t stopped ever since. Interviewer: What was the biggest obstacle you had to go through to reach your dream of being an actress? Lea: Look, there’s up and downs in this business, but I have to admit that I have been blessed along the way and I’ll always be grateful for that. Honestly, the hardest thing has been being far from my family because they live in New York and Glee is taped in California, but even with distance we’re still pretty close and we try to see each other as often as we can. Interviewer: Because of your job you have the opportunity to constantly travel to a lot of places, which place would you say that is your favorite place to go? Lea: There’s too many places. I love Paris, Rome, New york of course. I have to go back to Italy and I want to go to Brazil, Spain… There’s too many places! Interviewer: Your life changed completely after Glee, how was the Lea before Glee and how is she now? Lea: Before Glee I lived in New York and I worked in Broadway, so my life was very different from the one I live now. When I got the role on the show I moved to LA and started to work on a tv show, everything was new and different. Everyone would think that Los Angeles and New York are the same because they’re part of the United States, but the reality is that every single state is completely different. Sometimes I miss NY. Working on Broadway, my family, but I love working on Glee. I have to admit that I’m falling more in love with California day by day. Interviewer: In what aspect do you identify yourself the most with Rachel Berry? Lea: I identify the most with her ambition. Interviewer: Glee deals with a lot of current issues, what impact do you think this show has on teens? Lea: Glee has been important from the minute it started because it’s a show that isn’t afraid to reflect today’s society. It deals with important issues like teenage pregnancy, bullying, and we recently had an episode on school shootings. It’s a show in which teens can learn things and talk about them with their parents. That’s why I’m proud of being part of the Glee family. Interviewer: After being famous and knowing fame, how have you remained humble? Lea: When you come from a huge Italian family like mine, they don’t let fame get to your head. They’re always keeping your feet on the ground. I speak with my parents on a daily basis, communication with your family reminds you of who you are and where you come from; that’s really important to me. Besides, I live an easy life, I try to keep good friends and family close. Interviewer: What have you given up on to get to where you are today? Lea: Moving out of the city was a huge transition for me, but I don’t feel like I had to give something up to continue to do what I love. Interviewer: You’re originally from New York, what does the city mean to you? Lea: Everything. I love New York, it’s part of who I am. There’s just something about the city that you can’t find anywhere else in the world. I was born there, I grew up there. I’m happy in California right now, I love the fresh air, the sun, but New York will always be my home. Interviewer: You’re a woman with multiple talents, what new projects are you working on? Lea: My book, Brunette Ambition, it’s coming out soon. We’re starting the fifth season of Glee, I’m doing voiceover for the movie ‘Dorothy’ and I’m finishing my first solo album. I can’t wait till it comes out because it’s a project I’ve put a lot of passion and love in. Interviewer: Let’s talk about your book, Brunette Ambition, what inspired you to write it? Lea: How exciting! I was inspired by my own story. It’s interesting. I tell them that I was born in New York in the Bronx, and then I worked on Broadway. Suddenly, from one day to another, my whole world changed and I stopped being unknown to be a tv actress. I think my fans will be interested in knowing how I got to where I am. They want to know what I’ve learned along the way, funny stories that I’ve lived, who are the people I work with; they’re amazing because they teach me new things like work outs, beauty tips, etc, everyday. Things like this and more is what I’m going to share with my fans. The book has to sections, the first one is a bit 'How to’ and the other one is about my memories. I think it will be fun for any reader. Interviewer: Have you considered going back to Broadway? Lea: Yes. I don’t have a lot of time to do it right now because Glee has two more seasons but after that, of course. Interviewer: There’s always positive and negative opinions, how do you deal with critics? Lea: The best way is to learn to not let it get to you. It’s important to know that the only criticisms that are important are your own. I take constructive criticism but not negative criticism. If you live a calm and normal life, it’s hard for your private life to be public. Interviewer: If you could copy someone’s career, who would you be inspired by to do it? Lea: There’s a lot of careers that I respect and admire, but more than copying someone’s career I would like for others to be inspired by what I’ve achieved with time. Interviewer: Which women do you consider heroes in your life and why? Lea: My mom, my grandma, every single woman in my life. I admire them, they’re a great example to follow. Hollywood wise, I’d say Barbra Streisand. Interviewer: You’ve used makeup ever since you were young. How do you take care of your skin so it stays healthy? Lea: If I don’t work I don’t use makeup. Maybe only a little bit of mascara or lipstick, but I always try to let my skin breathe because using it on a daily basis would be too much. I drink a lot of water, that’s the best thing.   Interviewer: What does it mean to be the face of L'Oreal Paris in the United States? Lea: I’ve been a fan of L'Oreal ever since I was a little kid. I remember that I had thousands of products in my house. Everyone knew how important it was for me to work for them. Honestly, I’m a huge fan of their cosmetics and for me to now form part of the L'Oreal family is incredible. It’s a fortune to work for a company that you believe in and that you can show people how much you love their products, this way.  Interviewer:  Women feel like we’re not satisfied with our physical appearance quite a lot. If you could change something about your body, would you? Lea: I wouldn’t change anything.  Interviewer:  How do you define your style? Lea: I would define it as relaxed and simple. Jeans, flats, and a leather jacket. Lately I’ve been mixing the California style with a dark New Yorker style. If I could, I would use the color black every single day. I like to experiment for red carpets.  Interviewer: What are your  key pieces? Lea:  Definitely my Fiorentini + Baker biker boots and my Givenchy purse. Interviewer: Do you have a favorite designer? Lea: I have a lot of favorite designers: Zac Posen, Oscar de la Renta, Versace, Stella McCartney.  Interviewer: Who are your fashion icons? Lea: I think this is one of the hardest questions because there’s just so many, but I’ve always admired Penelope Cruz. She looks beautiful, classy, and elegant. I would probably say that she’s the prettiest woman in the world.  Interviewer: Have you been to Mexico? Lea: Yes, I actually just came back from there. I went to Puerto Vallarta with my boyfriend and I loved it. It’s a warm place and people are really nice and friendly. The good thing about living in Los Angeles is that because of the distance, I can go to Mexico a lot. Interviewer: Speaking about your boyfriend, you and Cory just went through a rough patch in your relationship, but now that you’ve overcome that, can you tell us what you learned from this experience? Lea: It’s actually interesting to have a relationship when you’re with someone you work with. Simply because you get more attention due to us being couple on the show and also in real life. He is the best person I know, he’s made my life extraordinary, I’m grateful to have him not only as my boyfriend, but also as a co-worker. Interviewer: What’s something that is fundamental for you in a relationship? Lea: It’s important to have someone that supports and encourages you, someone that makes you feel like you’re unstoppable and that you can do anything because you’re with him. Source" True text

And the real question at this point is what we will do. Frankly, I think we need to wait a little bit before we can think about what we want to do.” Ehrlich did say he separtely planned to change up the “In Memoriam” sequence. “I’m not ready to announce what we’re going to do, but it’s really kind of interesting,” he said. “What I can tell you is that there will still be a significant ‘In Memoriam’ segment, but that there are a couple other things that we’re talking about doing.” One inspiration for the change, he added, was a segment he did at the Emmys in 2005, in which anchors Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw paid tribute to their recently-deceased colleague Peter Jennings. “We did a segment that was so beautiful, so evocative and sensitive that it really stayed with me,” he said. “And when we started thinking about this show, that kind of gave me some thoughts about some things we could do with In Memoriam. Ehrlich said he and his production team had not reached out to ""Glee” creator Ryan Murphy, or to anyone personally connected with Monteith. “I think it probably needs a little bit of time to be put into perspective,” he said. “But there’s no question that we’ll have some inclusion of what happened, of his passing on the show.” Even before Monteith died of a mixture of heroin and alcohol in a Vancouver hotel room on July 13, Ehrlich said, he was planning to make changes to the way the Emmys honors those who have died in the past year. In addition to Monteith, television personalities and creators who have died in the last 12 months include James Gandolfini, Jonathan Winters, Jean Stapleton, Gary David Goldberg, Annette Funicello, Roger Ebert, Larry Hagman, Jack Klugman, Charles Durning, Andy Williams and Dennis Farina.

One defining moment is all it takes for two individuals to call each other friends. Cory Monteith’s life, short as it was, taught me that lesson. His death, sudden as it was, taught me that lesson. The defining moment of our friendship happened the third time I joined the cast of “Glee” for yet another memorable shooting experience as Sunshine Corazon. At the set, Cory was cool. Like his character Finn Hudson, Cory was so cool that everything seemed alright with him. I remember the last time I shot for “Glee,” it was May 9, 2011. It was a long shooting day that swelled into the wee hours of the following morning. I was a tad emotional when the clock struck 12 midnight – not because I was tired – but because May 10 was my birthday. And I, a girl from the barrio of Gulod in the far-flung Philippines, was alone in America. My family was not there, my friends were not there, I didn’t have my loved ones there to celebrate my birthday. It didn’t help that we all still had a long way to go on that day at the set of “Glee.” But Cory came to the rescue, just in time, with his sweet greeting: “Happy birthday, Charice!” A big smile crossed his handsome face. There was sincerity in his tone as he gave me a tight hug. He became family to me at that moment.  In the remaining hours of our shoot, Cory told me he had Googled me and found my date of my birth. Cool Cory’s act of kindness. He told other members of the “Glee” cast that it was my birthday and I was floored at how many of them greeted me with their warm birthday wishes.  My body felt cold when I learned about his death. Too soon, too early, too young. I never thanked Cory enough for that one moment in time when he made me feel like family. I never thanked him enough for making me happy on that lonely day. Cory has many fans in the Philippines. In my silence, I mourn with so many of them. Finn was big in my country because “Glee” was big among the many young people in the Philippines. The Filipino people love him because we are a musically-inclined nation and we know how to appreciate real talent. We know how to love real talent. Many of my Filipino friends ask me what will happen to “Glee” now that Finn is gone. I have no answer to their query. But I lovingly ask them to pray for him – for his peaceful passing. I am confident he’s singing with the angels now. I am more than confident that his suave style, his cool attitude about everything will endear him more to his new-found winged friends in the afterlife. To his fans around the world who mourn his passing, I am with you. I know how it feels. Let’s hold each other’s hand. Let’s remember Cory and continue to celebrate his music, his craft, his life. He will forever be in our hearts. I wish I could also embrace Cory’s loved ones – his family and friends, his girlfriend Lea Michele. I will pray for all of you, too. Thank you, Mr. Cool. My grateful heart will always miss you – especially so on my birthday. Thank you. (x)" True text
leamichele-news 55976468847 "2013-07-20 18:34:00 GMT" http://leamichele-news.tumblr.com/post/55976468847/glee-boss-ryan-murphy-opens-up-about-cory "On Friday, Fox announced that production on Glee would be pushed back until August in the wake of Cory Monteith‘s sudden death last week. The postponement subsequently moved the show’s Season 5 premiere back a week, to Sept. 26. The relatively short delay was met with surprise given the enormity of the tragedy, particularly for Monteith’s leading lady and real-life girlfriend Lea Michele. Here, Glee cocreator Ryan Murphy breaks his silence on the actor’s passing, explains the thinking behind the brief postponement (and the role Michele played in the decision), and offers the first glimpse of howGlee will carry on without Finn. TVLINE | Thanks for your time. I know you wanted to talk a little bit about the reason for the one-week delay and why it wasn’t longer. Some people thought maybe it should be.Well, it’s such uncharted waters for me, personally. We had several options. We could delay shooting until November, we could delay shooting until January. But, ultimately, what we decided to do for the cast and crew was start shooting with something that we had already had written. We had written two Beatles episodes in May and had been working on that tribute for four years. We just decided that it would probably be the best for everybody to get back together and be working and have grief counselors on set for two weeks, which we’re going to do. But, ultimately, we made no decisions without consulting Lea. [Executive producer] Brad Falchuk and I talked to Lea and really asked her what she wanted to do. We laid out every possible option. And she was very adamant that she thought it was best for the cast and crew to get back together sooner [rather] than later so that mortgages could be paid and people could take care of their families. Cory was so beloved that she felt people really needed to be together in this time. So we sort of followed her lead. TVLINE | Will you address Finn’s absence in the first two episodes?I don’t think so. We were supposed to be on in the fall with four episodes, and that’s just not going to happen. So we’re going to go on the air with two episodes and right now we’re writing the third episode, which deals with Finn’s death – which, you can imagine, is a very difficult episode to write. [It] has to be done very carefully and with a lot of taste and really making sure that it’s a tribute to Cory. Then, who knows? Maybe we’ll wait to shoot that. We really have to see how everybody feels… We’re going to take a long writers’ hiatus after that episode to refigure the season and continue to take care of the cast and crew and work on setting things up in Cory’s honor – scholarships, what have you – because that’s something we’re dedicated to doing. It’s just a crazy, really difficult, very emotional time. I think what we’re really trying to do is deal with it as a family, which is what that group of people is. Lea is obviously very grief-stricken but she’s also one of the strongest people I know. She wants people to be better and get back to work. So that’s what we’re going to do. TVLINE | So Lea will be back with the show at the start of Season 5, including the Beatles two-parter?Yes. She wants to be with people. The family was her family. She wants to be with the cast and the crew. TVLINE | The tribute episode will be shot immediately after the two-parter, then you go on hiatus?Yes. I mean, who knows how long it’s going to take to craft and what it’s going to be? I just got back into town Tuesday from shooting [HBO's The Normal Heart] and immediately, even in New York, was dealing with the specifics of Cory’s death. I don’t have all the answers. But I just wanted people to know that no decision has been taken lightly and it’s been a week where everyone, from [20th Century Fox TV chiefs] Dana Walden and Gary Newman to [Fox bosses] Kevin Reilly and Peter Rice to [21st Century Fox chairman and CEO] Rupert Murdoch, everyone has weighed in and wanted us to do the best thing for the cast and crew. TVLINE | And in terms of what fans will see on TV, the two Beatles episodes will air, followed by the tribute episode, and then a hiatus? Yes. It’s impossible to start the season with the tribute episode; we have no time to prepare it. TVLINE | You mentioned that you’ve spoken to Lea. A lot of people are really curious about how she’s holding up. It’s just a very tragic thing. It’s been a very difficult thing for all of us, including Lea, to love someone who is an addict. It’s something all of us have been dealing with for many months. It’s a disease and, unfortunately, the disease flared up. As soon as we found out, we staged an intervention with Cory that Lea was 100 percent running out of love and trying to get him better, saying, “Look. Don’t worry about your job; you will always have a job. Don’t worry about fear. Don’t worry about shame. Just worry about getting better and getting stronger…” He was like a son to me… He was both very loving and very sweet and also very stubborn. I really expected him to fight me. He wanted to finish those last two episodes of [Season 4], and that’s when we found out about the addiction flaring up again and I said, “F–k no. We’re writing you out of these episodes. Your life is more important than any stupid TV show. You’re not going to film. You’re going to get in a car right now and get help that I and Brad and Lea have arranged.” I thought he was going to fight me. He said, instead, “OK, I’m so glad it’s over.” He embraced it and went without a fight and got in a car and went to rehab. TVLINE | And you thought he was doing OK? All early reports were that he was doing really well. I spoke to him, and he was really grateful. Lea was very instrumental in trying to save his life and get him the help that he needed and I think for everyone, including myself and her, it’s just a shock. It happened so quickly and without warning, as it often does for many people… She’s also been a rock for many people as well. I’ve never, ever met a 26-year-old girl or boy who’s capable of doing what she’s done in the past week. I marvel at it. I really have taken – as we all have – our lead from Lea. We won’t do anything that she doesn’t want to do. We’re planning a memorial service this week for the cast and crew and people at Fox, everybody who loved him. She’s been planning that and making decisions. TVLINE | Do you have a memory of Cory that epitomizes who he was for you?The thing that I struggle with is the darkness that befell him, it was so the opposite of the person that I knew and tried to save. It was a really hard part to cast. The first time I saw Cory was on a videotape where he was playing Tupperware drums. But he was in the first scene of the first shot when I directed the Gleepilot. It was a scene with Mr. Schue and Finn where they were in Mr. Schue’s office and Mr. Schue was framing him. It was a very strange pilot and it was a musical, which nobody had really done successfully. So people were nervous, I was nervous about it. And I remember after his first take, he came up to me and said, “This is gonna be fun.” (x)" True text

Now it’s happening.’ His face just lit up. He was in great spirits."" Two days later, on Saturday, the 31-year-old Glee star’s body was discovered in his hotel room.

At the home – a well-appointed three bedroom, three story house in the Hollywood Hills with Jacuzzi and built-in grill – were Monteith's roommates including Justin Neill, who runs the electronic cigarette company SmokeStik, and actor Dustin Milligan, who did a stint on the first season of the CW's 90210reboot, and a couple of Monteith's band-mates from his group, Bonnie Dune. Although he kept in touch with his roommates, Monteith had not been seen at the home, in the 8000 block of Hollywood Blvd., where he held a lease through mid-August, for more than a month. He moved out shortly after checking himself out of rehab at Crossroads in April, according to a knowledgeable source. The death of Monteith, who shot to heartthrob status when Glee premiered in 2009, is an all too familiar and sad Hollywood ending. The actor was found dead in his 21st floor room of the five-star Fairmont Pacific Rim hotel by the hotel’s staff on Saturday afternoon. On Monday, Vancouver police will conduct an autopsy to determine the cause of death. Monteith, who in interviews had acknowledged a fierce struggle with addiction in the past, checked himself into rehab last March. At the time, he asked – via his representatives – that fans “respect his privacy as he takes the necessary steps toward recovery.” By that time, the Calgary native had won legions of admirers and was drawing crowds of young girls wherever he went. It was at least his second stint in rehab; his first came when he was 19 years old.  Monteith described a difficult, tumultuous past that included attending more than a dozen schools and eventually dropping out of high school at age 16 (after his first stay in rehab, he went on to earn a high school diploma). “I don’t want kids to think it’s okay to drop out of school and get high, and they’ll be famous too,” he said at the time. “But for those people who might give up: Get real about what you want and go after it.” Monteith at times seemed to wear his fame uncomfortably. When the show traveled to New York to film the second season finale, the actor uneasily but politely signed autographs and posed for pictures with the hoards of fans that materialized at every location including Central Park and Lincoln Center. On Thursday evening, Monteith had dinner at Vancouver’s East of Main Café with Maureen Webb, an early acting mentor and co-founder of Project Limelight, a non-profit aid organization servicing homeless youth that Monteith helped Webb launch last year. It was Webb, then a casting director, who met the 19-year-old Monteith through a mutual friend, who suggested he pursue acting. In a promotional video for the launch of Project Limelight, Monteith admitted that as a teen he struggled to find a purpose in life. “I was fortunate to have the arts inspired me,” he says in the video. “If it weren’t for the teachers and actors who showed me, I would have never gotten into acting. I’d never have been able to find my way. I kind of wish this was around when I was a kid.” When Monteith entered rehab last March, Glee was nearing the end of production on its fourth season. His character, Finn, was last seen returning to the New Directions choir room to be a co-coach of the glee club as he continued to pursue teaching at a college in Ohio. He was slated to be a series regular in season five, which is scheduled to premiere Sept. 19 on Fox. Glee has been renewed through season six, with speculation that will be final season of the series, which has experienced a ratings slide after a massive 2009 premiere and two highly rated seasons. Like many shows, the show’s pull diminished significantly in the 2012-13 season. In moving from Tuesday to Thursday nights, Glee lost 21 percent of its showing among adults 18-49 and finished the year averaging 8.4 million viewers. Still, Glee’s ratings were strong enough to guarantee a renewal. It is Fox’s fourth-best scripted performer – behind The Following, Family Guy and New Girl – and continues to be one of the biggest DVR growers on broadcast television. The most recent season of Glee jumped a robust 55 percent after seven days of time-shifted viewing. [source]" True text

Mr. Monteith played an upbeat high school student and singing coach on “Glee,” but he battled substance abuse problems in his personal life. Calling Mr. Monteith a brother, he expressed his sadness and condolences. And, changing his opening number, he sang a capella, “What I did for Love,” from the musical, “A Chorus Line.” The song was also featured in “Glee” during the second season. At the top of the number, Mr. Morrison also gave a two-fingered salute. As he finished, he acknowledged that it was “awkward” to continue the performance given Mr. Monteith’s death, but said, “You guys came to see a show, I came to perform a show, so that’s what we’ll do. And we’ll do it in Cory’s honor.” He went on with a set of Broadway show tunes and jazz standards, even dancing on stage and quipping with the audience about the infamous drug-den history of the space under the 1970’s club, Studio 54 where the performance took place.

He was 31. His devoted girlfriend, Lea, wasn’t with him at the time of his death. A source close to the actor tells HollywoodLife exclusively that she is ‘devastated’ beyond belief. Lea Michele, 26, and Cory Monteith began dating in early 2012 and were together for a year and a half. The Glee songstress was clearly not expecting to receive the tragic news about the one she loves. Cory Monteith’s Death — Lea Michele’s Reaction: “She [Lea Michele] is absolutely hysterical and completely inconsolable,” a source close to the actor tells HollywoodLife exclusively. She is devastated beyond belief.” At this time the cause of the actor’s death is yet to be determined and no foul play is suspected, however Cory was always very open about his struggle with substance abuse and began his second stint in rehab in March 2013 — and his devoted girlfriend bravely stood by his side during the difficult time. It’s clear that one of the people he was closest to, his loving girlfriend, had no idea that he might still be struggling with this addiction. In fact just last week Lea took a quick girls trip to Cabo San Lucas, to celebrate the birthday of her friend and jewelry designer Jennifer Cohen. The Glee gal seemed so happy and carefree while having fun in the sun, snapping pics of her pedicure and sharing a slew of bikini pics on Instagram. Cory Monteith’s Substance Abuse Struggle: While the actor’s most recent stint in rehab was mere months ago, he first checked in for his addiction when he was 19. In an interview with Parade magazine back in 2011, he candidly addressed his struggles with substance abuse, saying he often stole money to be able to afford his addiction. “I was out of control,” Cory said. “[I used] anything and everything, as much as possible. I had a serious problem.” Cory’s mother staged an intervention in order to help her teen get clean. “That’s when I first went to rehab,” he said — but his sobriety didn’t last long. “I did the stint but then went back to doing exactly what I left off doing.” Eventually the actor made the decision to get clean — and he said it was a life-changing decision. “I’m lucky to be alive,” he admitted. The actor was born and raised in Victoria, B.C., which isn’t far from Vancouver, where his body was discovered. Our thoughts are with Lea and Cory’s friends and family during this sad time.

leamichele-news 160434052658 "2017-05-08 06:10:01 GMT" http://leamichele-news.tumblr.com/post/160434052658/lea-michele-revisits-her-roots-in-theater "Lea Michele might have entered pop-culture mainstream via her role as Rachel Berry on TV’s “Glee,” but the New Yorker is no stranger to theater, appearing on Broadway at age 8 as Young Cosette in “Les Miserables.”She still recalls her unusually calm opening night. “It just felt completely natural. And I remember telling my parents when I was done that I just wanted to do this for the rest of my life, and if I didn’t love it as much as I do, I couldn’t have done it so consistently over these many years,” says the singer, who brings her tour to The City this week.Michele, 30, went on to anchor Broadway smashes including “Ragtime,” “Fiddler on the Roof” and finally “Spring Awakening” in 2006, where she was discovered, and hired, by “Glee” creator Ryan Murphy.She now resides in Los Angeles, where she’s been pursuing TV projects such as “Scream Queens,” Hulu’s “Dimension 404,” and a new ABC comedy pilot from Daveed Diggs.But she went down a theatrical avenue on her new recording, “Places.”“That’s what this album was about for me — returning to my roots,” she says.While she didn’t consider her 2014 debut “Louder” a misfire, she says it was put together during her hectic “Glee” schedule and she recorded roughly a dozen diverse soundtrack songs a week.“Vocally, I didn’t feel like I could give my own album my all, and I just felt like mentally my head was in a lot of different places, with different genres,” she says. “So for ‘Places,’ it was very important to me that it was cohesive, and timeless, and a real vocal album.”She waited until “Glee” (which ran from 2009-15) to finish, to approach it with a blank slate.The star developed an idiosyncratic songwriting system: She brought stories and observations from her daily journals to key collaborators, Ali Tamposi and Stephen Wrabel, to create panoramic backdrops for her Streisand-inspired vocals, in “Hey You,” “Getaway Car” and “Run To You.”She also accepted equally majestic contributions from Ellie Goulding (“Heavenly”), Mozella (“Anything’s Possible”) and Chantal Kreviazuk (the symphonic “Love is Alive”).“The minute I heard ‘Love Is Alive,’ I knew it was the lamppost for this entire new record,” says Michele, looking forward to performing it live, on a tour that also includes “Glee” numbers. “I really love writing, and it’s something that I’m still perfecting. But it’s important that whatever I’m singing is true to me, and it’s a story I can connect with.”" True link

Then came more Broadway roles — in Ragtime, Fiddler On The Roof and Spring Awakening — before she became Rachel Berry on Glee.Now, Michele has a new album that plays off her stage history. The title, Places, calls to mind the announcement that actors hear backstage just before the curtain goes up, and Michele tells NPR’s Scott Simon that’s not an accident.“This is my second record; I had the privilege of recording my first album, Louder, in 2014,” she says. “The sound of that record was a little pop-heavy, and it was important for me, with recording this second record, that I really connect with my true sound. … I wanted a title that was sort of a call to all of that, and a call back to my roots.”Michele says one of the songs on Places, “Hey You,” is in some ways the sequel to a song she wrote for Louder about the loss of her boyfriend and Glee costar, Cory Monteith.“With writing the first song, it definitely had its darker tones to it,” she says. “This song in particular — it comes from a much more healed place. It’s just about thinking to yourself, if you had five minutes with someone that you lost, what would you say? And I realized it would be a much more simple conversation than you would imagine.”Michele spoke with NPR’s Scott Simon about her journey to Broadway as a child, learning more than 800 songs for Glee and the sometimes-confusing process of developing her own style.

That show was, after all, a smash hit, that propelled Michele, as well as her co-stars, into the public eye.Glee came to an end in 2015 and, in the two years since, Michele has been racking up acting and singing roles. Up until last year, she portrayed killer Hester Ulrich on the horror parody Scream Queens, and her pop debut Louder came out in 2014. She recently dropped her sophomore record, Places, that shows Michele returning to the Broadway style that she got her start in.Ahead of her performance at the Palace of Fine Arts, we chatted with Michele about Glee, her new record, and which superhero she would like to be.Lea Michele plays at 8 p.m., Wednesday, May 10, at the Palace of Fine Arts. More info here.SF Weekly: Now that a couple of years have passed, what are your feelings on Glee?Lea Michele: I look back on that with the greatest memories. That was such an incredible experience. We were all so blessed to have had that journey that we all got to go on together. I’m sure at the time it felt overwhelming, but I really tried to embrace it and stop all the time and go, “Wow, look at this. Look at how incredible this is.” I look back on it so fondly.SFW: It seems like the rest of the cast is starring in superhero shows now. If you could play any superhero, who would you choose?LM: Oh, my God. I’d be a superhero any day. I feel like all the good female superheroes are taken, so maybe I could just come and play like Supergirl’s super-powerful sister.SFW: Did Glee prepare you for a life as a recording artist?LM: I think Glee was an amazing experience and a really great education as far as what being a recording artist means. Coming from Broadway, that was also a really great education of what it’s like to be live on the stage. So I think everything that what I’ve done in my life has really helped me get to where I am today, and has really prepared me for this time in my life, as far as being a solo artist and being in the recording industry. It’s not an easy place to be in. It’s pretty cut-throat. But I really feel like I can hold my own, and I’m really honored to be able to be making my second record now.SFW: How has your sound evolved from Louder to Places?LM: This one is a little bit more theatrical — it’s more of a vocalist’s album. I learned a lot with my first record, and I wanted my sound for this album to be different. I feel like I’ve really achieved that. I feel like this album is a representation of who I am, where I am in my life right now, and who I am as a performer. It’s important as an actor in this business, or in anything that you do, that you really feel proud to say, “Yes, this is me and I stand by this.” I really do stand by this entire record. Not that I didn’t with my first, but it was such a hectic time for me, and I’ve really had time over these past three years of working on this record to make it my own.SFW: You’ve dabbled in a lot of singing styles throughout your career. Is there any genre of music you wouldn’t sing to?LM: I mean, some genres on Glee were more difficult for me than others. I would never say never, so you never know. I just know what works for me. I grew up listening to Barbara Streisand and Celine Dion, and I’m so inspired by Adele. This is definitely where I am right now, and I sort of feel like this is what I was born to do.SFW: How do you balance careers in music and acting, post Glee?LM: It takes a lot of time and it takes a lot of mental and physical strength. I do what I can to make sure that I take really good care of myself, and I balance my life so that I’m not over-exerting myself. It is challenging and I don’t want to spread myself too thin. But I really love singing and I love acting. I’m very grateful that I get to do both.SFW: You’re heading to San Francisco soon. Are you excited?LM: I love S.F. It’s one of my favorite places. I used to spend a lot of time up there — it’s incredible.  I can’t wait to come and do the show there. I’ll try and catch Hamilton while I’m there too. I have some friends in the show. It should make for a really fun time.SFW: What can we expect from the set at Palace of Fine Arts?LM: I do a couple of songs from my first record, a bunch of songs from the new album, and then I do a great little medley of Glee songs. That’s really one of my favorite parts. For me, it’s such a great moment to reminisce on a time in my life that was really important and special to me. I tell little stories about what those songs mean to me, and each night I kind of switch it up. It’s really great because that was such an important time in my life and to get to have that personal one-on-one connection with my fans, and tell them what that was like for me, is really special.SFW: After this tour, what’s next for you?LM: Hopefully more shows. I’d like to tour and be on stage as much as possible. I’m also working on a new ABC comedy that I’m really excited about. We just shot the pilot, so hopefully it’ll continue and we’ll get to shoot some more.  It’s a comedy about a young rapper who ends up running for town mayor and he wins. It has all original hip-hop and rap in it, so I’m excited to be on another television show with another musical element. I’ve got a lot on my plate but I’m really excited about everything."

(In 2014, she told Billboard “If You Say So” was about Monteith, telling the magazine: “It will always represent the most devastating thing that’s every happened to me in my whole life.”)“I love it. I think it is such a beautiful song, and it has such a beautiful message,” Michele says of “Hey You.” “Despite it being about a more sensitive subject matter, when I listen to it, my overall feeling that I get from it is just joy and love.”Indeed, Michele says she’s in a very positive place in her life these days.“People have a perception of who I am and where I’m at right now,” she says, “because of everything I’ve been through … But I am so happy. And I feel so strong.”Watch the full episode on Lea Michele, streaming now on People/Entertainment Weekly Network (PEN).

So venturing out on her first solo tour has been a nerve-wracking part of promoting her new album.On tour with a group, Michele said, performers get to take breaks between their songs and rely on other people to make the show successful.“This is really just me doing it all on my own,” she said in a recent phone interview. “That makes it a lot more scary, but it’s definitely something that I feel ready for.”The former “Glee” and “Scream Queens” star released her second album, “Places,” on April 28. Her tour makes a stop at Seattle’s Moore Theatre on Monday, May 8.Michele’s first album, “Louder,” was released in 2014 while she was still a cast member on “Glee.” The album’s first single, “Cannonball,” debuted at No. 75 on the Billboard Hot 100, making Michele the first “Glee” cast member to make the Hot 100 list as a lead solo artist.“I had the most incredible time recording my first record,” Michele said. “But it was during such a busy time for me, working on ‘Glee’ and recording an album at the same time. I had personally a lot happening and professionally a lot happening.”Michele said working on “Places” gave her an opportunity to write music without being influenced by “Glee.” She drew inspiration from artists such as Celine Dion and Barbra Streisand, as well as her time on Broadway.“I wanted it to sound like me,” Michele said. “The album has a little bit more theatricality to it than my last, and it’s much more of a vocal record.”“Love Is Alive,” the album’s first single, is an emotional ballad, which Michele described as “the umbrella of the entire record.”“It really represented the sound that I wanted to create and the message I wanted to relay,” Michele said. “Every song that came after that on the album really just grew from ‘Love Is Alive.’ ”Another song on the new album, “Anything’s Possible,” is a more upbeat tune about empowerment. Michele wrote ”Anything’s Possible” knowing that many fans have viewed her as a role model since she starred on “Glee.”“A lot of people might consider that to be an overwhelming task, but I find it to be quite an honor,” she said. “We have a lot happening in our world right now, and I think it’s important to have songs that have this message. That’s what music is for.”Despite the pressure of performing solo, Michele said she’s excited to start her tour. Since she was unable to go on tour for “Louder,” performing live for fans became a priority the second time around.“One of my biggest goals for releasing the second record was to jump immediately into touring and performing,” she said. “It’s where I come from and where I feel the most comfortable. I wanted to have the opportunity to go around and thank my fans for being so supportive.”" True link

Since 1918, this gorgeous 1,870-seat cultural paragon has hosted some of the most iconic productions and featured some of the most beloved and esteemed performers of all time. From George Gershwin musicals to Hamlet, notables such as John Barrymore, Helen Hayes, Katharine Hepburn, Sammy Davis Jr., Angela Lansbury, and Laurence Olivier have all graced this celebrated stage.Last night, Monday, May 1, 2017, the elegantly attired vocalist, Lea Michele, took her rightful place as part of that elite list of extraordinary entertainers when she kicked off her tour to a capacity crowd. Her immaculate set featured songs pulled from both her just released Places album and her debut, Louder, as well as choice selections from Glee. In between songs, the charismatic artist engaged her audience with stories and wickedly fun, off-the-cuff interactions with fans who continually professed their love and admiration for the artist throughout the entire evening.Backed by five accomplished musicians — three strings, drums, and a keyboard —Lea’s voice was always the effortless star. She was an absolutely adorable diva who playfully “demanded” such amenities as hot tea to keep her voice ever flawless while she performed.Over the course of the evening, there were numerous times when the impassioned roar of cheers completely overwhelmed the venue’s impressive sound system making it feel like The Beatles had just taken the stage at The Ed Sullivan Show. However, the moment the crowd absolutely lost it was when Lea brought out her good friend Jonathan Groof (Frozen, Hamilton, Glee, Spring Awakening) and the pair performed “Rolling in the Deep,” a song the TV couple had performed together on Glee.That attention to emotional detail is what made Lea Michele’s show so perfect. She has a way of creating unforgettable moments. The night was filled with goosebumps, laughter, tears of joy, and love… both for Lea and from her. She is a remarkably delightful spark of brilliance who is unfathomably talented and possesses a kind heart. As a performer, she is truly in a league of her own. On her new album, you can hear the talent and feel her heart, but to experience the full Lea, you need to see her live." True link

There’s just something so incredibly special about her. She’s effortlessly charming and sweet like the perfect girl next door. But she also shines with a radiant sparkle, the kind that only the biggest stars have. It was Lea’s own personal magic and astounding vocal artistry that made Rachel Berry — the first captain of the William McKinley High School glee club — one of the most beloved characters on “Glee.” No matter how many diva moments she had, we never stopped loving her.On April 28, Lea will release her brand new album, Places, a resonant masterpiece of striking emotional beauty. Just a few days after that, on May 1st, she will kick off her “Intimate Evening” tour at Philadelphia’s Merriam Theatre.“I haven’t been to Philly in a really long time,” Lea began. “I sang the national anthem at the World Series there with ‘Glee’ a few years back. I think that might’ve been the last time that I was there. I called some of my friends who live there and asked them what the Merriam Theatre was like and they told me it was a beautiful, beautiful space. I can’t wait to see it!”Lea was born in New York and spent a number of her formative years in New Jersey. Besides choir, she played volleyball and was on the debate team at Tenafly High School.“I’m really excited because I’m getting to kick off this tour on the East Coast so I know that a lot of my family from New York will be there,” she expressed. “I’m excited for people to get to see this concert that we’ve been putting together and working so hard on. We wanted to make sure it was something that everyone would enjoy.”“I guess there’s no turning back now,” she added, laughing. “It’s just weeks away!”A little over three years ago (February 28, 2014), Lea released her debut studio album, Louder, on Columbia Records. Because she was so busy working on “Glee,” she didn’t have a lot of time to promote the release. In many ways, the artist confessed, “Places feels much more like my first experience than it does my sophomore album.”“It was very challenging recording my first album and releasing it while in the midst of ‘Glee,‘” she continued. “It was difficult for me to figure out what my own sound was as a solo artist — you can hear some of those inconsistencies on that first record. I wanted to wait till I was completely finished with ‘Glee’ and take some time to think about what I wanted this album to sound like. Who am I really on my own?”But just because “Glee” ended, it didn’t mean that Lea slowed down with her acting. “Dreams Come True,” the final episode of the series, aired on March 20, 2015 and just six months later, on September 22, 2015, FOX aired the first episode of “Scream Queens.” In this outrageously twisted slasher series, Lea plays Hester Ulrich, a Kappa Kappa Tau pledge who wears a cumbersome apparatus — which promptly earns her the nickname “Neckbrace” courtesy of Chanel Oberlin — and claims to have scoliosis. It turns out, however, Hester is actually a rather twisted but remarkably brilliant sociopath who nearly gets away with murder. A whole lot of murder.Currently, you can see Lea along with Robert Buckley and Joel McHale in the “MatchMaker” episode of Lionsgate, Hulu, and RocketJump’s new sci-fi anthology series “Dimension 404” (created by Dez Dolly and Will Campos). The highly imaginative and mind-bogglingly innovative series explores the unexplainable and probes that eerie feeling of unsettling weirdness that hits you around 3:00 a.m. at night. In “MatchMaker,” Lea plays Amanda, a girl who is such a perfect match for a music blogger named Adam that he attempts the unthinkable just to be with her again after she abruptly dumps him.“Places is an amazing representation of where I’ve come from and who I am as an artist,” Lea informed. “I’m 30 years old and I’ve had a lot of experiences throughout my life, both personal and professional. This album definitely is a big representation of everything that I’ve experienced, but especially over these past three years. I feel like I’ve grown a lot and come to a really positive and beautiful place in my life. I’m very thankful for that. There is a maturity in this record. It was important to me that this album was timeless, but I also wanted it to represent where I am in my life today.”The songs on Places came about in one of three ways: they were sent to her, like “Heavenly” from Ellie Goulding and “Anything’s Possible” from MoZella (“Wrecking Ball”); she would sit with a small group of writers and talk about stories and concepts that were meaningful to her — “Tornado” came out of one of those sessions; or she would sit down and write them like she did with Ali Tamposi on “Hey You.”“The songs are all either personally written by me or from my own personal story or they were sent to me. If they were sent to me, they had to be something that I personally connected to — I cant sing anything that I don’t feel makes sense for me,” she noted.The track listing for Places is 1. “Love Is Alive,” 2. “Heavy Love,” 3. “Proud,” 4. “Believer,” 5. “Run To You,” 6. “Heavenly,” 7. “Anything’s Possible,” 8. “Getaway Car,” 9. “Sentimental Memories,” 10. “Tornado,” and 11. “Hey You.”Although she admits there are those rousing tracks like “Love Is Alive,” which allow her to spotlight the exquisite power of her voice, on songs like “Sentimental Memories,” Lea pulled back to offer fans something a little different. “There’s something to be said about the simplicity of a song. Simplicity can be as impactful as those big moments.”In regard to her songwriting, Lea told Entertaining Options, “I definitely know what I want to write before I sit down. But the process of creating an album involves writing some things that work and some that don’t. When I wrote ‘Hey You,’ I intended to write a breakup song, but ‘Hey You’ is definitely not a breakup song! You just kind of see where the journey takes you. It’s all so exciting because you never really know what’s going to come out. At the end of the day, through all the different turns and experiences, you hopefully end up with a cohesive album that you’re proud of. I am incredibly proud of this record.”“We worked so hard on this tour. We put together a bunch of songs from Places as well as a few songs from Louder. We also have a really great section that features some of my favorite songs from ‘Glee.’ That was something I really wanted to incorporate in the show, paying homage to ‘Glee.’ It was such an incredible experience. I’ve been asking fans online which songs they want to hear from the show. If you come, you’ll get to see which ones I do. And before I perform each song, I tell a little story that goes with it. I’m pretty private with my life, but in concert, that’s my time to really open up and connect with my fans, so I really hope that people get a chance to come out and see me perform.”“No homage to Hester?”Lea laughed. “For everyone sake, no.”" True link

Anything you’re excited to see on your stop here?Yes! I’ve been to Boston before when we came for the “Glee” tour! I was so excited to go to Boston that my cast mate Dianna (Agron) and I came a couple of days early so that we could spend more time in Boston. We had such an incredible weekend and I always remember it. So I’m just excited to get back. It’s one of my favorite cities and I’m so excited to perform there.How have you changed as a person since your first album “Louder” came out?So much has happened since “Louder” came out. I finished “Glee,” I worked on “Scream Queens,” I lived in New Orleans for a year. These past couple of years since “Louder” have been really incredible. I truly feel I’ve grown as a performer and as a person. I’m in such a settled and happy place in my life right now and I’m so happy to be able to do what I love and get to be back on the stage.You’ve got the music and TV markets cornered.

She recalls first auditioning for a role in the Broadway production of Les Miserables when she was 8. Two weeks later, she was performing on the Great White Way.“I walked off stage I turned to my mom and dad and I said to them, ‘This is what I want to do for the rest of my life and don’t ever let me stop,’ ” she explains.Michele went on to star in the musical Spring Awakening before landing roles on Glee and Scream Queens, but her heart remained at the theater.“Now I think it’s so important for me at this point of my life to just really embrace the parts of my sound and my look and my artistry should just be so true to who I am and where I come from. I come from Broadway and I come from New York,” she says. “I have a very theatrical voice. I grew up listening to Barbra Streisand and Céline Dion. I mean, that was all I wanted to listen to. That was my inspiration for this record.”She adds, “If it sounds too theatrical or whatever, this is just me. Everyone’s like, ‘What does your album sound like?’ It’s like, ‘I don’t know. It just sounds like me.’ ”Michele explains that she feels most comfortable through singing and can’t wait to show her work to her fans.“If you want to know what’s going on in my life, just listen to my music,” she says. “Just listen to my songs because that’s where I really feel like I can open up. I’m excited to be able to share these parts of my life with the people who have been with me and following me over these past years.”Places is available now via Columbia Records." True link

The actress has nearly 5 million followers on Twitter.“None of that would have happened if it weren’t for “Glee,” Michele said. “The great thing is that my fans have moved on with me on the next phase of my career. When ‘Glee’ ended [in 2015] I just focused on this album.”Michele has morphed quite a bit since her pedestrian 2014 album “Louder” dropped. Michele takes her fans to a variety of different places but there is also a common denominator running throughout the album.“This album is a homage to the women I grew up listening to,” Michele said. “That includes Barbra Streisand and Celine Dion. They are both beyond amazing. Female vocalists are the connection. I had some fun with the pop songs. Hopefully, the album will stand the test of time.”Michele co-wrote five of the 11 tracks for “Places,” which was released on April 28. “I wanted to challenge myself,” she said. “I love to write and I love to sing. I love the stage.”The Bronx native cut her teeth on Broadway as an 8-year old when she joined the cast of Broadway’s “Les Miserables” in 1995. In 1998, she starred in “Ragtime” and “Spring Awakening” in 2006.“There is nothing like Broadway,” Michele said. “That experience helped form who I am.“Michele, who earned an Emmy, a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild award for her work on “Glee,” will perform music from the series during this current tour, but the focus will also be on “Louder” and “Places.”“There will be a balance,” Michele said. “I’ll do my songs, but I’ll sing some favorites from the show.”Michele hopes to return to the studio to make a follow-up album sooner than later. “I would love to do that,” Michele said. “I want to focus on music.”When Michele’s tour ends, expect her to retreat to her favorite getaway: Napa. “I’m obsessed with the wine and the food there,” she admitted. “The spas are amazing. It’s so relaxing in Napa. I’m more of a green, woodsy type than a white, sandy beach girl. I love the mountain air. When you combine the air with the wine and the food in Napa, it’s just perfect. You can find me somewhere in Napa when I’m not on the road performing.”" True link

And then, of course, Céline Dion, is just incredible. Chantal, I’ve not met before, but she actually wrote a song [Burn with You] on my first record as well and I grew up listening to her music. Feels Like Home was one of my favourite songs.”24 Hours caught up with Michele (whose label asked that we didn’t talk about Cory) down the line from L.A. before her sole Canadian date on Saturday (May 6) at Toronto’s Massey Hall as part of an intimate six-date mini-tour of North America.Are you excited to be performing in Canada again?I lived in Toronto for awhile back in the [late] ‘90s. I was working on a musical [Ragtime] there. I’m so excited one of my concerts is in Toronto. So it will be really cool for me to get back there. The last time I performed in Toronto [was when we] did the Glee tour there. I have such a love for Toronto.Why was it important for you to return to your theatrical roots on Places after your more pop-oriented first album, 2014’s Louder?It’s definitely the sound of my voice that I feel comes more naturally to me. My first album did veer a little bit more into the pop world, which at the time, I was excited to do. Now I just want to go back to the sounds I grew up singing to and listening to like Barbra Streisand and Céline Dion - and this album is a vocal album.I understand you preceded the Places mini-tour with a warm couple of shows earlier this year?Yeah, so it was really important to me with releasing this second record to get on stage immediately before an album was out. I want people to know that I was born to be a live performer and that performing on stage is one of the most important things to me. So I did a couple of practice shows in L.A. and New York in January.What do you perform from Glee?I do My Man, I do To Make You Feel My Love and then I sort of switch it up. Some nights, I do some songs; some nights, I don’t. I’m working on maybe adding Poker Face right now.You’re a veteran performer despite your young age. Did anything prepare you for the success of Glee?Nothing could have prepared any of us, I think, for the massive success that came with Glee. But definitely working on Broadway and having some great success in New York prior to coming to L.A. was a great preparation for what was, you know, like a huge thing in all of our lives.Did you get a chance to watch fellow Glee star Heather Morris (who played Brittany on the TV show) dance on Dancing with the Stars before her elimination?I [didn’t] get a chance to see her but Heather has already won Dancing with the Stars. She’s basically the best dancer I have ever seen in my entire life. But, yes, of course, so many of the cast are doing such great things right now. I did a couple of songs with Darren [Criss, who played Blaine] that we released on our YouTube channel. So I really love him. And Chord [Overstreet, who played Sam] has few songs out right now.Any TV roles in your future?I have a new pilot that I’m working on for ABC. I’m very excited about it and we’re just at the beginning stages right now, but I also really like to do television as well as music so I feel very lucky that I always get to do both. I’m one of the leads and it’s this great show that has some original hip-hop music from one of the writers of Hamilton. And it’s a 30-minute comedy … That’s as much information as I can give right now.Are you binge-watching anything right now?I just watched Big Little Lies, which was absolutely incredible, and I’m currently watching Pinky Blinders right now, which I’m loving so much.

leamichele-news 160085490018 "2017-04-28 14:45:05 GMT" http://leamichele-news.tumblr.com/post/160085490018/lea-michele-finds-her-voice-on-places-and "Though she’s only 30, Lea Michele has pretty much done it all. She began her career on Broadway at the age of eight (where she spent 15 years of her life), then transitioned into TV playing lead characters on the hit series Glee and later Scream Queens (which we’re crossing our fingers will be renewed for another season), and made her debut album Louder in-between. It’s clear that the singer-actress’ life is her art and vice-versa. While her first record strived to be more mainstream pop, Michele has taken a different approach on her sophomore album, Places. Instead of striving to be the next Britney Spears or Ariana Grande, Michele focused on what came naturally to her, what she enjoyed the most and what showed her most authentic self. Michele wanted the focus to be on the strength of her vocals for her second LP. Taking cues from Barbra Streisand and Adele, Michele crafted a record that sounded like her, something that would be representative of her ability to perform. Along with the central focus on Michele’s voice, she centered Places around personal anecdotes that she could share with her audiences during her performances, since her fans are so important to her. And at the heart of it all, is the concept of love in all its forms, something Michele dives into with her powerhouse vocals on her 11-track album.Places comes out today, April 28, and before its release, we caught up with Michele about not making a pop record, collaborating with Darren Criss, and whether or not she’d head back to Broadway. You had said this record was more of a Céline Dion-esque record. How do you think it will resonate with your fans?For me, I think that when I made my first record it was obviously a little more pop-heavy. Taking this turn into making a new album that’s focused on my voice, that’s similar to the records that I used to listen to growing up, like Barbra Streisand and Céline Dion, it definitely comes with a lot of nerves because it’s not the traditional pop route everyone is taking. It’s a risk, but I really wanted to be true to myself and hope that my fans love it. I think there is this desire in me for people to hear good singers and good voices. I hope that they love it. I think when people listen to it they’re going to be like, “That’s Lea Michele. That’s the voice I’ve been wanting to hear.” Do you regret releasing Louder?Not at all! I still listen to Louder all the time. At the end of the day, I regret not having enough time to promote it or perform. This is what I do. This is what I was born to do. That’s why even releasing Places, I’ve started doing live performances to show people that this is what I love the most. I really love it, and I’m proud of it. It means so much to me. Like everything in life, you move on to the next thing and make better choices and with that education and you can only grow and become better. You said at the listening party that this record is a lot more personal for you. In what ways will we see that?I think it’s the most personal because I really sound the most like myself. It’s more vulnerable for me. I talk about a lot of things on this record, there are a lot of songs about love. Even if I didn’t write the song, I contributed to the concept, everything came from group writing sessions, where I’d tell these stories about my life. That’s where all of these songs came from. I didn’t want to put anything out there that I couldn’t perform or talk about that’s so true and personal to me.What were you listening to when you made Places?Just the record. I can get influenced by different sounds and you can hear that in my first record. That’s why when I was making this album it was important for it to sound like me and no one else. I couldn’t listen to too much without it blurring the lines for me. Personally, I listen to tons of music though.One of the most devastating parts of your life was losing your ex-boyfriend and co-star Cory Monteith. Did that play into this record?I think that with that subject… at the end of the day, when I say one thing people make it into 100 things, so I try to keep a lot of that stuff pretty personal.In a perfect world, when we talk about legends, who would you want to be compared to?I think at the end of the day there are so many incredible performers. For me, I’m so inspired by women who have the ability to stand there and sing and have the greatness of their performance focused on the sound of their voice. I just went to Adele’s concert and was in awe of how she commanded her performance. If I could do something like that, I would be so pleased.Do you plan to focus on your music the rest of 2017?Yeah! I’m also working on another television show right now, an ABC pilot. But I’m so excited about these tour dates I have coming up. I want to play as many places as I can before I go back to either Scream Queens or this new show.How did Places become the title of the record?The album is really coming back to my form, my true self and my true sound. I grew up on Broadway and one of the biggest broadway references is ‘places’ at the top of the show. It’s what’s said over the intercom before it’s time to go onstage. For me, it means showtime. It’s going back to who I am and where I’m from.What will surprise fans on Places?I really think I pushed myself beyond what I thought could do vocally I think some songs are more vulnerable than others. I think at the end of the day, I hope people say, “That sounds like Lea Michele. That’s a Lea Michele record.” That’s really my biggest goal here.Would you ever make a straight-up pop album again?I kind of think that’s like saying how would you raise your next child before you even have one. I think I learned a lot from my first record that I applied to my second one. I’m so happy with this one that I have to give it all of my attention before I think about the next thing. Maybe I will find another sound, but I think you have to step away to get inspired. It took me three years to make a second record. Maybe the next one won’t. Who knows?Do you see yourself going back to Broadway?I get asked that a lot, and I would absolutely love to get back to Broadway. Broadway is the hardest thing you can do. I consider it such an accomplishment that I was on Broadway for so many years. Right now I’m just focusing on my album, but if Broadway were to call, I’d be there in a heartbeat. What’s your advice for up-and-coming artists?I think it’s so cheesy, but you have to just be true to yourself. You’re going to be encountered by so many people giving so many pieces of advice. At the end of the day, you’re the one you have to be comfortable with. When the lights go down, you’re the one on the stage. What was it like collaborating with Darren Criss again on your album?It was so incredible. I adore him; he’s such an awesome guy. After Glee, we all stepped away to work on our own things. We’re all obviously still close friends, but we all focused on our own stuff. We just thought it was a good time to do something together. We just wanted to do something for our fans. We both feel so grateful to be where we are, and we wanted to reminisce on such an important time in our lives. Were there any songs you were on the fence about putting on the record?There wasn’t anything I was going to put on the record that I didn’t feel was 100 percent right. Again, it took three years to make the album—some things got added and some things got cut. “Love Is Alive” is the first song I recorded for Places, and it’s the first track on there. I feel really confident in the album, and they all represent me. They all have different stories and if you come to my concerts that’s where I break down what the songs mean to me and what the backstories behind them. It’s cathartic and kind of like therapy in a sense. How do you hope this album will help other people because it’s been so cathartic for you?For me, I’ve been placed in this position as a role model for some of my fans. It’s not a position I take lightly—I hold it with a lot of respect and be the best role model can be. With this album, I made sure these songs were inspiring and had a lot of light and hope to them. When I heard “Anything Is Possible,” I knew it had to be on the record because it’s so inspiring. I think my first record has a lot of heaviness to it, but even on some of the darker songs, there is light underlying theme on the entire record. That makes me really proud. I hope that these songs give people the strength that they’ve given to me. " True link

With her angelic voice she then bagged the lead in FOX’s hit musical TV show Glee as the spotlight-demanding Rachel Berry, from 2009 until 2015. Amidst the Glee-mania she released a solo album Louder in 2013, which put her on track for mainstream success. She has since played Hester Ulrich in the kitsch-y horror-comedy show Scream Queens(2015) alongside Emma Roberts. Now, Lea is back with a second album, Places, so we caught up with her to find out a little more about it before she sets off on tour.Places has been a long time in the making, you must be excited?I am! It’s been about 3 years now working on the record to get it out there and for everyone to hear it.How does Places differ to Louder?They really differ a lot. I’m really proud of my first record but it was a really big learning experience for me. I think that it was difficult recording and releasing an album whilst also performing on Glee at the exact same time. So, I really took the time after that to think about what I wanted this album to sound like and to make sure that I had the time to promote it and tour it.I think there’s a lot of pop references in my first record, and this record definitely veers more towards the songs that I grew up listening to. The natural sound of my voice is a little bit more theatrical and I think this [album] is a representation of who I am as a singer and as a performer.What did you want to say in this album?There’s a lot of songs about love. All different kinds of love: happy love, dark love, heartbreak… But for me, I’m in a really positive and happy place in my life right now and I think that you really do see the lighter, more positive aspects in this album. It’s really inspiring and [full of] those love songs that really open your heart. When I grew up listening to Celine Dion all of her music was just so inspiring to me and really shook me to my core, and that’s what I wanted to do with this album.Where are you most looking forward to performing?I’m obviously so excited about coming to London. I didn’t have the opportunity to tour my first record, so having the opportunity to tour now, to get to go places and sing these songs, it means to much to me. I’ve appreciated my fans overseas so much for their patience and their dedication, so to finally get over there and thank everyone and meet everyone – it just means so much to me and I can’t wait.What are your plans when you come to London for your tour?I don’t come [to London] as often as I would like but this time I have the opportunity to spend a nice amount of time there. It’s one of my favourite places. I love the hotels that I stay at and have restaurants I love to visit when im there. My good friend Amber [Riley] is in Dreamgirls [on the Westend] so I’m going to see her.Who in the industry do you admire?Obviously Adele – she’s so incredible but she really stays true to who she is, and that’s something I really admire.Who would you love to collaborate with that you haven’t already?There’s so many incredible artists. I would love to obviously sing with Celine Dion, I think that that would be incredible, and Adele. Just get all the divas on the stage and sing together!What’s the one thing you always take with you when you’re on tour?My cellphone or my iPad - to get work done and keep in touch with my family. [Touring by myself] is going to be kind of scary!You’re really into your health and fitness, but how do you stay in shape when you’re on the road?The best way to stay in shape when you’re on tour is to sightsee. The minute I get somewhere I put on my shoes and I walk about and that’s the best way, because it’s hard when you’re travelling to go to a gym. I want to be out and about I walk around, especially when I’m in cities like London or New York because it’s so easy to walk around and sightsee. You can walk for miles and it’s such a great work out.Do you see yourself going back on stage?Right now the tour and performing this album is my main goal. I love being on the stage, which is why it was so important for me to release this album and lauch this tour at the exact same time, to show everyone that this is where I feel the most at home. I’m so proud of this concert that we’ve put together, and we do a bunch of songs from Louder and from Places and also from Glee. I think that people will really enjoy it.You’ve used your platform to speak about social issues: you’re an activist for human rights and animal rights and last year you released a video in tribute to the victims of the Orlando shooting. Will you touch upon issues close to your heart on your tour?Outside of working I try to do as much charitable work as I can. I have some organisations that are very close to me and when I’m not working I try to devote as much time I can to making an impact and using this platform that I have for good. My tour is very honest and intimate and it is where I open up to my fans and have that personal 1-on-1 connection.Lea’s new album ‘Places’ comes out 28 April" True link
leamichele-news 160080876128 "2017-04-28 11:10:05 GMT" http://leamichele-news.tumblr.com/post/160080876128/lea-michele-takes-a-break-from-tv-stardom-to-open "When actress-singer Lea Michele starts her tour Monday at the Merriam Theater, she’ll attack booming theatrical songs from her just-released Places, her 2014 pop debut Louder, her career-defining television smash Glee, and dramatic tunes from Broadway, where she made her start in 1995 as Young Cosette in Les Misérables.In the immediate post-Glee landscape, what sort of gigs did you want? What songs did you want to sing?I’ve been performing since I was 8 years old, straight onto Broadway, and then straight into television. I’m grateful for that and happy to have been performing such great material since a very young age. I’m living my dream. Knowing that has always been a nice way of going forward, no matter what I was doing.Do you ever wonder if knowing so much so young is a blessing and a curse?Honestly, I just think of it as a blessing. A lot of people search and search forever for a path in life. I knew what opportunities were out there. I had time to be able to figure out what to do with what I loved most. Every day I get to live that, and for that I am so happy.When you made your first album, you were filming and touring with Glee. Do you have a greater sense of focus on Places?Building a television show and recording my songs – that was definitely a challenge. For me, the most difficult part was finding the time to go out and perform my own stuff as much as I would have liked.Performing onstage is your thing.Exactly. That’s where I’m most home and alive. So my main goal with this new record is – though I am still doing a television show regularly – to utilize the free time that I have in my life to get on the road and perform this. That’s actually why I set up tour dates before Places was finished. The live show takes some songs from Louder, the new album, Broadway classics I’ve been involved with, and even some tunes from Glee with me telling stories about my life at the time I came in contact with those songs. I think the whole show really represents me. Maybe I didn’t have the time back then to do this right, but I have the time now.Being that you were a musical stage baby from early on, who were your first heroes?Obviously, Barbra Streisand. But being that I was on Broadway as a kid, I had the chance to meet and work with some incredible, awesome talents. I worked on stage with Audra McDonald and Idina Menzel when I was young; both women were so wildly talented. They were mentors then, but now I get to call them friends.The new album actually harks back to that theatricality, as opposed to Louder’s brand of pop.Yes, definitely. It is who I have always been and I wanted to highlight that, finally.So now you can get as loud as you want to get.[Laughs] For sure.I like that the title feels so open-ended. I wanted the album to show where I come from – the stage – where I got my education. “Places” in theater is where they put you, where you have to go at the top of the show. It is my version of yelling “show time!”Ryan Murphy break: You went from his Glee to his new-ish, blackly comic Scream Queens, yet he’s gone from the grueling vicious American Horror Story to the catty, but feminist-friendly Feud. Did you know he had this rich, dark streak in him, and would you like to do something gorier?Prior to Glee, Ryan had Nip/Tuck which was one the craziest shows ever. I definitely enjoy him doing horror. I’d love to be on that [American Horror Story]. I also enjoy doing comedy, which is great because I’m doing a comedy pilot for ABC [executive-produced by Hamilton Tony winner Daveed Diggs].On the last album,you wrote with Sia. On Places, you wrote with Linda Perry. Ellie Goulding gave you a song for the new album, too.I’m absolutely grateful to work with such talented women. That’s incredible to me. I definitely know what I want to talk about when I sit down to write, whether it is an experience or a feeling. When I do the show, I’ll tell you just what I was thinking when I wrote.Can you give us a hint with “Getaway Car” and “Hey You""?“Getaway Car” is about first love. I remembered growing up in high school and driving around with my first boyfriend … you know, feeling butterflies, listening to music like Tracy Chapman’s “Fast Car.” “Hey You” is very personal. I can’t tell you who it’s about but people will interpret it for themselves and make of it what they like. I’ll talk about that during the show. You should come. I walk down memory lane and talk about the future." True link

So I’ve been brushing up on a lot of my legal jargon.”The ABC comedy is a departure from Michele’s previous credits with Murphy, Glee and Scream Queens, but she said she would “of course” love to star in another Murphy production down the line.“Oh my god! Of course! But I’m really excited I’m going to be on a new show, and I love my boys on the show,” she said. “I’ve been working with girls the past couple of years, but I love my Scream Queens, and I obviously love Ryan Murphy. So I will come back whenever he will have me.”In between shows, Michele has been making headlines with her Instagram “Bed Series,” which she hinted might turn into something even bigger.“We’re actually going to take the bed series to the next level,” she said of her nearly-nude photographs. “We’re going to do a real fun shoot coming up soon. So we’re going to hire a professional photographer.”" True link

But her travel life? Well, that’s hardly all sequins and lash extensions — because it turns out her ride-or-die travel essentials are all about comfort. “Lately I travel like every single day,” she told Jet Set. “And I’m traveling on tour right now because of my album. Oh my god, I’m traveling all the time, and the hardest part is just staying healthy on the road.” True story! (Here are some tips from a Real Housewife that might help, Lea.) These are the essentials that keep her going:1. Sneakers“This may sound crazy,” she told us, “but working out is so important to me, and it doesn’t matter if I’m only in town for a short time — I’m going to make time to work out. Fitness is important, which means traveling with good sneakers is non-negotiable in my life.”2. Essential oilsIf it seems like everyone is on board the essential oils train lately, you’re right — because even mega-celebs like Lea claim certain blends keep her calm and happy when she’s on the road. “There are a few blends that are made just to have soothing, calming effects that I literally cannot travel without. You use a few dabs and it’s like the world around you changes. They’re on every flight with me and in every hotel room.”3. Hummus and carrot sticks“You know what makes me such a diva? I put Sabra hummus and carrot sticks on all my concert riders, and it’s been my go-to snack since I was basically a kid. Eating healthy on the road is nearly impossible, and I’m either spending all my time googling where I can get healthy stuff or dipping my carrot sticks all day.” Hey, Lea: If you think carrots and hummus make you a diva — well, consider these over-the-top tour demands! (But full disclosure: Lea has a promotional deal with Sabra.)4. Yoga pantsCelebs, they’re just like us — because even they want to live their best lives in stretchy pants. “I cannot ever get enough workout clothes. I can’t get enough of the comfortable stuff, and when you’re on the road a lot you start to get homesick. There’s something about just wearing really comfy workout pants or pajamas that sort of makes you feel less homesick, and I love that. I wouldn’t even consider traveling without my workout clothes!”5. Noise-canceling headphones“It’s not even about the noise on the plane, it’s just the noise of everything and the opportunity to disconnect and have real quiet time. My noise-canceling headphones are super important to me because that few hours on the plane or in the car might be the only time to myself that I actually get.”" True link

Below, singer and actress Lea Michele shares hers. Read more Pride Month love letters here.I wanted to offer a note to the LGBTQ community who has supported me throughout my career and who are a constant inspiration to me. Having performed on Broadway throughout my childhood and having the privilege of being a part of Glee for so many years I have covered so many important topics that often centered around the LGBTQ community.One story that stands out and I will always remember was when a little girl with her two moms came up to me after seeing Glee and told me that she was ‘as cool as Rachel Barry’ because Rachel had to dads and she had two mommies. That comment really hit home and I was so proud to be a part of such an important television show as well as so proud of the way we honored and represented the LGBTQ community. Pride is a strong word and one I don’t use lightly but there is no better word to represent and celebrate this incredible community of people. I send all my love to the LGBTQ community." True link

A scroll through her Instagram reveals as much: there’s Michele hiking up a sun-drenched trail in LA, or looking serene and sweaty post-SoulCycle. And that’s just skimming the top of her workout enthusiasm. “I’m really loving Body by Simone right now,” Michele tells SELF recently at the Popchips Skinny Chipping 10th Birthday party in LA. “I’ll do a couple classes there every week, a couple classes at Core Power Yoga, a bit of SoulCycle, and I have a great hiking trail in my backyard, so I go on a hike once or twice a week.”The actress—who just wrapped the tour for her album, Places, and is now preparing to shoot her new TV show, The Mayor—prefers to work out in the morning. “It’s much harder for me to feel motivated [to work out] midday,” she explains. “It’s good to do it in the beginning of the day, not just to get it over with but because it gives me such great energy to use for the rest of the day.” Michele’s days are so dialed, we had to know more. Here’s how she gets it all done.1. Michele’s breakfast sets her up for a good workout.“Usually I wake up, have my breakfast, then go and work out,” says Michele. “My breakfast is usually egg whites and avocado in the morning, and after my workout I have a green juice.” When she’s running late, she’ll improvise. “If I don’t have time, I’ll swap it and have the green juice first.”2. She stays energized throughout the day with healthy snacks.Michele says she’s a huge Popchips fan, so she’ll always have some stocked at home (barbecue, salt and vinegar, and sour cream and onion flavors are her favorites). She also keeps her kitchen stocked with other healthy snacks: hummus and pita, carrots and tzatziki, goji berries, fresh berries, and seaweed snacks. “I think if you keep healthy food available at home, you’ll end up making better choices,” she explains. And, in case you were wondering, she also loves the occasional midday avocado toast just as much as us.3. She also sets aside time to restore and reenergize.In her downtime, Michele likes to enjoy a glass of wine with her mom or a trip to the spa. No matter what—whether it’s working out or getting a massage—Michele makes taking care of herself a priority. “Self-care has always been my number one,” she says. “When I’m not working, I’m taking care of myself. That way, I can be the best at my job.”" True link
