A couple years ago while I was working for a care center during my ece training - we had a big thing about spankings. We went around and asked children who were spanked how they felt about it and what it told them or how it made them feel.  Then when the parents were over, we anonymously read everything that was said by the children on how they view spankings and unanimously it was found that the children never saw it as a growing experience. It was “painful” “really scary” “I thought mommy hated me now” and we often found it never actually TAUGHT the kids what they did wrong. in fact it seemed to teach them that at any moment your mommy or daddy would just haul up and smack you until you cried and said it was for your own good. Needless to say I’m pretty sure we changed a lot of parents opinions on spanking and SHOCK OF SHOCKS actually TALKING to their children worked far better disiplinary I even included my own story, pretending I was telling an outside story “well, I happened to know one person who’s mother only stopped spanking them cause they got tall and big real fast so they could fight back. so there’s a lot of intimidation and fear to your children.” and just - I’ll never forget the dawning look of realization on their faces  The most common argument I hear is, “Look, my parents spanked me and I turned out fine.”Stolen from elsewhere on the internet but now my defult response:  “No you didn’t–you think it is okay to hit little kids.” " False text

In proclaiming “Zeke is not the guy you think he is” and that “there is deception on levels y’all don’t understand,” Varner is saying that I’m not really a man and that simply living as my authentic self is a nefarious trick. In reality, by being Zeke the dude, I am being my most honest self — as is every other transgender person going about their daily lives. I don’t believe Varner hates trans people, just as I don’t believe conservative politicians who attack trans people actually care where we use the bathroom. For both, trans people make easy targets for those looking to invoke prejudice in order to win votes. Thankfully, my tribemates rebuffed his hateful tactics.

The “Issues” tab of the site used to have sections on LGBT rights, civil rights, and climate change. Those tabs are all gone.  Here’s what replaced them: The page that used to house the office of national AIDS policy is gone too. I don’t know what to do. I can’t believe this is real. Oh my god, this is real.  " False link

It’s a coloring thing that looks great, and says FREE all over the place. But it tries to get you to agree to a THIRTEEN DOLLAR PER WEEK subscription, and makes it difficult to cancel the subscription. This is a scam that most people won’t fall for, but I’m boosting the signal because we all know someone who will fall for it. " False link

The judge also ruled  that plaintiffs were likely to prevail in court on their claim that the  new policy infringes on the rights of private healthcare providers under  the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. As  explained in O'Connor’s 46-page opinion, the plaintiffs argued that the  new regulation would “require them to perform and provide insurance  coverage for gender transitions and abortions, regardless of their  contrary religious beliefs or medical judgment.” The  same judge issued a similar court order in August blocking a separate  Obama administration policy that would have required public schools,  over the objections of 13 states, to allow transgender students to use  restrooms of their choice. It was  not immediately clear whether the Obama administration, which has just  20 days left in office, would seek to appeal the latest injunction.  In 21 days your right to choose will begin the path to being completely outlawed. " False link

The sign, written in both English and French, reads, “People with no money welcome to eat for free.” That goodwill gesture has won the restaurant, located at the corner of Ste-Catherine Street West and Mackay Street, a lot of praise online. The restaurant’s co-owner, Yahya Hashemi, said they’ve been giving free meals to the hungry for about five months now. He added that they consider it as a business expense. “We don’t think about how much it will cost us,” said Hashemi. They serve free meals to about four or five people a day, and staff do not ask questions or judge anyone who asks for a free meal, he said. The idea began when Hashemi, who also owns the currency exchange service next to the restaurant, realized how often he would be asked by people in the area for spare change to buy food. At first he would give them money to spend in the restaurant, but then decided it would be simpler to put up a sign in the window welcoming everyone to eat for free. “Some are shy, some don’t believe we are offering this,” said Hashemi. Originally from Iran, Hashemi said it is part of his faith to help those in need and he wanted to give back to Canada since he says it has given him so much.  Continue Reading. " False link
