And while he often butted heads with Jim Gordon, he also was a mentor and a father figure to the young detective. Plus, his unwavering moral code showed Gordon that you can make a positive impact on the city without resorting to bribery, extortion, and questionable alliances with the underworld.However, once Barnes was infected with the Alice Tetch virus, it brought the darkness lurking deep inside him to the surface. As Executive Producer John Stephens explains to us: “His desire for justice overwhelmed his ethical code, and transformed into the Executioner, summarily hunting down, trying and executing criminals whom he deems guilty.”Head down to our gallery to check out exclusive images of Barnes dressed in his Executioner costume, which features a Mad Max-like leather get-up, a menacing blade replacing his left hand, and exaggerated charcoal eye makeup that reminds me of Daryl Hannah’s look for Priscilla “Pris” Stratton in Blade Runner.You’ll have to tune in this Monday to see Barnes transformation, though I’m sure Indian Hill mad scientist Dr. Hugo Strange is to blame.In the comics, Batman and Robin fought a criminal who used the identity of the Executioner. His real name was Willy Hooker and worked at a carnival. To make an extra buck, he would break criminals out of jail and then kill them so that he could collect the reward money. He only appeared in one issue: Detective Comics #191 (January 1953)." True text

But their search is interrupted by Barnes, who has been sent after Gordon by Kathryn. Wearing a ridiculous leather jumpsuit, and an axe on his arm kinda like the titular villain in “Batman: Mask of the Phantasm,” Barnes has fully embraced his virus-fueled identity as the Executioner and is determined to punish Gordon for his perceived crimes. Honestly, I was biased against this story from the start. I have never liked the way the show has written the balance of blame in the disintegration of Gordon and Barnes’ relationship, or the attitude Gordon has consistently given him. And Michael Chiklis hasn’t been able to make the character’s over-the-top turn work the way actors like Cory Michael Smith and Erin Richards have. But watching the episode, it’s also clear that it’s just a stall in the overarching Court of Owls arc and that made it even more boring to me.In the more interesting subplots, the reunion between the Penguin and the Riddler isn’t a bygones-y one, but the friends-turned-foes soon realize they’ll need to work together if they want to best the Court of Owls. The shaman continues to manipulate Bruce and, to that end, shares a secret about his connection to the Court. Alfred goes on the warpath after finding out about “Five.” And Leslie’s grief takes her down a self-destructive path. All four stories have their moments, but it’s the Bruce and Leslie ones that travel to particularly intriguing places." True link

Approximately a million things happen this week, some of them are entertaining, a few even make sense. Mainly, this episode is just bonkers. Let’s begin…Jim’s still desperately trying to find the Court of Owls’ weapon, with Harvey by his side and Barnes on his tail. I know the early case-of-the-week format isn’t exactly popular, but there’s real pleasure to be had in watching Jim and Harvey work together here and know that Harvey will always have Jimbo’s back, whatever trouble he gets into. In fact, this is a great episode for Harvey, with writer Ken Woodruff really nailing his self-deprecating humour and his increasing disbelief at the chaos unfolding. The plot? Crystal owls, explosions, that sort of thing. Don’t look at it too closely.As much as I like Michael Chiklis, the whole Executioner storyline is rather too broad and silly for me to enjoy: the one thing Gotham can normally be relied up on to do is create compelling multi-faceted villains, so the Executioner plotline is something of a let-down. However, I appreciate a) the wild spread of destruction Barnes leaves in his wake here; and b) the shocking moment that lets us know Barnes is very much his own man and not the Court’s weapon to control.Last week’s epic Oswald/Edward stare-down promised great things. It’s a shame that the main event this week is a shallow affair, relying on the pair sniping at each other and trading insults. Where did you go, emotional nuance?It’s also a little jarring to hear Ed - a man who was so cut up over the loss of Oswald that he took hallucinogenic drugs - went on a murder spree and started wearing a deeply unfortunate hat, casually talking about killing Oswald again. Is this Ed’s repression talking? Is he so far gone now that it simply doesn’t matter anymore? Or is it just a case of ‘plot imperative’? Everybody line up, Airplane style, to slap some sense into him.The chemistry here is such that the jail-break storyline could never be boring, but it is rather unsatisfying overall. Gotham has devoted a lot of time this season to the peaks and troughs of this relationship, and to have their big reunion seem so ultimately throwaway is a waste.You guys, Gotham trolled us. Remember how relieved I was last week for them to be moving somewhere new with the Bruce storyline? Well, surprise! That “somewhere new” involves them doing pretty much the same thing, only back in Gotham. If I never see those vision needles again, it will be too soon. The good news is that we do finally get an idea of the Shaman’s long-game. The bad news is that Bruce seems entirely enthralled with the guy. This will not end well. On the plus side, what we’re starting to see here is that the Court is merely a front for something much bigger and much more powerful. Their days in charge of Gotham might be numbered.I’ve probably moaned for long enough, so let’s talk about something REALLY good: the visceral early fight between clone Bruce, Selina, and Alfred. Yes, the cat is out of the bag. Alfred’s response to Bruce’s abduction is to get Old Testament levels of angry and violent, which is oddly satisfying. Scary, but satisfying. You do not come between Alfred and Bruce and get away with it and Alfred’s ferocious pursuit of his missing ward makes me wish Sean Pertwee got more to do.Also good? Jervis Tetch. So repellent and yet so compelling.And then, before we go, the final scene brings us a character making a decision so bad that I literally face-palmed right onto my coffee table.

When actor David Mazouz spoke to CinemaBlend recently about Bruce’s downward spiral, he told me things are only getting way darker. But could things go so wrong that Bruce actually kills someone? It’s not clear, but it sure sounds like it. In Mazouz’s words:[Bruce] is so desperate to find the answer that he believes what these new influences in his life have to tell him. He is going to be conditioned in a way that it looks like he will never be able to return, and I don’t know that he ever fully will be able to return. And maybe that’s why he eventually chooses to put on the cape and cowl. But your question of ‘Will he take these destructive forces back to Gotham City when he eventually returns?,’ the answer is completely yes. He will be a completely new person. And in order to break away from that, he will have to be stripped down to his most bare and vulnerable state in order to build himself back up again as the man that we know from Batman, and the man that we started to see him become before this transformation. But throughout this transformation he will be stripped of all of his morals and it will take a great deal of effort and time and support from his loving characters around him to get back on the right track.Now, if you describe just about anyone else in Gotham City as being vulnerable and without morals, you’re not going to have a hard time imagining that character committing a murder or two. This show seriously has far more leads who are guilty of killing others than those innocent of it. But again, this is Bruce Wayne we’re talking about, and Batman is one of the only fictional heroes out there who has repeatedly made declarations that killing people was not his M.O. for bringing justice to the world. But let’s not forget that Batman is nowhere near the events of this series yet, and Bruce Wayne is currently a teenager whose body and personality are equally malleable to those in an advantageous position. So if he’s currently being developed into a Gotham-destroying warrior, how could he possibly take the city down without dropping a few bodies?Of course, it would have been a lot cooler if David Mazouz had specifically referenced Bruce punching someone’s throat out or running over a villain with a car, but we all know actors can’t get quite so loose-lipped with their upcoming twists. And in any case, no one really expects Bruce Wayne to become a killing machine on Gotham, so there are other logical steps to take with that information. (Such as…well…maybe Bruce could give Jim Gordon a wicked big wedgie.) In fact, it wasn’t that long ago in Season 3 when Bruce had the chance to kill his tormenter Jerome, but he refused to go down that non-retractable route.Still, even with all the reasons against, it’d be one thing if David Mazouz had made only a passing reference to Bruce turning into a less virtuous citizen of Gotham City, but he drove that point home. It could have been passionate enthusiasm, of course, but I choose to think conspiratorially in this case. Especially since Mazouz continued down that same speculation-friendly path when talking about Bruce’s current sense of “goodness.”I don’t think Bruce is all good. I think there is a great deal of darkness in him. There are evil urges inside of him also. I feel like that’s really what makes him so flawed, and not just in Gotham, but in all of Batman’s incarnations. He, of course, has a really strong moral compass. At the same time, I feel like he has the capability of knowing what it is to be bad. But I feel like with all of our characters, good and bad, we see hints of the other side.Great deal of darkness inside or not, viewers haven’t really gotten a chance to see that side of him play out in a way that affects anyone beyond himself. Sure, we know he’s a depressed dude because of his parents’ death and the havoc that followed, but he doesn’t ever expel that darkness out into the world the same way that Penguin or even Selina does. It’s apparently going to happen soon, though, and it’ll probably look pretty badass, too. And my biggest question then will be the same as it is now: is Bruce going to kill someone?" True link
justgotham 160781586857 "2017-05-17 22:19:10 GMT" http://justgotham.tumblr.com/post/160781586857/why-queerbaiting-accusations-baffled-gotham "When it premiered in 2014, the premise of Gotham was easy to explain: the show is a prequel to the Batman mythology as comic book readers, animated series watchers, and moviegoers already know it. It’s telling not just the origin story of Bruce Wayne’s alter ego, but the origin stories of the theatrical, malevolent bad guys who’ll plague his version of the city. And perhaps the most sympathetic downward spiral has been the transformation of umbrella boy Oswald Cobblepot into the criminal mastermind known as Penguin. Gotham added another step past the point of no return for Oswald this season when he was jilted (and nearly murdered) by Edward Nygma (Cory Michael Smith), who Oswald claimed to be in love with. For both characters to stay on their trajectory towards city-threatening super-villainy, they couldn’t have a happy ending. Yet some Gotham fans cried “queerbaiting” on social media when the relationship was never consummated. In an interview at Bustle HQ, Robin Lord Taylor says that “queerbaiting” accusations “baffled” him. Homophobic backlash, he sadly anticipated. But not that.“So, of course I expect ‘f*ggot this’ and 'gay that,’ and 'they ruined the show,’” Taylor says. “We had a little of that. But on the other hand, I was not expecting on the progressive side of things, still that same exact insistence on putting people into a definable box — into a box that [viewers] can also identify with — as opposed to letting an experience happen.”Taylor is protective of Oswald, murderer though he may be, but more protective of presenting an authentic experience. As he talks about his character’s romantic awakening and some fans’ perception that the show had cultivated 'shipping via performative homosexuality with no intent of “following through,” he leans forward in his chair and punctuates his words by lightly punishing the tabletop.The criticism is especially frustrating to Taylor because since he heard from the writers that Oswald would be developing these feelings, he’s taken an active role in helping the show tell a story that doesn’t “ring false.” When I ask him how he first reacted to the pitch, he chooses his words carefully and gives me the fears first.“My big concern was like, OK so, this is the first time I’ve heard about any sort of alternative sexuality to Oswald, be it anywhere on the spectrum,” Taylor says. “Even any mention of any sort of romantic interest. I myself am gay, so I knew that this is not going to be a traditional story of someone coming out of the closet.”While other Gotham baddies want power more than anything, power is just a vehicle for Oswald to achieve something else: validation and love. Taylor sees the former Gotham City mayor as a person who’s “very emotionally, physically, sexually immature,” possibly because his self-worth “has been beaten out of him” after years of abuse and ostracization.“I wanted to be true to what I know and understand of human sexuality and it’s not that you” — he snaps his fingers — “wake up one day, and you are gay. And to say that you are gay means that you identify with a group of people; it’s a cultural thing,” Taylor says.For him, Oswald doesn’t claim that orientation, nor any other. Taylor was determined to keep his character’s discovery “a romantic, yearning need to connect with somebody” rather than strictly sexual interest, because Oswald’s understanding of himself is so limited.“It was the Riddler — the first person who showed any respect or understanding or even enjoyment of Oswald’s company,” the actor says. “Who’s to say that if it was Barbara that it couldn’t have been her? I wanted to keep that ambiguous. Because what I understand of my own personal experience being gay… this is something that I’ve been thinking about my entire life. It’s always been a part of my life.”Of course, Oswald’s wooing of Ed didn’t go exactly as planned. (Isn’t it just like the Penguin to kill the competition to get her out of his way?) But Taylor says these two characters are inextricably linked to each other, even if Nygmobblepot 'shippers should get used to the idea that there’s no white picket fence on the horizon.“It’s a one-sided romance thing, but in [the April 24 episode], it’s when the Riddler announces himself and he’s taking pills and he’s having hallucinations and he’s hallucinating Oswald and you can see in those exchanges — not romantically, he didn’t have that for Oswald — but there still was a love and a respect and a need on his part too to connect with him,” Taylor says.You’ll remember that scene: it’s where Ed has a vision of his old friend Oswald singing a sultry Amy Winehouse song. (They recorded his vocals, by the way, in the same studio where Winehouse laid down hers — an experience Taylor says made him ask himself, “What the hell am I doing?”)“If you watch it back and you notice: this is the first time you see Oswald in the traditional tux and tails and top hat, which is the traditional Penguin look,” Taylor says. “And I love that he didn’t come up with that look initially. That was the Riddler. So it’s almost like Riddler created part of me. And they’ve created each other, there is no one without the other.”It’s the coexistence of their kinship and their bad blood that make Riddler and Penguin quintessential Gotham bad guys. And that brings Taylor back to the misguided complaints that those crazy two kids just can’t make it work.“It’s never going to be the show where people live and fall in love and live happily ever after. This is a story about how these people become psychopaths,” he says. That’s the theme of the series for the actor: “What happens when love is ripped away? When the access to love or to be gentle or be respectful — when connection between two humans — when that is ripped away, what’s left after that? And in this case, this is how these people go from villains to super-villains.”It wouldn’t be Gotham if it were populated with happy, fulfilled people. This heartbreak is bringing Oswald ever closer to the villain fans know from Bruce Wayne’s canonical future, and his new alliance with Dr. Strange’s “freaks” is a part of that. But in spite the vast range of reactions to Oswald’s Season 3 arc, the actor is pleased that it provoked a reaction at all.“What I love about it is that it created this much bigger conversation,” Taylor sums up. “I’m talking about queer politics. I’m talking about where people fall on the spectrum. This is a giant conversation that we’re having, that’s originating in a Batman story.”Even a heightened world like Gotham’s can still have a lot to say about the world we live in, and Robin Lord Taylor is determined to keep it (close to) real."

Season 3 has been particularly fruitful in laying out the stepping stones for Mazouz’s Bruce Wayne to reach Batman-dom, and especially where his fisticuffs are concerned. The actor spoke with CinemaBlend about Bruce’s journey and his current training sessions with the mysterious Shaman, and I was pumped to hear that the best is yet to come where fights are concerned. Is Mazouz’s words:[Something] I’ve found very exciting this year is how many fight things I’ve been getting to do. I feel like, especially towards the end of this season, every episode I had at least two or three fight sequences, and it’s not gonna stop until the end. So Bruce really gets out there. He really kicks some butt. His physical game, and emotional and mental game, really get trained especially in the episodes we’re nearing on now, and he becomes really a new person by the end of the season.Now, we shouldn’t expect that “new person” to have a utility belt or any mammal-related vehicles, but it appears that whatever Bruce goes through while inside the Shaman’s temple (or whatever) is going to put vengeance-embracing character through one wringer of a transition before Season 4 comes around. But at least he’ll be throwing uppercuts and leg-sweeping people while going through that wringer. After all, one of Gotham’s best fight sequences yet was Bruce’s street battle with Selina’s law-skirting colleagues, which looked a lot cleaner than a lot of Jim’s sloppy brawls. So if the show can manage to work more of those into the episodes while also upping the ante as Bruce’s training continues, then that’ll be yet another layer of enjoyment for Gotham to give fans.Viewers have gotten a taste of where his training is going, and the Shaman seems patient to wait for Bruce to just embrace it and improve without resisting. Since it’s unclear just how long Bruce will be hanging around this new and completely cut-off setting, I asked David Mazouz if we would see Bruce punching bad guys in the face back in Gotham City before the end of the season, and his answer was quite intriguing (and thankfully not as puzzling as The Riddler’s clues).All I’ll say is that he will get into some real fights. And he will take some criminals down.There are several ways to read into that, and one of them is that Bruce might not make it all the way back to his hometown this season. He’s quite a distance from it right now, and even though the show hasn’t referred to it directly, the mountains outside the Shaman’s headquarters hints at Ra’s al Ghul’s stomping grounds of Nanda Parbat, so is it possible that the League of Assassins leader will be one of the criminals Bruce takes down?"

This could describe just  about any episode of Gotham, but it’s particularly true this week. His  new place on the Court of Owls may grant him access, but he’s still out  of the loop on the details surrounding their grand scheme to destroy  Gotham. With Harvey’s assistance, Jim’s on a mission to uncover their  plans and save the city.The reveal of the Court’s plans probably won’t come  as a surprise to most people, but I’m happy enough for this to be  predictable given that it promises great drama and chaos, AND brings  back both Hugo Strange and Barnes into play. Strange, still wonderfully  eerie, is a wildcard who may find himself highly sought after by the  various factions in play.Adding to Jim’s problems is Leslie, whose  Jim-related issues have now reached the vendetta stage. Leslie is  rightfully paranoid – Jim and co. really are hiding things from her,  after all – and it’s understandable that her bitterness towards Jim  would see her interpret things in the worst possible way. However, I’m  never impressed by a storyline that involves people keeping unnecessary  secrets to manufacture drama, and it seems a waste of Morena Baccarin’s  talents to have her play the role of a Dementor in seemingly every  scene.Meanwhile, Oswald’s revenge plan has hit a speed  bump, what with Ed being AWOL. Oswald’s a smart little cookie, so he  soon makes his way to Jim’s door for the two to exchange a conversation  that’s pretty much a greatest hits compilation of their relationship:  veiled threats, requests for favours, rough grabbing, and an absence of  personal space. Welcome back, weird, compelling Jim/Oswald dynamic, I  have missed you dearly.Oswald will end the episode a) in a spot of bother  and b) with another (highly anticipated) reunion. Given the depth of  tension and emotion on show in just this brief scene, I’m really looking  forward to seeing how things play out here, and where Gotham decides to  eventually take perhaps their richest relationship. In the meantime:  reluctant, snarky team-up please, Gotham. Do it for me.Selina wasn’t looking in the best of shape last  time we saw her. Luckily Ivy, clearly now the patron saint of pint-sized  supervillains, is trying to track down her missing friend. There’s a  danger of Ivy and her plants becoming a bit of a lazy ‘deus ex machina’  here: I can just about buy Ivy managing to nurse Oswald through his  gunshot wound, but I’m rather more dubious about the critically injured  Selina. Nonetheless, I’m impressed by how the show has managed to  position this previously rather underused character as the heart of the  show. This being Gotham, I’m certain they’ll find a way to turn her into an embittered, hollow husk of herself sometime soon. Until then…enjoy it.And finally, Bruce, whose training continues. I’m  still not finding these scenes particularly scintillating, although I  have to praise the interesting stylistic choices they made for this  week’s visions. Thankfully, it seems the show is similarly bored of it:  this episode brings the first stage of Bruce’s training to a close, and –  in a welcome move – gives him back some agency in deciding his future.This week represents a great episode for Ben  McKenzie’s Jim, somebody the show has often failed to make compelling in  his own right. The other subplots feel a little more like filler, but  provide some emotional balance to the high-stakes events taking place in  Jim’s investigations." True link

With Penguin traipsing through what looks like Antarctica.What’s doing with The Shaman and Bruce? No.Does Fake Bruce admit to Catgirl that he’s only a clone? That would be telling.What’s doing with Penguin and Ivy? They’re busy putting together their army of freaks.I just watched the promo. Are they trying to recruit Firefly and Mr. Freeze? They are.What’s doing with Riddler? “RIDDLER RESURFACES,” screams the headline in the Gotham Gazette. “ROBS THREE BANKS IN ONE NIGHT!” But he’s also very curious about something Barbara Kean told him.What’s doing with Tabitha and Butch? They have differing views with regard to Barbara Kean.Can the walls of Arkham hold the hulkish Barnes? Michael Chiklis remains unseen this week.Does Falcone seek vengeance against Tetch for endangering his family? No Falcone this week either.The big news? It’s a big episode for Catgirl.What else is Fox not telling us? A couple of characters we haven’t seen this season return.Crispus Allen and Renee Montoya? No.What’s good? Cory Michael Smith as Riddler. Morena Baccarin as Leslie Thompkins. Robin Lord Taylor as The Penguin. Jessica Lucas as Tabitha. Donal Logue as Harvey Bullock. Maggie Geha as Ivy. Aubrey James, unluckiest mayor alive. The molten steel.What’s not so good? I judge this a substandard installment. Five more episodes remain after tonight; hopefully things pick up.How does it end, spoiler boy? “Welcome to the Court of Owls!”" True link

Are they an evil shadow organization out to destroy Gotham City, or are they there to help?In this week’s episode, Gordon is stuck between mourning his Uncle Frank and deciding what to do about the Court of Owls. His uncle killed himself to save Gordon, but there’s no path that doesn’t lead back to the Court. He will need to meet with them, but will he join their group? The elephant in the room is that Gordon knows Frank put the hit out on his father, sanctioned by the Court. Carmine Falcone paid for the lawyer who represented the guy who killed him. Gordon can’t deny that something is very wrong with this picture, but there’s no clear path to culpability.Clone Bruce has settled into life at Wayne Manor, but Alfred is starting to see some personality quirks that didn’t exist before in Young Master Bruce. Are these quirks the result of his shattered relationship with Selina, or is it something else? Alfred is a very smart man, but will he put the pieces together?Meanwhile, the Riddler is on a mission to become the top villain in Gotham City, but will he be successful in his quest? And will the other villains in Gotham City allow the Riddler to continue the rise to power? Ivy and Penguin are making their way back to the city and Penguin is quite happy with his new friend. They might be a formidable duo against not only the Riddler, but Barbara Keane and Tabitha." True link

He just had to murder his mentor and caretaker to get there.Actor David Mazouz, who plays the future Batman on the series, spoke with ComicBook.com about Bruce’s confrontation with Alfred Pennyworth in the season finale and that fateful moment when he plunged a sword in his chest at the behest of Ra’s Al Ghul.“That was tough,” Mazouz said. “I know that was the most emotionally difficult scene I’ve ever had to shoot on this show — maybe ever. I didn’t want to watch it when it first came out. I skipped over and then I was too curious. I went back and watched it. But I didn’t want to watch it at first because it was so emotionally- it took a lot out of me. Normally I can snap in and out of modes. If my character’s crying in a scene, I can usually get in and out of it pretty quickly. But this, it took me I think a solid day to really get out of that because Bruce is at his lowest point ever at that moment.”In most of the different mediums in which the characters appear, Alfred not only raises Bruce into the strong man he is, but he also serves as a guiding light. Mazouz took that to heart while filming that scene, and their connection helped inform his mental state while filming.“I feel like Alfred is his moral compass,” Mazouz said. “Alfred is his moral rock. It’s clear when Bruce got further from his better judgement than he’s ever been at the end of Season 3, it’s Alfred — killing Alfred — that brought him back. For Bruce, it was really, really hard. It was tough to have fake blood spurting out of Sean [Pertwee]’s chest because I love Sean. But it was a really great day and I was really happy with the final result.”Of course, dead is only a temporary state in stories like this, especially when dealing with Lazarus Pits. Alfred takes a dip in the reinvigorating pool and is later reunited with Bruce.Their conversation following that scene helps push Bruce further down the path toward becoming the infamous vigilante he’s destined to be, as evidenced by his final scene in the episode.We’ll see how stabbing Alfred in the chest affects their relationship moving forward, but the Wayne butler has always been one to let bygones be bygones. After all, he did get better." True link

After plenty of ongoing speculation, it appears that rumors about Scarecrow’s return on Gotham have been confirmed. The show’s cast announced the iconic baddie’s comeback during an appearance at Heroes & Villains Fan-Fest in Nashville. And, as expected, the Scarecrow will be full-on creepy when he makes his return.During a panel at HVFF, David Mazouz revealed the Scarecrow’s comeback with a straightforward confession.“Scarecrow comes back in season 4,” the Bruce Wayne actor said. “It’s on full blast, I’m really excited”Chiming in, Drew Powell teased fans b saying, ”It’s super creepy, too. you’re gonna love it""Reports surfaced earlier this summer about the Scarecrow’s comeback. Back in June, DC Entertainment shared a video containing cast interviews from Gotham, and Ben McKenzie let a teaser about the villain slip.“There are some villains that I’m a fan of that are in season four,” McKenzie said. “I’ve always been keen on the Scarecrow. It would be nice if the Scarecrow showed up.”Seeing McKenzie’s sly grin, fans began to speculate the Scarecrow would make a full-on comeback in Gotham’s fourth season. The show previously set up the villain as a past storyline introduced Dr. Gerald Crane, the twisted father of Scarecrow’s Jonathan Crane. The episode titled “The Scarecrow” followed Gerald as he injected his son with a so-called cure to fear, but the serum turns Jonathan insane instead. Plagued with vision of a terrifying scarecrow, Jonathan goes AWOL and hasn’t bee seen sense. That is, until next season.Gotham wasn’t going to be able to keep the whacked-out villain away for long. The Scarecrow’s return will add yet another baddie to Gotham and its villain-centric stories. Characters such as Catwoman, Harley Quinn, and even the Joker continue to be referenced in the FOX series, so it was only a matter of time until Jonathan Crane was brought back into the spotlight."

And still the finale of GothamSeason 3 showed young Bruce take his first step on the path toward brutal vigilantism when he stopped a crime while in disguise.Series star David Mazouz spoke with ComicBook.com about that scene and what it means moving toward the forthcoming fourth season of Gotham. Check out the video above!“That was one of the best moments of my life. It was amazing,” Mazouz said. “When John Stephens, our executive producer, told me about that moment we were shooting, I think, episode 10 of Season 3 and I was like, oh my god. I was just in shock and I couldn’t really process it. What I was thinking the next week or so was, ‘please don’t change it, please don’t change it, please don’t change it.’ And they didn’t — they made it even better than what he told me was going to happen. I was just so excited.”And just in case you were wondering or maybe doubting that the series would properly followup this pivotal moment — DON’T. Mazouz was more than excited about the future of the series going into Season 4.“Another thing I was worried about was we were going to get to Season 4 and the writers were going to go, ‘you know, I think we took it a little too far too fast. Let’s backtrack.’ And the exact opposite happened. The trajectory is just continuing in that direction. I would say, I would know it’s accelerating in that direction. It’s not going to stop.”But how will the series follow from that scene? Is Bruce going to start tinkering with gadgets now, or maybe learn the best bones to break without killing a criminal?Nope, the young Wayne heir is going to start separating his two lives.“Bruce really is taking on this vigilante persona and all the things that go along with that,” Mazouz said. “Whether it be creating another persona, a public persona, that’s also definitely going to be a major part of Bruce’s journey this year. His relationship as this other person. Batman is coming. Absolutely.”But with great power comes great responsibility, and Mazouz knows there are lofty expectations that come with the cape and cowl. He even admitted that he’s had some difficulty with one important aspect of playing the Dark Knight.“The tough part was finding a good Batman voice.”Maybe we’ll get to hear it when Gotham Season 4 premieres later this fall."

justgotham 162763748082 "2017-07-09 00:21:43 GMT" http://justgotham.tumblr.com/post/162763748082/camren-bicondova-nine-lives "The new epoch of women taking over as leaders and fighters is just beginning–with female Jedi, Ghostbusters, and superheroes–and Camren Bicondova is definitely a soldier of the charge. The 18-year-old may call Wonder Woman “the epitome of badassery,” but it looks like she’s doing some saving of her own–whether it’s other people on the street, or just herself, as young Catwoman a.k.a. Selina Kyle in Fox hit series Gotham. The young enigma, fluidly pickpocketing strangers and leaping up fire escapes, opens the show’s pilot set in a pre-Batman city. It kicks off right after the death of Thomas and Martha Wayne, leaving a devastated young Bruce at its wake. Selina Kyle, hidden deep in the shadows, is there as the tragedy unfolds, disappearing right after, slick as a cat in the dead of night, her disposition already showing signs of the future hero-villain to be.However, unlike the slew of famous actresses who’ve portrayed Catwoman, Camren’s Selina is someone we haven’t met before. “Nobody has seen Selina the way she is in Gotham. The street kid who depends on herself, knows how to survive on her own–they’ve only seen the regal Catwoman of the 1966 show, or the geeky assistant-turned-sexy acrobatic,” she states. Now three seasons later and a fourth on the way, she continues to tell Selina’s origin story with style and grace, edging close to finally transforming into the fierce Cat that we all love to hate, bullwhips and retractable claws hopefully included in the near future.“Dance at its core is pure feeling and genuine emotion, and that’s also what acting is.”Before all of that, the dancing military brat describes herself as being thrown into the acting world. “I was in LA for dance, and after some time wanted to try something new,” leading her to one of the most iconic characters ever known; so naturally landing the infamous Catwoman was no easy feat for Camren. Not exactly familiar with the Batman franchise before she got the part, she quickly got to reading all about the masked femme fatale, eager to bring justice to Catwoman and her character’s massive fanbase. When asked if she felt any pressure induced by the expectations of a large, passionate following, Camren admits, “When we first started filming, yes because I realized how many fans there really were, and I wasn’t quite prepared for that. But I’ve come to learn that the only real pressure comes from myself because I’m a hardcore perfectionist, so I have to be reminded not to be as hard on myself.”Three years into playing Selina Kyle, Camren’s obviously already got it covered. Well aware of her character’s individuality by now, she personally doesn’t believe in the antihero trope often labeled onto Catwoman. “Antihero is a term people use for characters who do bad in order to do good, but to me, that’s not Selina at all.” she says. “Selina is a survivor. Period. She’s not in the white area, she’s not in the black area, she’s far deep in the grey area. I feel like society puts labels on people instead of just letting them be, and I feel like Selina is part of that. She’s not a villain or an ‘antihero.’ She’s just Selina.”She’s just Selina indeed, but with a touch of her impeccable dance skills. As similar to Selina Kyle, Camren is also introverted and fiercely loyal to the ones she loves, but the cat in the woman can only be owed to Camren’s dance background. “I started dancing when I was six, but I didn’t realize that that’s what I wanted to do as a job until I was nine.” Truly a prodigy in her own right, she, along with her all-girl dance group 8 Flavahz, won first runner-up on the seventh season of America’s Best Dance Crew, and she certainly isn’t afraid to bring all that fire and flare onscreen. “Dance at its core is pure feeling and genuine emotion, and that’s also what acting is. With acting, the script provides the words of the character that the actor portrays. For dancers, the script is the song, and the character is the person singing that song, and it’s the dancer’s job to portray who the artist is and what he or she is saying through movement,” she says, breaking it down for us. “Both require deep self-understanding and emotion, and dance was my first choice of communication. So dancing definitely helped me transition into acting, and still helps me now.”In the midst of a blossoming dance career and a hit show, Camren’s unsure of what’s next for her, but she does have clear goals in mind. With all that grace and talent wrapped up in such a passionate figure, not to mention her apparent love for penning poems and screenplays, the world is her playground and we can’t wait ‘til her next adventure."

I hope that when the ending of the show is near our writers will know that, and will be able to put final characters, and not just the Joker, but of everybody.”The series has introduced plenty of villains so far, and Mazouz wants to see Gotham-centric versions of all of them before the series is over.“I feel like we’re, the show is leading up to a certain point. It’s leading up to the penguin. It’s leading up to the Riddler. It’s leading up to Batman. It’s leading up to Commissioner Gordon, and I feel like, I really hope that we’ll be able to see our versions of those characters be full blown, those characters before the show ends, and I feel like the Joker is one of those characters that really, really is crucial to the Batman lore. I think I’d be comfortable saying that he is the most important character after Batman in the Batman lore.Whether Gotham eventually says Jerome is their version of the Joker or they introduce someone else entirely, fans definitely want to see the iconic villain in some form or fashion."

I’m not going to say too much about that, but she’s definitely going to be making a leap into her evolution as Selina, as Catwoman.”With Kyle embracing her villainous tendencies, the toll will start to show sooner than later in their relationship, but that doesn’t mean they won’t form a new type of bond going forward.“Bruce and Selina’s relationship as we knew it before will really start to crumble because of certain events that happen early on in the season, but Catwoman, prototype Catwoman’s relationship with masked vigilante Bruce, that will be a different thing altogether.”Batman and Catwoman have always danced between being enemies and allies, and Gotham will start to show the beginnings of that dance in a more substantial measure this season, building towards the day that both will take up the mantles they are destined for."

While the idea of Bruce Wayne being so much younger than the majority of Batman’s most iconic villains has never really sat well with many, that hasn’t stopped Gotham from using said villains as a big draw to viewers. Witnessing the evolution of characters like Edward Nygma and Oswald Cobblepot into the dastardly Riddler and Penguin that fans know and hate to love is one of Gotham’s strongest suits, especially when watching Jim Gordon investigate the case of the week sometimes gets old.Perhaps the most intriguing villain on Gotham to date though is one that fans still aren’t 100% sure will become who it seems like he will. Batman’s most notorious foe is of course The Joker, a disfigured clown prince of crime that never seems to stay dead. That description becomes more and more applicable to Jerome Valeska (Cameron Monaghan), a psychopath who gets his kicks torturing and murdering the innocent, and has literally come back from the dead at least once.While Gotham’s creative staff remains cagey as to whether Jerome will actually become the full-fledged Joker or not, his presence is still always a welcome shot in the arm to each Gotham season, turning the status quo upside down in hideously delightful ways. However, unlike Gotham’s other resident villains, Jerome never seems to stick around more than a handful of episodes at a time. Will Jerome ever become a full-time Gotham bad guy? It’s unlikely, at least according to Gotham star Drew Powell, who said the following (via Cinema Blend):“I feel like Jerome is a solo artist. He’s not one to team up with anyone. Early on he had his Maniax, but I think the evolution of that character is he’s a unique psychopath/sociopath, both. So I don’t see any teaming up with Jerome.That’s part of the deal with him which was interesting; how they kind of had a Jerome section in the middle of our season. And part of that is the actor has another job [on Shameless], and the other part is that character is intense. 22 episodes is a lot of TV… So those characters that are super intense… you can’t use them all the time or it stresses people out. So yeah, I think when Jerome comes, it’s all about Jerome.”Powell of course knows something about being a Gotham villain, having portrayed hulking brute Butch Gilzean since the beginning of the series, and worked alongside most of the other villains in town at one point or another. While Butch met his seeming end in the season 3 finale, his birth name was also revealed to be Cyrus Gold, aka Solomon Grundy. With that in mind, it looks like Jerome soon won’t be the only bad guy unable to be held down by a little inconvenience called death, when Gotham season 4 airs.His overall point regarding Jerome is quite sound though, and it wouldn’t at all be surprising to hear Powell’s sentiments echoed by Gotham’s writers and producers. Jerome is such a force of nature whenever he shows up that it almost makes everything else going on in the city look trivial by comparison, making it hard to focus on anything but his latest killing spree. At the same time, the mystery behind whether or not he’s actually The Joker also gets harder to maintain the more screen time he receives. Thus, Jerome fans hoping he’ll become a series regular anytime soon are probably out of luck." True link

Believing the phenomena to be the symptom of something much larger, his obsession eventually leads him to question reality itself.The name of the theory originated from blogger Fiona Broome, in reference to sharing a false memory of South African human rights activist Nelson Mandela dying while imprisoned in the ’80s, when in actuality he passed away in December 2013.Joshua Fruehling, Levy and Schlachtenhaufen are producing.Hofheimer, repped by Paradigm and Forward Entertainment, most recently starred in Fox’s 24: Legacy and appeared in Easy Living which made its world premiere at this year’s SXSW.

However, that’s about to change if the first casting rumor of the season turns out to be true!In scrolling through the credits for the first episode of Gotham‘s fourth season cast listings on  IMDB, one will notice that Blue Bloods alum Harry Sutton Jr. is currently credited as appearing in the first episode of the season as a character titled simply as “GCPD Commissioner.” Should Sutton Jr. indeed join the cast, he’ll finally give a face to the latest Commissioner for the force and the timing is definitely perfect for the character to reemerge. As fan will recall, the city of Gotham was sent into a state of emergency after the Tetch Virus was unleashed upon its residents and it’s clear that the early part of – if not the entire – Season 4 will be spent focusing on the aftermath of the incident. With the city likely still in the recovery process, the GCPD Commissioner would definitely have his hands filled in overseeing the GCPD’s efforts to clean the city up – presuming he’s one of the good guys and not like former Commissioner Loeb."

The tv show, Gotham, sent its set decorator out to find appropriately ominous lighting for upcoming episodes of its show on Fox. I’m proud to say she has ordered two ceiling lights from Jerry Riekert (Jerry the Lamp Builder). If there are any fans of the show, keep a look out for these lamps in upcoming episodes and please do let me know if you see them! I will be watching the show as well and would love to talk to anyone who is interested in Gotham. Furthermore, thank you to all who support me and follow me on social media.

justgotham 162097707157 "2017-06-21 21:12:03 GMT" http://justgotham.tumblr.com/post/162097707157/screen-test-maggie-geha-anthem-magazine "It’s a beloved DC comics supervillain that made a huge resurgence in 90s pop culture with peak Uma Thurman and Joel Schumacher’s oh-so-campy! Batman & Robin. She’s Poison Ivy, a Gotham City botanist who moonlights as the most seductive eco-terrorist the world has ever seen.One exciting creative decision made by FOX on Gotham’s just-wrapped third season was the abrupt aging up of Ivy Pepper—renamed for the series, in a departure from her comic book alter ego Pamela Lillian Isley—in the premiere episode, setting the stage for the orphan girl’s gradual transformation into the villainess Poison Ivy we’re all familiar with. In what’s lovingly referred to as “SORASed” (Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome) in the world of daytime television, 15-year-old actress Clare Foley bowed out with 28-year-old newcomer Maggie Geha assuming the mantle.Geha’s career is still very much on the up and up. After getting her start in the business as a recurring guest star on the soap All My Children and featured roles on 30 Rock, in Beyoncé’s “Pretty Hurts” video—she’s also a model, duh—and Ted 2, Gotham is her biggest score to date.Anthem met up with Geha for an intimate photoshoot in New York last week in advance to our interview. In the kind of rewarding chat where we know very little about the person going in, we sit down with the actress to discuss her early days, the big career lessons, and season four of Gotham.Gotham returns for season four with its premiere episode “Pax Penguina” this fall.To start, tell me about this table read you were at today.So I just got back from the table read for Gotham season four, episode one, which is very exciting. We start shooting the very first episode tomorrow. The gang’s all back together. We had a great hiatus. I think everybody was really happy to see each other and get the new season underway.It must be a different feeling coming back to a show as opposed to starting on it fresh.Yeah! It kinda felt like coming back from school vacation and seeing all of your friends on the first day. I look forward to seeing how the writers evolve Ivy’s character for season four.Do you have a pretty good sense as to what your character arc will be this new season?You know—I think that varies per character, per show. In my experience, it’s always a different story. I didn’t know too much going into season three. Occasionally, you’ll get bits of information from a producer here and a writer there. I think that’s because it’s very much a collaborative effort. I mean, obviously, there’s a method to the madness. Some of it’s like, we’re all trying to figure it out as we go along. So I don’t know anything at all about what’s going to happen in season four—for Ivy, at least. I’m just kinda figuring it out as we all get the scripts.I would think not knowing where it’s going leaves room for both anxiety and excitement.Totally, yes. It’s mostly excitement for sure. It’s just really fun getting the scripts and being surprised to find out what happens. And then it’s like, “Oh my god, I can’t believe I actually get to do this.” You read it on the page, we do the table read out loud, and for a lot of us, it’s the first time we’re finding out about things that happen. It’s just exciting!The scope of TV is obviously so big nowadays. There’s so much good stuff out there. Does it feel like you’re shooting a really long movie when you’re on a show like Gotham?[Laughs] Yeah! Well, we have 22 episodes in each season. That’s a long season, with a pretty short hiatus. I think Gotham is very cinematic. It’s shot like a beautiful film. So yeah, in some sense, it does feel like an extra long film, which is nice! You just have a little longer to enjoy it.You were on All My Children and soaps are very fast-paced. Gotham must be very different.Oh yeah, very different. I have endless respect for actors that work on soaps. I only worked very briefly, but I can tell you that those actors probably work harder than anybody else in the business in terms of how fast-paced it is. Their memorization muscles must be really strong because they learn all their lines and then immediately shoot them. You get one, two takes—tops. For Gotham, we shoot smaller sections, we have to know less lines day of, and we get several takes. And on a movie—usually, depending on the schedule—you get even more takes and even more time.How did you get Gotham? Did you go through a traditional auditioning process?Yeah! I was out in L.A. for a couple years just auditioning. I also moved out there for a change of scenery from New York. I got the self tape [audition] request from my agent, so I just put myself on tape in my living room and that was pretty much it. I met with the casting department at FOX in L.A. I went into their office and had a meeting. Essentially—they actually said this—the meeting was just to make sure that I was a real person and looked the same as I do on tape. [Laughs] And that was it. There was a little bit of a waiting period and then I got the call nine o’clock at night from my team that I got the job. About a week later, it was back to New York to start working.It’s crazy what Marvel and DC has become in our culture. It was big when I was growing up, but in the ways of cartoons and action figures. The live action stuff we get now—to this extent—were really unthinkable. The fanbase for Gotham must be pretty intense.Oh yeah, it really is. One of the nice things about being a part of the comic book world now is that, as actors, we get to go to these awesome conventions where we get to meet fans of the show that we’re on. And not just the shows, but also comic books in general. We get to meet die-hard comic book fans. They dress up in these incredible cosplay outfits. The whole comic book world is fairly new to me and I just find it fascinating. It’s amazing to meet the fans because they’re incredibly loyal and some of the sweetest people I’ve ever met, honestly.So you’re going back to work on Gotham tomorrow. What’s the shooting schedule like?We wrapped season three at the end of March, so we were off in April, May, and part of June. We pretty much shoot all year. We have two-and-a-half months off, basically.How do you like to manage your day-to-day, given the erratic nature of an actor’s life?That’s one of the hard parts, at least for me. I can’t really speak for other actors. It really depends on what project you’re working on. For Gotham, it’s an ensemble cast and there’s 15 series regulars so there’s a lot of us. It’s not like every single one of us is working every single day. It depends on your role, where your character is in the storyline, and what they’re exploring at the moment. I personally did have a lot of downtime, so it is important to sort of structure your day and make sure you use your downtime wisely. It’s tricky not having structure in your day—a nine to five or something like that—because you can find yourself becoming lazy or unproductive or twiddling your thumbs not knowing what to do with yourself. But I think it’s something that you get used to as an actor. You do learn how to structure your own day and be your own boss, basically. I mean, I fill my time with other creative endeavors like auditioning for other smaller roles if I can do them outside of Gotham. Friends, family… Trying to make myself a better person… [Laughs] Studying, working on your craft, always trying to learn and grow and be better… With these conventions that we do, we have to travel and stuff like that. There’s stuff to do outside the actual shoot. Even today, there was the table read. We have fittings and stuff like that.What one big realization have you made while working in the industry?That there’s no limit to what you can achieve in life. Growing up, for some reason—I don’t know why or where I got this from, and I don’t blame my parents or my upbringing—I had an inferiority complex. Like I said before, I didn’t think becoming an actor was an attainable goal for me. It sounds cliché, but going through my career thus far, it has taught me that the sky’s the limit. A dream that might seem out of reach really isn’t. You just have to take risks and work hard and be patient. Anything is possible. I’m throwing around clichés, but that’s the biggest thing that being in this business has taught me. You can do whatever you want to do if you put your mind to it. There’s no reason to assume that something’s out of your reach.All clichés are born out of truth—including what I just said.If you had told 13-year-old Maggie that she would be playing Poison Ivy on FOX with Warner Brothers, I never would’ve believed you. I would’ve laughed at you because, at that point in my life, I just couldn’t imagine that I could actually do something like that. We can really do anything we want, anything that we set our minds to, as long as we work hard and believe that it can happen.What kind of roles, stories, and genres do you hope to explore going beyond Poison Ivy?Well, I love this question because I’m at the beginning of my career and I feel like I’m sort of a newbie. [Gotham] is my first television role as a series regular, so I have pretty much everything else in front of me to do. I would love to do something involving my musicality. I love to sing and I love music. I also love dancing and grew up with it. I would be head-over-heels excited to do something like La La Land. I’ve always wanted to do a Western. I would love for my work to allow me to travel. I would love to do a period piece, more than one period piece—every period piece. I would love to do a good comedy where I can play a weird supporting character, kinda like Melissa McCarthy in Bridesmaids. I also love sci-fi: Alien, stunts, fighting… I would love to do something “badassery” à la Wonder Woman. I definitely don’t limit myself to one type of genre or character. I can only hope that my career will bring a whole lot of versatility, and help me to grow and challenge and stretch myself as an actor. I can’t think of too many things I’d turn down.I have a lot of respect for actors because so much is at stake for the individual. It could all go so wrong. There’s compulsion to it. For a lot of actors, they have to do it.Totally. So much of our job is dealing with rejection, too. You and I both, man. I also have a lot of respect for actors. I ask myself this constantly: “How… Why am I doing this?” [Laughs] It can be maddening being an actor. But like I said, I think it’s just embracing the fact that whatever role that’s right for you is gonna come your way as long as you put in the hard work. That’s what I always tell other actors. If you give up, you’re never going to work. Don’t give up." True link

Well, at the very least, we’ll get to watch more of it unfold, because Gotham Season 4 will happen in 2017.While we know Gotham Season 4 is definitely happening, we have few details at the moment of when we can hope to see Bruce, Jim, and the rest of the gang back on our TV screens again. The current season of Gotham put a renewed focus on famous Batman villains, while adding more to the fold. We’ve had the Court of Owls mystery unfolding, Edward Nygma finally going all out with his green suit and Riddler identity, the continued ascendance of Robin Lord Taylor’s Oswald Cobblepot, and the most serious teases yet about the identity of the Joker.Add to this the revelation of Ra’s al Ghul, which was teased in the two-hour Season 3 finale with the promise of more to come, and Gotham is looking less like a Batman prequel and more like, well, a Batman TV series.We’re not there yet, though, and for fans, they have at least one more year to enjoy the ride.Gotham Season 4 VillainsWhile it’s too early to say for sure, it does look like we’ll get this world’s version of Solomon Grundy, more Ra’s al Ghul, and perhaps the long promised Harley Quinn. But in an interview with DC All Access, Ben McKenzie indicates he’d like to see the Scarecrow again, a character who hasn’t been seen since season one.Gotham Season 4 Release DateGotham Season 4 is moving to Thursday nights.

Jim – battling to retain his humanity with the virus coursing through his veins – is understandably particularly desperate, especially with Leslie on his mind.Last week, although impressed that Gotham let Jim infect himself, I doubted that the show would let Jim fully fall into darkness. Here, we see a pretty explicit battle for Jim’s soul – will he let himself embrace his virus self to win back Lee, or will his ‘goodness’ win out? This being Gotham, the answer is somewhere in the middle, which suits me just fine.Bruce’s dull storyline comes to a dramatic end, as he drifts his ways towards destiny… and Ra’s Al Ghul. What we get here from Alexander Siddig’s Ra’s Al Ghul is more of a taster than anything else, but it’s certainly promising for further appearances. The man oozes charisma and menace. If he and his League of Shadows are our season four ‘big bad’, I’m excited.Disclaimer: your reviewer has a wild crush on Alexander Siddig, so I wouldn’t expect impartiality on the topic.For Bruce, the short, sharp shock of his actions in the finale will have lasting emotional fallout for him. It’s been frustrating to watch his meek compliance in the past few weeks and that compliance shows itself here in the most horrifying of ways.Elsewhere, tensions between Oswald, Ed and team Barbara finally come to a head in an explosion of betrayal and brutality.To be honest, it’s a little sad to see that there’s not a shred of affection left between the two former BFF’s. For Ed, Oswald has now become a murderous obsession. We know that Ed is single-minded, and that’s never been clearer than in this finale, as his fixation drives him to forge on with his own plans at the expense of his own allies.Who’ll win the final showdown back at the docks? Perhaps fittingly given their shared history, it all comes down to who better understands what makes the other tick.Barbara has spent this back half of the season pursuing power and testing the loyalty of her former paramour Tabitha in the process. What’s the line in the sand for Tabitha? We find out here, as Barbara burns her bridges in a major way. The path for both is now unclear, although I’m intrigued by perennial follower Tabs potentially taking on a mentor role for the aimless Selina.Meanwhile, Gotham is also busy leaving tantalizing things for the new season to come: the Iceberg lounge! Solomon Grundy! Bruce doing his Batman thing!This being Gotham – which tends to have at least 40,000 plot points in the air at once – there are a few frustrating loose ends. Where’s clone Bruce? Where’s Barnes? Was Isabella really just a piece of lazy writing? I admire the show’s ambition for this finale, so I’m less inclined to whinge about these irritating threads than I might be normally. Just… please calm down, Gotham. Sometimes less is more.Oh, and we have a Lazarus pit now. Everybody will be even less permanently dead than they were before. Although you may all be glad of that, for one week at least…" True link
