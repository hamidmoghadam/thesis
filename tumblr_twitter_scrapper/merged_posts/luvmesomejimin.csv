However, it will be a slow process and may take a couple of weeks or months to get back into a regular schedule. I will try and focus on my main blog (@luvmesomejimin) and will be posting mostly on there for the time being. Over these past few months, I have learned how to be more professional with my posts and am excited to share a new content series (under construction) soon! My old posts were so unorganized and sloppy [I’m highly considering redo-ing almost all of them..cuz damn ;-;]   Hopefully, I will be back to posting better quality content on a daily basis, soon. Also, thank you to those who have still followed my blogs even though I was gone for so long TT. You guys are the MVPS 😭💜" True text
