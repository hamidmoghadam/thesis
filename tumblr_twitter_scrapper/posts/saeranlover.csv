Unfortunately, I’m flat-out exhausted because it was my first day back in work today after… what happened…. and it was really hot today too… so I won’t be finishing it today….Zen had been able to control some of the water, to create a path in the sand back to the main beach. Your clothes were drenched still, and you honestly wouldn’t be surprised if you ended up ill after this. In the distance, you could see what seemed to be search parties… God, the rest of the RFA must have been really worried about you…Eventually, you heard your name be yelled out, before you felt something warm wrapped around your body. “Oh my God, you’re okay! We’ve been really worried!” It took you a moment to realise that it was Saeyoung, and it was a dark green coloured hoodie of his which had been put over your shoulders. “You… You are okay, right…? Ah, forget that, I need to call the others! We’ve even had our robot of a corporate heir crying because you fell into the ocean right in front of him!”You remained silent for a moment as Saeyoung put his arm around you and started calling somebody. But when he had hung up, and said that the rest of the RFA were on their way…“Saeyoung… He’s real… Zen, the siren… he’s real…”“That silly story…? Maybe you’ve got a bad fever… M- Maybe we should t- take you to hospital-!”“He’s real! I swear, he is!” Saeyoung flinched as you shouted, before you looked out to the ocean. You could see him just about, standing with a concerned look on his face. Saeyoung followed your line of sight, before sighing. “No, he…” Then Saeyoung fell silent. “MC… Why am I seeing a naked, white-haired guy standing in the ocean?”" True text
