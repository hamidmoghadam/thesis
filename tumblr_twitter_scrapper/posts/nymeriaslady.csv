Nobody knows how to handle it because he’s supposed to be there learning magic but you know what, it fucking works. Give me Harry Potter who is like fucking MacGuyver up in this shit, creating his own non-magical solutions to magical problems. “Potter how did you get past the enchanted keys to the Sorcerer’s Stone?” “I used a fucking net.”  “How did you get past the dragon?” Harry shines a little red light on the wall “works on cats, why not a dragon” “How did you get through the hedge maze?”  “Weed-b-gone, it’s like a pound. Nothing will ever grow there again”  It’s the final battle between Harry and Voldemort. The Dark Lord begins to prepare a spell to end Harry Potter’s life once and for all when….

He talk to the grave of Liza Hempstock about the life he has lived, until the day he himself die. When finally meeting the Grey Lady he know just where he want to go. This is a sweet fanfic, and I like the idea as well. I was always convinced that Nobody would choose to return to the graveyard, and the end and the way he finally was buried in (don’t want to spoil it for you!) felt very fitting. The language is good, and as previously stated I’m very fond of the ending and how the author handled that part, and I mean not only the plot but also the way it was written. The characterization is really good, and I can’t help but smile as I read the dialog between Nobody and Liza.
