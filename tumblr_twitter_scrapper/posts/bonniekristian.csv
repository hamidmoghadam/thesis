As you hopefully recall, I’m working on my first book right now. It’s    very accessible theology project exploring the breadth of Christian orthodoxy and orthopraxy, both historically and in the church today—which basically means it’s designed to answer the question, “What’s the deal with all these different kinds of Christians?”Part of the book will be a series of brief interviews introducing readers to Christians whose commitment to follow Jesus looks significantly different from that of the average American churchgoer. The concept is not just people with unusual theologies (that’s more the territory of other parts of the book), but significantly unusual daily expressions or habits of their faith. That’s inevitably something of an arbitrary distinction, I realize, but it’s why a Messianic Jew, a member of a common purse community, a Franciscan brother, and a racial reconciler all make the cut, but a Calvinist or a Baptist wouldn’t.So this is where you come in: What type(s) of Christian would you like to see in these interviews? What sort of Christian have you looked at and wondered, “What are they about and why do they live like that?”—but never had the opportunity to ask?I’m aiming for 17-19 interviews, currently have about 15 planned, and would love to get your suggestions to fill in those last few spots. Maybe there’s some category that just happens to be familiar to me but is super unfamiliar to most people? You don’t have to suggest a specific person—I’ll do that legwork—just a general category.So, whatcha got?" True text

There was no 24-hour, days long cable news barrage about it. There were no hashtags, social media campaigns or protests. The pain was just as real for those suffering, but the coverage and popular reaction were almost nonexistent.So many of those outraged right now — and rightly — generally liked Obama. They trusted him. Now, similarly, Trump supporters will defend this president’s actions, no matter how much harm he causes, because they like and trust him too.But shouldn’t other people’s pain come before partisanship? Should Alexander Gutierrez Garcia and Abu Hassan matter less than Hameed Khalid Darweesh?Shouldn’t lending our moral support or outrage be based on something more than merely what presidents we like?” — Jack Hunter, “Where was the outrage where Obama was hurting innocent foreigners?”“Of the seven countries in Trump’s ban, the U.S. military is operating in all but one of them. The U.S. knocked over the governments of Iraq and Libya, creating instability and sectarian conflict across the region, including in Syria. The U.S. now bombs all three of those countries in an attempt to manage their internal political turmoil. In Yemen, the U.S. is a party to Saudi Arabia’s unjust and hopeless war there, providing weapons, logistical support, and even help with refueling airplanes and targeting. The U.S. is even conducting a shadow war in Somalia. Surely if Muslim lives matter, they matter when they are being bombed by our planes, or when their country is being ripped apart by our proxies, or starved by the blockades we assist. These policies wreck many more Muslim lives than Trump’s executive order.” — Michael Brendan Dougherty, “Where was the liberal uproar over Obama’s Middle East wars?”On Friday, President Trump signed his executive order suspending immigration and travel from six countries (Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Libya, Yemen, and Somalia) for three months and one country (Syria) indefinitely. The same order also suspended all refugee admissions to the United States for four months (again, Syria indefinitely) and indicated that minority religious groups in these nations (all of which are Muslim-majority) would be given preference when refugee admissions resumed.Since then, uproar over Trump’s order has been incessant, and rightly so. This order is inhumane, irrational, and ill-conceived. It egregiously flouts the rule of law and, particularly for those who were detained and/or turned away from U.S. airports over the weekend despite their possession of legitimate travel papers, is a denial of due process. And whatever Trump says about this not being the “Muslim ban” — honestly, that suggests to me the worrying possibility that he has some other, more onerous ban in mind — the president’s own comments, the comments of his allies, and the order’s preference for religious minorities in majority-Muslim countries all say otherwise.As thousands of protesters have amassed at airports and in Washington, many civil libertarians have noted that these newly minted political activists were largely silent during abuses of the Obama administration which, while not identical to this Trump order, deserve to be placed in the same general category. Above I’ve quoted two examples of this argument, one from my editor at Rare, Jack Hunter, and one from my colleague at The Week, Michael Brendan Dougherty.Both are dead on, and their point about consistency over partisanship cannot be heard enough.However, I’ve also increasingly run across criticisms of those using executive order outrage to make the consistency argument. We civil libertarians might be technically right, the critics contend, but we’re being unnecessarily divisive at a time when unity against Trumpian power grabs and constitutional breaches should be our top and single political priority.Here’s the thing: In some cases, what’s going on is more about schadenfreude than a principled case for consistency. And schadenfreude, not to put to fine a point on it, is a jerk move. In fact, I feel pretty comfortable saying it’s a sin. A vice. There’s a lot of talk about decency right now, and decent people do not rejoice in their enemies’ misfortune, even when they are political enemies whose anger we believe to be hypocritical and short-sighted.But I don’t think what Jack and MBD are doing in the quotes above is schadenfreude. Rather, as Rep. Justin Amash — one of a very short list of Republicans who have publicly opposed Trump’s order — wrote on Twitter, “Admitting that both parties routinely ignore the Constitution, reject the Rule of Law, and erode liberty is the first step to recovery…If you can’t accept both sides have been disastrous, then don’t expect things to get better.”  So to all the people who are protesting civil liberties abuses for the first time right now: Thank you. Keep doing what you’re doing. I hope to see your outrage extended to include the state of the war on terror more broadly. I hope your mobilization makes the protests of the invasion of Iraq back in 2003 look like child’s play.But — and this is key — I also hope you remember that a lot of what Trump is doing is not as new as it feels, and that the groundwork that made much of this possible was laid by a guy you may have liked. In short, remember that the presidency needs institutional, not individual, change. Its power needs to be massively curtailed, even when guys we might like more than Trump are in office. If we can’t get a consistent perspective that acknowledges everything that happened before Jan. 20, 2017, all the protests may as well shut down now.A version of this piece is published here at Rare."

Trump’s treatment of women, the 24-year-old continued, “doesn’t impact border security, national security, trade, jobs, spending or anything else that impacts your daily life. No! But same cannot be said about Hillary’s dream of open trade and open borders.” […]  Falwell Jr. argues, like Lahren, that Trump’s good policies outweigh his bad character. “Our country is gonna suffer if we get sidetracked on these rabbit trails about is this person a good person, is that person a good person,” he has said. “It’s not about that. It’s about what are their positions on the issues.”  I don’t want to overgeneralize here, or to suggest this is purely a power-motivated calculation (though in many cases I believe that’s the primary, if subconscious, motivation). Nevertheless, it has happened, and it is not a minor change.I’ve argued that as much as policy matters, character matters too—and, in fact, a president of poor character would probably lack the integrity to stick to their good promises or, if they didn’t outright abandon the principles of their campaign, they’d lack the discipline to push their ideas through the morass of Washington.Today, I was thinking about this subject again because I read this list of 51 things Trump has said about women. It’s awful. Even if you excuse the more explicit stuff as “locker room talk” (I don’t, but say you do), the less explicit is just as bad. For instance: “Women have one of the great acts of all time” — as if half the human race is solely engaged in manipulation at every moment, accomplishing everything we do through deception rather than ability.Now, one of the unusual things of being a libertarian is that we have fairly few (or, for some, zero) politicians with whom we’re really willing to throw in our lot. It’s so unusual to have someone who closely aligns with our views that the feeling of significant enthusiasm over a public figure is mostly foreign.  So here’s my question and the point of this post: Imagine a candidate who is 100% aligned with your views and also has Trump’s exact personal character. For the sake of argument, because it is policy-adjacent, let’s say the hypothetical candidate doesn’t have Trump’s personal history of eminent domain obsession and abuse, bankruptcy, etc. (I realize some will want to argue Trump’s specific character flaws are incompatible with their political views, but try to imagine an analogous situation for the sake of the thought experiment.)Would you support them?"

They were fighting for equal rights of political expression, and intentional abstention from the electoral process fits that bill as well as voting does.Voting is not inherently moral. More than once the ballot box has been the means of a dictator’s rise.Abstention is not inherently apathetic. In fact, there have even been abstention campaigns in which people withheld votes to indict a political system whose flaws extended well past a single party or candidate.Voting for a third-party or write-in candidate or writing something like “none of the above” is not necessarily more moral or effective than total abstention. Yes, abstention can be misinterpreted as apathy, but is does not risk misinterpretation as acceptance of the whole electoral structure, which those other options do chance.Refusing to vote for one candidate does not mean supporting their opponent. That is a logically fallacious guilt trip.Voting is not the solution to our problems. That’s not to say it never helps, but politics is no panacea, and there are many problems it can’t fix.  Voting can become an excuse for avoiding work to actually address those problems. More on that here.Look, I know the importance of voting (and specifically, voting for a viable candidate) is drilled into us from kindergarten on up by people we admire and respect. That voting is an obligation and refusing to vote at the very least a sign of poor character is well-ingrained in the American psyche. There are good and understandable historical reasons why voting so revered in the United States, but those reasons do not make these assumptions correct. If there was ever a time for critical thinking about whether and how to vote, 2016 is it. I encourage you to use that opportunity well. Maybe you’ll still end up voting—maybe even for one of the major party choices. Fine. But don’t do it on autopilot. Don’t do it because you think it’s your duty as an American to pull the lever for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. Nothing could be farther from the truth." True text

Since NYC’s stop-and-frisk was officially shut down, crime rates actually dropped in the city, and even while the program was still running, there was no real correlation between the number of stops and the number of crimes.[Also] stop-and-frisk is unconstitutional. It’s a clear violation of the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable, warrantless search and seizure. There’s actually a Twitter account that shares real quotes from NYC stop-and-frisk reports showing the incredibly flimsy reasons officers gave for stopping people without cause. The number of innocent New Yorkers stopped for something as vague as “furtive movements,” “wearing clothes commonly used in a crime,” or even just “other” behavior is mind-boggling. With reasons like that, literally anything is a pretext for harassment and literally anyone can be harassed.More here.In short: You’re right about the Fourth Amendment violation but incorrect about the affect on crime rates."

My thoughts were much along the lines of this Relevant article I wrote recently, in which I argued that no one can be knowledgeably angry at every injustice or outrage—nor should we try to be. You have to choose your battles, so to speak.From there the subject turned to Donald Trump, and specifically this piece from Vox: “Donald Trump gave an interview this morning that should be shocking—but we’re numb.” Here’s a representative excerpt, which is reflecting in response to a Trump TV appearance in which he lied about investing in the stockmarket and called Sen. Elizabeth Warren “Pocahontas”:— In a normal election cycle, a candidate making an offhand racist remark about a sitting US senator would be a big news story.—   In a normal election cycle, a candidate making an offhanded lie about the state of his personal finances would be a big news story.—   To be totally honest, even in a normal election cycle a candidate exhibiting total confusion about the mechanics and merits of monetary policy probably wouldn’t be that big of a news story but it would at least get some attention.Seriously. Stop. Take a breath. Now imagine if Mitt Romney had run exactly Mitt Romney’s campaign but then suddenly in mid-September went on television and called Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas for no reason. It would have been huge.This year, basically nothing. Trump being kinda racist is a dog-bites-man story.The takeaway here, one of my friends suggested, is that Trumpism is becoming normal. Casually throwing around dishonest or racist remarks is becoming acceptable in our society in a way it wasn’t, say, in 2014. We should be upset when we hear this stuff, but we’re not anymore, because we’ve become acclimatized to it after a year and a half of incessant exposure.I don’t think that’s true—but then, it’s hard to gauge something like this based on personal experience. Maybe I’m just in my little Mennonite/Libertarian/Minnesota bubble and I’m missing big changes because they’re not happening in my own social circles.Still, I’m inclined to think broad normalization is not what’s happening here. Yes, there’s a degree to which we’ve all become inured to Trump’s antics. They still make news, but one’s reservoir of shock is hardly endless and, again, we’ve been at this for a year and a half. Think about anyone daily for a year and a half and you’ll come to expect them to do the things they habitually do. Expecting Trump to be Trump does not mean extending that expectation to other people.But what do you all think? Has Trumpism become normal? Did Trump normalize his own outrageous behavior for anyone but himself?" True text

But unlike Tammany Hall, he doesn’t exactly deliver. Thus, for example, his religious liberty executive order from last week. This EO changed just about nothing—seriously, it’s so toothless the ACLU decided not to bother challenging it in court.That Trump has done nothing of substance to enhance freedom of conscience protections hasn’t stopped evangelical leaders from singing his praises, because he continues to make them feel heard. Trump promised to “fight for” evangelicals, to look out for him the way Tammany Hall looked out for immigrants. That feeling of protection and access is enough for Liberty University’s Jerry Falwell Jr. to declare Trump the “dream president.”To put my cards on the table, I was raised among the very white evangelicals who are now so enthusiastic about Trump. I do not share any of their enthusiasm because of the president’s policy and personal character alike.And even though I understand why Trump’s Tammany-style promises appeal, I am disappointed and worried to see my fellow Christians putting their “trust in princes,” as Psalm 146 phrases it, “in human beings, who cannot save.”Donald Trump is not savior of the American church, and it is troubling how many of my fellow Christians are so eager to rely on his (politically impotent) blessings.

It gives officers strategies to more calmly deal with people who are experiencing mental and emotional crises.There are 34 states that do not require de-escalation training for all officers, according to an analysis by APM Reports, and only eight have done so since [Mike] Brown was killed three years ago. As of February, Georgia requires one hour per year of de-escalation training.Though most states have boards that license peace officers and oversee state training requirements — boards with the power to require the training — the vast majority have failed to mandate it.That has left the decision of whether to train up to local chiefs and sheriffs. And many haven’t done it, citing, among other reasons, cost, lack of staff, and a belief that the training is unnecessary or constitutes a rebuke of traditional policing.Without statewide mandates, officer training in de-escalation varies widely from one police jurisdiction to the next, even within one metropolitan area. The inconsistency creates the troubling reality that a mentally-ill person … could be at a higher risk of being killed by police simply by traveling between cities." True link

An excerpt:However this plays out, these two latest high-profile police misconduct cases make two things clear.First, that body cameras helped. They didn’t prevent these cases from happening, but they did pull them kicking and screaming into the light of day.In Michigan, we would never have heard about what happened to those boys without video of their encounter. It would just have been the kids’ and moms’ word against that of the police. Absent footage, this militarized treatment of children almost certainly would not have come to light.In Dallas, the police claimed the car Jordan was in was charging officers, making the shooting a defensive response. Video proved that wasn’t true. Whether you believe the original story was an honest mistake or a deliberate lie, knowing the truth makes a world of difference.It is difficult to contemplate what happens in all the other cases, all the ones without video.The second thing to note is that this problem has not gone away. There is much competing for our political attention right now, but police brutality and criminal justice reform, including the indisputable role of race, cannot be neglected. It is often a discouraging and draining topic — I would be happy if I could never write about another Eric Garner, another Philando Castile, another Walter Scott.But until a lot changes, there will be another, as Jordan Edwards’ family now knows all too well.Read the rest here."

The rhetoric is anti-empire. Jesus is Lord, Caesar is not.But in practice, the political theology of many progressive Christians is Niebuhrian. That is, Christians must take and use the power of the state to address our social and international problems. The focus is upon electoral politics and democratic engagement: voting, calling Congress, etc. Jesus may be Lord, but in this unjust world Caesar is how we get stuff done. That’s Niebuhrian realism.In short, it seems to be that a lot of progressive Christians want to be Anabaptist and Niebuhrian at the same time. Or adjust our position when it suits us. Anti-empire when you need to denounce an administration. Niebuhrian when you need to win an election.   I’ve observed this dynamic in action with some frequency, and this succinct critique   —  which I am glad to see coming from a progressive Christian   — strikes me as spot-on.

An excerpt:To be sure, these are not wars of Trump’s initiation. From former Presidents Bush and Obama he inherited U.S. military interventions of varying cost and quality in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen. It would be unfair to expect resolution overnight.But these fights are now unquestionably wars of Trump’s escalation, soon in Libya and Somalia and already in at least Syria and Yemen. Several hundred Marines and Army Rangers have been deployed to the battle for Raqqa, the first time the United States has placed ground troops — as opposed to Special Operations Forces (SOFs) ostensibly performing an advisory role — into outright combat in Syria. And as The New York Times reported, the Trump administration launched more airstrikes in Yemen in March alone than the Obama administration ordered in all of 2016.While Washington hawks might argue this is simply evidence of Trump waging the war on terror with an energy Obama lacked, that suggestion cannot hold water. The Obama administration dropped more than 26,000 bombs in these seven countries in 2016, an increase of more than 3,000 over the prior year. He, too, was escalating U.S. intervention in an attempt to settle internal political disputes in distant countries. In fact, at Obama’s direction, our military was quite literally dropping bombs faster than they could be produced.It is only by comparison to the heights of hysterical saber-rattling among the Washington establishment that Obama can be cast as inactive in foreign policy. His is the ignominious legacy of the only American president to preside over two full terms of war, and it is precisely that legacy—crafted as it was with the reckless prodding of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton — which Trump’s candidacy often critiqued.No, this is a not a story of Obama’s pacifism and Trump’s power. It is a story of presidents past entangling the United States in costly, risky interventions with no endgame or defined strategy—and of Trump so far deciding to do the same thing, but more.Read the rest here."

The council of Nicaea is best known for the profession of faith – the ‘Nicene Creed’ – which is still recited in most parishes every Sunday immediately after the sermon. However, the council also issued twenty canons of a practical nature, dealing with various aspects of church life, and the fifth of these canons speaks of Lent.The word used for Lent in this fifth canon is tessarakonta (in the original Greek), which means ‘forty’. For the first time in recorded history, we have mention of this period of preparation for Easter as lasting forty days. Much earlier, Christians had introduced Easter Sunday to celebrate Christ’s resurrection. Soon afterwards, a period of two or three days preparation, specially commemorating Christ’s passion and death – the ‘Holy Week’ part of Lent today – had been adopted by various Christian communities. But the first mention of a preparatory period lasting the forty days comes from this fifth canon of Nicaea.The length of time was adopted in imitation of the forty days that Jesus spent in the desert at the beginning of his public ministry:“Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. He fasted forty days and forty nights and afterwards he was famished.” (Matthew 4:1-2)In many languages the word for Lent implies ‘forty’: Quaresima deriving from quaranta (forty) in Italian; Cuaresma coming from cuarenta in Spanish; Carême deriving from ‘quarante’ in French. The English word ‘Lent’ has another, very beautiful derivation. It comes from the Anglo-Saxon (early English) word meaning to ‘lengthen’. Lent comes at a time when the hours or daytime are ‘lengthening’, as spring approaches, and so it is a time when we too can ‘lengthen’ spiritually, when we can stretch out and grow in the Spirit.This Easter season is the first year I, of thoroughly low church, evangelical provenance, did Lent.(Well, there was 2006, when I gave up sweet things, but if I’m being honest that was about 95 percent because I’d gained 10 pounds, 4 percent because the cafeteria food wasn’t tasty anyway, and maybe 1 percent because of Jesus.)With my husband and six of our friends/fellow house church members, I gave up alcohol. On Mardi Gras we went out for a couple delicious cocktails and what turned out to be truly expansive fancy pickle platter at new restaurant in town   —  Minnesota followers, let me pause this spiritual reflection to recommend you try Revival St. Paul if you have not already done so   — and that was it. Since then, my liquor collection has quietly dusted over.This coming Sunday is Easter, which means Lent is almost at an end. Perhaps this will sound like something of a letdown — though it really isn’t, and I’ll come back to why in a moment   — but I don’t think much has changed. I’m not sure I’ve really “lengthened” spiritually, and to be honest the time passed pretty quickly. Most days I didn’t feel much was missing. Perhaps giving up alcohol was not enough of a challenge (certainly compared to the 40-day desert fast which inspired this season, it is nothing at all). Next year, it seems, I should think a bit bigger.But there’s one way in which this season was noticeably different, which is that I noticed, again and again, that Easter is coming. Declining to drink was happily less trouble than I expected, but on almost a daily basis I reminded that I must decline, each time kicking off the same chain of thoughts: no liquor … because Lent … because Easter is coming!That has been a welcome and needed reminder. It is easy, I think, to forget the weight of Easter   —  and it is a weighty thing. Easter is not about ham and bunnies and flowers but the defeat of death itself:  Love’s redeeming work is done, Alleluia!Fought the fight, the battle won, Alleluia!Death in vain forbids him rise, Alleluia!Christ has opened paradise, Alleluia! Lives again our glorious King, Alleluia! Where, O death, is now thy sting? Alleluia! Once he died our souls to save, Alleluia! Where thy victory, O grave? Alleluia!  Easter’s deeply solemn cheer is especially easy to forget   when you live, as I do, a generally comfortable life in which these evils often feel a distant threat. (The memento mori is perhaps overdue for a comeback.) Easter can become, like Christmas often is, a day concerned with gifts and family and celebrating a new season. Or if, like me, you tend to be something of a holiday humbug, it can dwindle into just another Sunday. The one difference is an earlier service time: “Christ is risen.” “He is *yawn* risen indeed.”This novice attempt at Lent has forestalled most of that dwindling. I can’t claim, of course, to have reached some perfect state of anticipation, but at least I am anticipating. For this year, perhaps that may count as new length. " True link

An excerpt:Here’s a list I made back in January of 2016 of interventionist statements Trump had made up to that point:Trump has repeatedly endorsed the possibility of American ground troops in Iraq and Syria, expanding and prolonging that “stupid” war.He has criticized Obama for not sending in more American soldiers already.He wants to keep troops in Afghanistan long-term.He speaks enthusiastically of increased airstrikes, despite the fact that airstrikes were central to Clinton’s 2011 Libyan intervention—and the fact that under Obama the Pentagon has already launched so many airstrikes against ISIS that we’re literally running out of bombs.He has announced his plan to commit war crimes, intentionally bombing women and children.He claims to be the “most militaristic” GOP candidate—and while that’s a much-contested title this cycle, Trump is at least in the running.Even his supposed Iraq War prescience isn’t as good as he makes it out to be: His big opposition announcement came in July 2004, more than a year after the invasion, and Trump voted to reelect George W. Bush a few months later. It should thus be no surprise that Trump has selected remorseless, neocon Iraq War architect John Bolton as a foreign policy adviser.Rare Politics Editor Jack Hunter made a similar accounting several months later. As he concluded then, “Every shrewd [foreign policy] criticism Trump mouths is accompanied by an avalanche of horrible, undesirable and morally indefensible positions.” […]  Trump told us he is the “most militaristic,” that he is eager to escalate and expand our current wars even if he does not intend to launch new ones. (This Syria debacle manages to do both.) Why didn’t his supporters and friendly skeptics take that seriously?   " True link

An excerpt:   In recent decades, executive strength has been accompanied by legislative atrophy. Congress most certainly does not work for the president, but it often acts as if it does. We regularly hear of Congress being tasked with executing “the president’s agenda,” but constitutionally, it is the president who is supposed to administer the agenda set by Congress, not vice versa. […][O]ur legislative branch is slow. Don’t let the griping about a “do-nothing Congress” fool you: this is a feature, not a bug. Representing different constituencies means members of Congress are at loggerheads more often than not. This can seem aggravating—think about how often representatives you like are frustrated in their goals, but then think too about how often representatives you don’t like are frustrated in goals you don’t share.As President Calvin Coolidge said, “It is much more important to kill bad bills than to pass good ones.” And it is much easier to kill bad bills than it is to kill bad executive orders, which, as we’ve seen vividly of late, can be tossed off at great speed and on a single man’s whim.“The truth is that all men having power ought to be mistrusted,” said James Madison, the father of the Constitution.

An excerpt:This expanded bombing campaign, though, could be just the tip of the iceberg. In early March, The Guardian reported that the White House is considering a secret Pentagon proposal to designate temporary areas of active hostility in which the military could launch what amounts to six-month wars without congressional approval. Under the proposal, once the president signs off on a temporary battlefield, commanders would be given “the same latitude to launch strikes, raids and campaigns” as they now have in active U.S. warzones like Iraq. Protections for civilians would also be scaled back.These temporary battlefields, as The Guardian dubbed them, are not exactly new; the Obama administration already applied the label to conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. But the proposal Trump is considering would expand and formalize that decision, stretching the temporary battlefield designation to cover entire countries in which the United States is technically not at war. Despite the bureaucratic language, Trump’s plan, if implemented, is a flagrant perversion of the Constitution, redoubling the worst excesses of the Obama administration and further undercutting the rule of law."

My new column at The Week is about that:Trump’s allegations produced outrage and incredulity; Conway’s comments got pure mockery. Late-night comedians had a field day, with Stephen Colbert revealing one of his on-set cameras is, in fact, a kitchen appliance. We got tinfoil hat jokes, and spying Roomba jokes, and soon enough Conway was walking back her claim.But why? Internet of things surveillance — basically, your smart devices being able to spy on you — is a real and serious concern. Set aside, for a moment, the facts (or lack thereof) about this specific surveillance allegation. If you do, then absolutely nothing about Conway’s microwave statement is crazy.Remember that story about Samsung’s smart TVs back in 2015? The company outright warned its customers against having private conversations in front of this product. “Please be aware that if your spoken words include personal or other sensitive information, that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party,” Samsung said. The information wasn’t sold to other businesses or shipped straight over to NSA headquarters, of course, but the fact is that smart devices transmitting data poses a security risk — enough of a risk that Samsung gave this word of caution.Or what about that talking Barbie doll? Equipped with a mic, artificial intelligence à la the iPhone’s Siri assistant, and a Wi-Fi connection, Hello Barbie listened to what little kids said and answered back. Researchers soon found they could “get into the toy’s system to access users’ system information, Wi-Fi network names, internal MAC addresses, account IDs, and MP3 files.” This data could be harnessed to “find someone’s house and personal information, and could access their home network and listen to everything Barbie records.”And it isn’t just televisions and dolls. The former director of national intelligence, James Clapper, said in Senate testimony last year that the federal government is aware of the surveillance potential in the internet of things and has every intention of using those capabilities. “In the future, intelligence services might use the [internet of things] for identification, surveillance, monitoring, location tracking, and targeting for recruitment, or to gain access to networks or user credentials,” he said.Read the rest here."
