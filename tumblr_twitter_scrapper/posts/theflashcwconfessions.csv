Iris showed barely any grief about the situation until the funeral.    Like, I know the show didn’t care about HR, but this is just disgusting.

HR at least contributed to team Flash with his ideas, inspiring others and his quick thinking that saved the day more than once. He was fun and charismatic in addition to actually having something to offer to the team.  I also hated how quickly everyone got over HR dying… Just because Iris is saved and now she and Barry get to live happily ever after? (Or so they thought, anyway…) Don’t mind me, I’m just upset about one of my favorite characters in this show dying so that Iris could live. Iris, who has literally not much more to offer other than the frankly insipid romantic subplot. (Insipid and weird, because, be real, would you fall in love with your adoptive brother? I know I would not. I see why some people would look beyond this with the excuse that it is fiction–I tried, but it continues to be pretty weird when Joe continues to refer to Barry as his son). I’ve tried to continue liking Iris, and I think I still like her, but… I don’t get why they had to sacrifice a stronger character for her sake, when her story, in comparison, felt like it had run its course? She became a boring character to me already, it feels like the writers have no idea what to do with her other than just have her around for the sake of keeping at least Barry’s love interest from the comic books canon in the series as one of the few things that will not change.  She became boring to me as in she has no story other than being Barry’s love interest  ™   and step-sister, and this season also a damsel in distress, but now I’m indifferent to her character. I feel like she has no story anymore after season 1; once she and Barry became a thing, then she lost what made her interesting. She exists as an extension of Barry’s story and lacks a purpose of her own. If she was better written, and had more to offer other than Barry’s man pain and romantic subplot, then maybe I would haven’t felt upset that she got to live while HR died, but no. The writing for her is awful and she is only likable because the actress (Candice) does a good job with the material.  /Rant over.   Yeah, she really doesn’t belong." False text

But H.R. is a person. H.R. is someone that woke up every morning with a smile on his face, with kind words to share and happiness to spread. Do you know how rare it is in a person to just want to do good and to make people happy? Especially when most of the characters treated him so badly almost all of the time. They were constantly dismissing him and yet he still remained positive, he still remained loyal and kind. That isn’t an easy thing to do. H.R. was not, is not useless. He was a very vital part of the team because he was loyal, he was kind and supportive. When dealing with traumas like Team Flash did having someone that is always on your side no matter what - that is the type of person you need. H.R. always tried to help in what ever way he could and yes he made mistakes but so have most, if not all of the other characters - that’s what being human is, making mistakes and learning from them. H.R. inspired creativity in Tracy. He encouraged them all to be better. It was the little things he did to try and boost moral, to try and bring the team closer, to always show he cared. That shouldn’t be overlooked because he wasn’t as smart or physical as the others. Remember how he decorated the whole of Star Labs for Valentine’s Day and how he made each of them personalised cards. Or how he learnt everyone’s coffee orders. How he was the first to comfort Jesse when her dad was missing and how he helped train Wally when no one thought he could do it. H.R. messed up with words a lot of the time and yes he had a ‘foot in mouth’ thing often but when it mattered, when they truly needed him he knew what to say to help. Words and having someone that believes in you is not useless, having someone care enough to do these little things is not useless. Being creative doesn’t make him weak, not knowing how to fight doesn’t make him a coward. He gave his life to save Iris and he didn’t tell anyone about it because he knew they would try to stop him. He saved her because he wanted to prove his worth to the team and prove that he isn’t a coward. What he did was brave and fearless. H.R. was not a coward, H.R. saved someone else’s life and even as he was dying he still chose to use his last words to show someone else how much he appreciated them. If it wasn’t for H.R. then Iris would be dead. So whilst I know we’re all sad for Iris I want to take the time to appreciate H.R. and the sacrifice he made, the character he was and the hero he became. I love my caffeine puppy, I love his hats and his drumsticks. I love his care and compassion for others. I love his optimism and his humour. I love his caffeine addiction and how through everything he has become more than just “the other wells”. I will always love H.R for being a character type that I can relate to. H.R. deserves love and appreciation. Team Flash barely mourned him but I will. H.R Wells you will be missed, I hope you’re drinking coffee and playing the drums wherever you are. " False text

Iris is still alive, Savitar is dead and who knows about Caitlin being Killer frost >. Yeah, what they did with H.R. wasn’t quite as bad as I feared, but it was still a nasty copout. We need to be very vocal with the writers about how wrong their choices were.  What I did with my post early this month, make your case with what you want to happen this upcoming season.  Move away from the West-Allen nonsense – Iris is Barry’s foster sister, period. They call the same man “Dad” and have Wally as a brother. She should never have been lightswitched into a relationship with him, especially not on the bones of Eddie Thawne. Stop trying to make them work – they never have on this show, and they never will.After Barry leaves the Speed Force prison, have him seek to redeem himself by being a better man and a better hero. No more obviously selfish moves like Flashpoint. He needs to prove he’s matured.Have Caitlin regain her hope and also seek to redeem herself by being a hero. Do not force her to be with Julian (he’s wrong for her) or any other man, not even Barry. As much as I want Snowbarry, it needs proper development first. Speaking of which…Repair Original Team Flash and stop forcing Iris and other third parties into it. Barry, Caitlin, and Cisco need to heal their wounds, and while part of that they must do on their own, another part of that is leaning on each other. The other characters should support their stories, not rule them.No more speedster Big Bads for a while. As much as I wanted there to be an actual Savitar whose name Future Flash had stolen, I’d rather have that be the plot of a much later season, something that will require an army of speedsters to stop and be suitably epic. Frankly, I think Gorilla Grodd deserves his chance to shine as the chief threat, and not for just a single episode or a two-parter." False text

They will have to make one hell of a story if they want to bring her back in the future after giving her the cure. My theory is that Caitlin Frost is back in control since 3x21. You can tell, KF fully in control wouldn’t try to talk down Savitar or challenging him by using Iris memories. KF wouldn’t use the name “Caitlin” since she wants to get ride of her at all cost.   In the finale, she will realize how her powers can help the team and that no matter if she has powers or not they will accept her in the team.  She will reject the cure and possibly Julian. Telling him that she needs time for herself and to learn how to control her powers going in season 4. That leave them the possibility to bring him back from time to time in the future.

Did having an early start in the Hollywood world help or hinder this transition? Why or why not? I’m grateful I got to start so young.

At first, she doesn’t really know what to make of her powers. She’s experimenting a little bit, as we saw in episode 4, and it’s getting to the point where she knows she needs help and she’s not ready to go to Team Flash yet, because I don’t think she knows what she’s going to say. So she goes to her mom as another expert in the medical field, and tries to get some assistance from her mom, but she’s not quite as successful as she’d hoped.   What can you tease of Caitlin’s dynamic with her mother?I was so excited to see the relationship between Caitlin and her mom. Their interaction, though sort of brief over this one episode, starts to fill in a lot of the blanks as to why we haven’t seen Caitlin’s family, or her mom, for the last couple of years.

And how challenging has that been to play? Danielle Panabaker: No, I didn’t expect her to have so many ups and downs when I joined The Flash, but it’s been a lot of fun. I feel so lucky that they’ve given me such great material and that I’ve been able to get to play so much. How aware were you of the comic book Caitlin/Killer Frost when you signed on? Not at all! Everything I know about comic books, which is so not a lot, is what I’ve learned in the last two and a half years. It’s been great to learn more about The Flash and his universe and all the different characters. No pun intended, but was it ever daunting going in to this role cold? It was a little daunting. I can’t keep up with all of the villains at all! We comic book fans are notorious for being a little bit too precious at times. Was that something that ever worried you when you got the role? You know, I’m always ready to open myself up to criticism. I think you just have to let it roll off your back and, like Taylor Swift, just Shake It Off. Keep reading" False link

We also really want to honor where those characters are. We left them ambiguous at the end of Season 4, they’ll stay ambiguous for a while. Olicity fans will get some answers in episode five. From there, we are going to write to see where [Stephen and Emily] take them. If that leads to reconciliation, then we’ll write to that. If not, we’ll have to see what happens. A lot more clarity is coming in episode five. I wonder if they realize the reason the relationship failed is because they threw a drama grenade unnecessarily at them. Now it’s like “Let’s see if it still works after we completely screwed up something that didn’t need to be screwed up at all.”  Well, there are probably several methods by which they could make up for that big mistake. The question is indeed: Do they even realize their mistake?

That is a hopeful sign. :) " False link
