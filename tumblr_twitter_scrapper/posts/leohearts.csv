Hope you get this. Don’t ever think that, you did nothing wrong. This was not your fault.  He is an idiot to let you go. He wanted space and wasn’t ready for a relationship so you gave him space which was good. But then he goes behind your back and starts dating another girl that is just wrong. I don’t know you personally but I bet your amazing and beautiful you don’t need to waste your time thinking about him. I know this is painful and you must really like him. But trust me you don’t need a guy like that in your life.  You will find someone better who will treat you right. Just be yourself always and never give up. Let me know if this helps. Lx" True text

If we learn to forgive more often we realise ourself from the pain and the burden. I’m not saying that forgiving someone makes everything ok or what they did was ok but I’m saying that we shouldn’t harm ourselves by holding on to it and causing ourself pain. That person doesn’t need to be a part of your life anymore which is why forgiving and letting go makes you feel a little less pained and maybe also means you can make peace with the pain that was caused. " True text

It’s what we all want and what we all are looking for. It’s only a matter of time when one day that certain someone walks in our lives and says “hi I’m here and I’ve been looking for you, and you’ve been waiting for me” that day when it happens we finally learn why it never worked out with anyone else because they weren’t this beautiful person who’s standing in-front of us. We will in this life meet many beautiful and kind people, make lots of good friends, have many lovers and loves but possibly only one true soul mate, one true love who will look pass all our faults and imperfections, will look at us and instantly know how we are feeling and will always forgive our misdeeds and say “I still love you and will do so until my last breath”. The only thing left to do is to now find that person and start building our life with them but until that happens of course we can still walk through life writing our story and meeting new people and seeing where we end up."
