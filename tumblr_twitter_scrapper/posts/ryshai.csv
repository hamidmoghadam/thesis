TAKE A GOOD LONG LOOK.¬† MEMORIZE THE PACKAGING SO YOU MAKE SURE YOU NEVER BUY THIS CREAM FOR YOURSELF OR ANYONE YOU LOVE. This post is about vaginas. My vagina in particular. I get yeast infections pretty regularly, and until recently I was able to afford to see a doctor who could prescribe me¬†fluconazole. Fluconazole, a drug also¬†known by the brand name¬†Diflucan, is a small pink pill. You take two pills a few days apart from each other to restore balance and harmony to your bountiful folds. I‚Äôve never ever had a bad side effect from taking this pill. Cut to November 2016. I‚Äôm a recent college grad without reliable health care coverage in the process of finding a job. And I‚Äôm dealing with a yeast infection. Before I moved out of state, my previous doctor told me about Miconazole. She said it was as effective as the pill and hallelujah, it‚Äôs over the counter! I decided to purchase the cream pictured above. This treatment only lasted 3 days, a convenient time frame for my schedule. The application process was a little messy, and some of the cream came in contact with my vulva and labia. Within 5 minutes every piece of skin that had come in contact with the cream, excluding my hands,¬†was on fire. I wanted to scream it was so painful. I began frantically searching for what I should do online.¬† I found a whole forum of people on drugs.com who had experienced something similar.¬†These comments saved me, and these were just on the first page. There were 33 pages total, the earliest dated July 2009. I was writhing in pain at 2AM when I found this forum (which I found by searching ‚Äúmy vagina burn itch hurts after miconazole‚Äù on Google). As soon as I read these comments I threw the devil cream directly into the trash and jumped in the shower. I didn‚Äôt feel any actual relief until I reached in and scraped the cream out of me. I paid $17 plus tax on this bullshit, but I could have just as easily ripped up my money or paid someone to not hurt me.¬† The moral of the story is that vaginal health care is is completely fucked up because we don‚Äôt have access to an over the counter cure for yeast infections that is safe for our bodies and also YOU SHOULD NEVER BUY THIS CREAM EVER. Reblog to save a vagina.  Okay so I used to get yeast infections every month after my period¬†‚Äòcause my pH levels were fucked up or something (idk that‚Äôs what my doctor said) and I actually used to take this stuff and it was fine. Then a couple years down the road I had a yeast infection for the first time in ages and I used this again and it burned so bad I had to sit in the bath and like physically dig it out of my vagina AND THEN I LEARNED THAT IT‚ÄôS BECAUSE I DIDN‚ÄôT HAVE A YEAST INFECTION. I had a bacterial infection, which is honestly pretty much identical to a yeast infection depending on the severity. The only difference is that IF YOU HAVE A BACTERIAL INFECTION AND TRY TO USE YEAST INFECTION MEDICATION IT WILL HURT But it‚Äôs not actually the medication‚Äôs fault. The medication DOES do what it‚Äôs supposed to do, provided you‚Äôre actually suffering from a yeast infection. Chances are though that you and every one who commented on this did, in fact, have bacterial infections instead. FORTUNATELY they also make over the counter tests so you can know if you need to call your doctor or just grab some yeast medicine off the shelf. Next time if you aren‚Äôt sure, pee on a stick and save yourself a world of fucking pain  AMEN.  It‚Äôs unfortunate that I‚Äôm 27 and never knew that last bit of information. The world of vaginal health is so obscure and inaccessible.  Reblogging because I too once found out the hard way that I had a bacterial & not yeast infection. üòë  I, too, once set my vagina aflame with miconazole. I didn‚Äôt know it was because of a bacterial infection. Reblogging to save a vag. " False text

Do me a favour. Go to pornhub and look at the lesbian category. Tell me how many dicks you see. 0? Exactly.  Wow, what an excellent point! If pornhub doesn‚Äôt recognize trans lesbians, they must not exist!  Urgh, I have to explain this to you? Really? Transwomen aren‚Äôt real women. Call me transphobic but that‚Äôs how biology works. Transwomen may feel and identify as a women but they are biologically a man and their gender is still male. Therefore, if you were born with a penis and like vaginas, you are either bi or heterosexual.   Do tell me, what exactly makes a woman a woman? Is it genitals? But they have surgery and get vaginas. Is it sex chromosomes? But you actually can have XY and be born with female genitals, because the gene in Y that is supposed to make you make doesn‚Äôt work. What makes us all certain gender is the structure of our brains, and trans women‚Äôs brains are not male brains.  A woman is a woman when she isn‚Äôt born with a Y chromosome. *wink*  I‚Äôd love to see how you persuade some of them, those who were born with vaginas. Btw, do you know your genotype?  Btw, do you always try to ask irrelevant questions to ignore that you‚Äôre wrong?  I‚Äôm not wrong. Prove it first before making claims.  About 99% of scientists who care about science and not Social Justic see the Y chromosome as making someone male. Argue with them  And where are your links, studies to back that up? They don‚Äôt exist. Even the APA will back up the validity of trans identities. So shut the fuck up.  That was short, sweet, and to the point.   Far from all living things subscribe to the XY gender spectrum, so before you make claims about what us scientists care about, consider doing some legitimate research.  Terf, science is against you.  Biologically, there are 27 sexes. Hormones, genitalia, and chromosomes are typically used to determine sex. Each has three possibilities: generally female, generally male, and indeterminate. They don‚Äôt always line up, and can combine in any way. 3^3=27 Don‚Äôt believe me? Here we go! The possible pairings of hormones, genitalia, and chromosomes are: FFF*FFMFFIFIFFIMFIIFMFFMMFMIMFFMFMMFIMIFMIMMIIMMFMMM*MMIIFFIFMIFIIIFIIMIIIIMFIMMIMI *Notice how these two are not the only possibilities?

And the authorities in each place would look at this tiny, shuffling, bearded rav and let him in. So the rosh yeshiva would go to the classroom or the cafeteria or whatever, wherever the children were, and he would put his hand over his eyes and say the six words of the Shema. ‚ÄúSHEMA,‚Äù He would start, slowly enough, ‚ÄúADO-NAI ELO-HEINU,‚Äù and he would hear little voices joining in, ‚ÄúADO-NAI ECHAD!‚Äù  And sure enough, when he quickly uncovered his eyes he would see little kids blinking up at him, wondering where he came from. The Shema is the first prayer a Jewish child learns, and it is the last prayer one says before death. Time among Christians would not have taken it from all the Jewish children.

I‚Äôm tired of people including me and other people who don‚Äôt want to be included in that word, and before anyone asks, I never meant that OP did that, because I literally have no idea if they do.  Queer is a slur as much as any other LGBT+ word, I just want you to be aware of that.  ‚ÄúGay‚Äù is used as an insult. It is used to be demeaning. Its used to discriminate. And yet its used as the all mighty umbrella - gay rights, gay marriage, gay community - when discussing the entire community.  Gay gets used as a slur. Queer gets used as a slur. But I don‚Äôt walk up to gay people and say ‚Äúyour identity is a slur, you know that right‚Äù or get pissed when they say ‚Äúthe gay community‚Äù when they mean the whole community.  Personal identity and preference in terms, even harmful words that get used as slurs, are not questioned; except for the word Queer.  Queer gets shut down. Queer people get others in their faces saying ‚Äúyour identity is a slur!‚Äù Queer people don‚Äôt have the freedom to identify in a community, but are forced under other terms against their will due to hypocrisy and double standards.  So if you‚Äôre not going to come onto gay people‚Äôs posts for the same behavior, maybe critically analyze why exactly you feel the need to be so condescending to Queer people, specifically on posts that ONLY have to do with personal identity. Why you feel the need to insist to Queer people that their identities are slurs, to directly slap away the power of reclaiming a word from them by demanding it remain in the hands of the Straights as a perpetual slur.  I think an important difference between gay and queer is however, that queer started out as a slur used against members of the community and continues to be used as a slur in many places. Whereas gay began as a word the community chose itself to describe itself and was then later used by homophobes and heterosexuals in general in a negative way, meaning however, that gay doesn‚Äôt hold the same negative connotations as queer for many people simply because it was our word that they took, and not a word that they forced on us to make us ‚Äústrange‚Äù or ‚Äúother‚Äù like queer means.  That‚Äôs‚Ä¶. Not true. People think so because the history before gay was reclaimed is way older (older than any love community member‚Äôs lifetimes, probably,) but gay had the exact same origins.  It was meant to denote sexually perverse people, most frequently sex workers and those who hired them. Anyone who participated in anything but married, vanilla, straight sex might have been referred to as ‚Äúgay,‚Äù including any suspected LGBT person.  The word (already being one frequently used on the community,) was reclaimed as a community identifier when the community wanted to disconnect from the clinical and diagnostic implications of ‚Äúhomosexual.‚Äù  There is record of queer being reclaimed and used as a personal identifier literally before the popularization of gay. Both words are reclaimed slurs with negative histories, and BOTH are used as slurs against the community still to this day.  The more recent history of the mid to late 20th century more prevalently favored queer as a slur, as is represented in our media. However its clearly undeniable that the switch back to gay as the popular community slur (along with the ever present f slur,) happened in the 2000s. Which is trying to be denied and rewritten by the anti queer crowd, who completely ignore the words popularity with community members who actually lived through when it was a popular slur.  Yes to all of this. When it comes to words for¬†‚Äúnot straight‚Äù there are hardly any choices that didn‚Äôt originate as ways to stigmatize or pathologize us. We are all using reclaimed slurs to describe ourselves.¬† Also, queer is reclaimed in a particularly empowering way. It doesn‚Äôt just mean¬†‚Äúsame-sex attraction‚Äù but encompasses a whole spectrum of attractions and gender orientations. It‚Äôs a word that says to asexuals, pansexuals, bisexuals, trans folks, genderfluid and genderqueer and genderless folks and people who are still figuring themselves out, ‚Äúhey, you‚Äôve got a home here. We don‚Äôt need to categorize you to love you.‚Äù¬† This is important because there are a lot of divisions within the LGBTQ+ world, and in particular cis gay men and cis lesbians often overlook or exclude trans, bi and asexual people. Queer is the only word that not only demands equal acceptance for everyone, but leaves the door open for words and descriptors that haven‚Äôt even been invented yet.¬† Somebody else pointed this out earlier to me, and of course I‚Äôve lost the post, but it‚Äôs really suspicious that of all the reclaimed slurs, the one that gets the most pushback is the one that is most radically accepting of all identities    ‚Äúhey, you‚Äôve got a home here. We don‚Äôt need to categorize you to love you.‚Äù Lmao yeah! the pushback against this idea is overt and disgusting and I don‚Äôt trust anybody who perpetuates it.¬† Queer is an ideology and an identity, historically and now. It is an umbrella for that ideology and an umbrella for those identities, historically and now. They can‚Äôt be conflated (with LGBT) and it‚Äôs super fucking disingenuous to pretend one is just the tarnished besmirched dirty slur version of the other. They‚Äôre different. In my particular work for example, Queer bioethics is different from LGBT bioethics and conflating the two will muddle any discussion you try to have about them because they lead to literally opposite¬†conclusions in some cases.¬†  Yeah I freaking love pancakes  Wait wrong post  By far the best addition to this post  This is one of those things where I feel like an old.  Like, *the* slogan I associate with pride is, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here, we‚Äôre queer ‚Äì get used to it!‚Äù   There was a TV show   called ‚ÄúQueer Eye for the Straight Guy‚Äù that was total mainstream pap.   (Not that the show wasn‚Äôt riddles problematic elements from the concept out, but ‚Äòqueer‚Äô in the title was clearly meant as a positive.)I just have a hard time processing queer as anything but reclaimed.     They actually shot ‚ÄúQueer As Folk‚Äù in my city!  TERFs and radical gender/sexuality bianarists are flooding social media and blogging sites with propaganda smearing the word queer in the hopes of silencing all of us who don‚Äôt identify with their hate politics. I fought hard to reclaim the word queer in the late 80s and early 90s, and it‚Äôs the one word that doesn‚Äôt worship exclusion. Which is why these people are trying to convince you not to use it. fuck that noise. there is literally no word i could use to identify my sexuality that hasn‚Äôt been thrown at me in hatred, fear, and violence. No way am I giving up the one of those that allows me to talk about all of my community without trying to put people in boxes they don‚Äôt fit in.  I will never not reblog this post. Queer, queer, queer here.¬†  ‚ÄúQueer‚Äù has been claimed by queer people as a self-descriptor since at least 1910. It‚Äôs an insult to those historical people (and all the generations of queer historical people who have identified as queer since then) to pretend that the people using it as a slur owned it more than the queer people who used it as a self-descriptor. Source: George Chauncey, ‚ÄúGay New York,‚Äù page 101  They don‚Äôt want us to use queer because they don‚Äôt want to be lumped in with anyone who‚Äôs not cis gay or cis lesbian. So fine. You don‚Äôt like the word queer? You don‚Äôt want to be in the ‚Äúqueer‚Äù community? Get the fuck out, then. Y'all don‚Äôt welcome us in your community anyway, so we‚Äôll just have our own. And it‚Äôll be queer as fuck.  I fucking love the word queer ‚ù§  Or, to put it another way, using a great old slogan of the community: I‚Äôm not gay as in happy, I‚Äôm queer as in fuck you.  Yes yes yes yes yes! These younglings today don‚Äôt know their queer history but feel so free to comment on it. Trying so desperately to assimilate into straight culture by turning your nose up at queer, and all the people who take refuge under its umbrella.¬†Queer accepted me when nobody else would, not even the LGBT groups.¬† Queer is full of the types of people who don‚Äôt make good poster children for the middle class assimilationist cis gay couple just looking to get married and have some kids. Queer forces us to realize the fight didn‚Äôt end with gay marriage, and cis gays are gonna have to step out of the spotlight sometimes, and realize cis gays have privilege, and fight for someone with less.¬†Trans people, nonbinary people, people in nontraditional relationship structures, aromantics, asexuals, sex workers. Heck more and more bisexual people these days are switching over to queer because the amount of biphobia in the so-called lgBt community is so alienating, and also because so many of us feel the term bisexual reinforces a false gender dichotomy and we‚Äôre too tired of jokes about kitchenware to use pansexual. Part of what I love about the term queer is that it does make people uncomfortable. It makes them aware of their privilege, exposes certain biases, even within the LGBT community. What‚Äôs so wrong with a movement that strives to fight for everybody, huh? Huh?  Proudly bi, proudly queer, and being part of this movement when I was young was an honor.  From the Queer Nation manifesto Text of a manifesto originally passed out by people marching with the ACT UP contingent in the New York Gay Pride Day parade, 1990. -  An Army of Lovers Cannot LoseBeing queer is not about a right to privacy; it is about the freedom to be public, to just be who we are. It means everyday fighting oppression; homophobia, racism, misogyny, the bigotry of religious hypocrites and our own self-hatred. (We have been carefully taught to hate ourselves.) And now of course it means fighting a virus as well, and all those homo-haters who are using AIDS to wipe us off the face of the earth.Being queer means leading a different sort of life. It‚Äôs not about the mainstream, profit-margins, patriotism, patriarchy or being assimilated. It‚Äôs not about executive directors, privilege and elitism. It‚Äôs about being on the margins, defining ourselves; it‚Äôs about gender-f‚Äî and secrets, what‚Äôs beneath the belt and deep inside the heart; it‚Äôs about the night. Being queer is ‚Äúgrass roots‚Äù because we know that everyone of us, every body, every c‚Äî, every heart and a‚Äì and d‚Äî is a world of pleasure waiting to be explored. Everyone of us is a world of infinite possibility.We are an army because we have to be. We are an army because we are so powerful. (We have so much to fight for; we are the most precious of endangered species.) And we are an army of lovers because it is we who know what love is. Desire and lust, too. We invented them. We come out of the closet, face the rejection of society, face firing squads, just to love each other! Every time we f‚Äî, we win.We must fight for ourselves (no else is going to do it) and if in that process we bring greater freedom to the world at large then great. (We‚Äôve given so much to that world: democracy, all the arts, the concepts of love, philosophy and the soul, to name just a few of the gifts from our ancient Greek Dykes, Fags.) Let‚Äôs make every space a Lesbian and Gay space. Every street a part of our sexual geography. A city of yearning and then total satisfaction. A city and a country where we can be safe and free and more. We must look at our lives and see what‚Äôs best in them, see what is queer and what is straight and let that straight chaff fall away! Remember there is so, so little time. And I want to be a lover of each and every one of you. Next year, we march naked.   guys. if you go to college and want to study our history and current political climate etc? do you know what that ¬†department is called? ‚ÄúQueer Studies‚Äù. So could you fucking stop, you little babies. " False text

One day I was talking to a friend about one of them and we started reading it and she was asking a ton if questions and seemed really excited and interested by it and I answered questions and explained stuff. We talked about the books during recess and eventually more girls joined in until we were a group of about 10-15 seven year-olds talking about puberty and sex and a lot of things that most adults don‚Äôt The thing about those books is that they look really innocent with cute drawings and there are chapters about brushing your teeth and stuff; but what most people don‚Äôt expect is that there‚Äôs a lot of health stuff about puberty and mental illness and drugs and a lot of really important stuff that everyone should know. The teachers didn‚Äôt care because the books looked super innocent and they thought were talking about proper brushing habits or something. We‚Äôd go sit down and read a chapter and I‚Äôd add some other stuff that my mom had told me and then we‚Äôd just talk and ask questions. It was kind of like group therapy but with sex ed. This was all okay until one of the boys saw a page with a ton of boobs on it (the page was demonstrating a breast exam) and he told the teacher. So they found and I got suspended and I wasn‚Äôt allowed to bring any more of those books into school.¬† Closer to the end of the year, one of the second grade teachers was revealed to be a pedophile when one of his students said that he tried to touch her inappropriately and then three other girls came forward with the same story. After he was arrested, the girl told me that she said what he did because we had talked about what to do in that exact situation. Because of our group she knew that she probably wasn‚Äôt the only one and she knew that it was wrong for him to do that and that she wouldn‚Äôt get in trouble if she told someone and that she probably wouldn‚Äôt have said anything if she hadn‚Äôt read those books. I started doing it again the next year. No one stopped me.¬† " False text

This has to do with claims that she is a Zionist and that she‚Äôs an awful human being because she served in the IDF (the Israeli Army) and yada yada. FIRST OF ALL: Serving in the Israeli military is required of all citizens. She served for 2 years as a combat TRAINER. She was badass enough to be a combat trainer in one of the most deadly armed forces in the world (these are the people who created Krav Maga, okay?) and she did not engage in active combat. She killed no one. Her service was mandatory and after she got out, she went to law school because she is very passionate about justice and social issues.¬†The most noteworthy thing about her views on her time in the military is that she says quite frequently that she wishes no country had the need for a military. She is very much a proponent of peace. As for the Zionism claims‚Ä¶ there you get into the debate of what Zionism actually means. Does it automatically mean you are anti-Palestinian, or does it simply mean you believe in the Jewish state of Israel? I‚Äôll let you decide but‚Ä¶ Here is what I do know about Gal: She is an Israeli. She was born and raised there. She believes her people have a right to their homeland because they, like her, were born and raised there. I have seen NOTHING of her saying anything hateful about Palestinians. You can argue about history all you like but the important thing is actually THE PEOPLE.   The moment we side with a government over people is the moment we lose.  Most people alive today in that area were born and raised there and so it IS THEIR HOME, regardless of them being Israeli or Palestinian. It is home to them both. (Again, not arguing the HISTORY of the people. But the actual people who are alive there today.) The goal should not be to take sides with either government, but to hope that the people themselves can coexist peacefully and happily. That is what Gal believes in. She wants the conflict to stop and for peace to be achieved. Just because she is a proud Israeli and a proud Jew does not mean she is automatically anti-Palestinian or anything else. Personally I think it is amazing and beautiful that an Israeli Jewish woman is portraying Wonder Woman, one of the most iconic superheroes of all time.¬† Other things about Gal? She is most proud of being a mother to a 4-year-old little girl named Alma. Her daughter loves princesses but Gal says Alma has told her that princesses seem weak and that they always need a prince to save them. Gal said that broke her heart because she wants her daughter to grow up knowing that women are amazing and can do anything, and so can she. So being Wonder Woman has come at the perfect time for her because her daughter is watching her every move and she says Wonder Woman embodies everything that is wonderful about women. Not only is she strong and brave and fierce‚Ä¶ she is compassionate and kind and intelligent. Gal says she hopes women AND MEN will see Diana/Wonder Woman and understand and appreciate all the complexities of being a woman and how powerful we are just by being ourselves. She‚Äôs also a real goofball and loves to joke around and dance on set. AND she gained‚Ä¶ wait for it‚Ä¶ 17 lbs of muscle for the role! That is INSANE! Not to mention that I‚Äôve never heard anyone more coherently understand the true nature of Diana the way Gal does. She understands that the best thing about Wonder Woman is how truly GOOD she is‚Ä¶ how much she cares and believes in mankind, and yet that compassion does not undermine her strength and power. Instead it enhances it. She really GETS the character and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so excited to see her portrayal. So yeah‚Ä¶ can we please stop blindly hating on her because someone somewhere made some claim and we think it makes us smart and politically superior to believe it and support it? It doesn‚Äôt. It just makes you look like a weak-minded jerk. Do your own research. This goes for other things as well. Don‚Äôt jump on hate trains just because you want to seem cool or smart. GAL GADOT IS AMAZING AND IS GOING TO BE AN AWESOME WONDER WOMAN! I leave you with this gif of her being adorable on set of BvS.  Other things you might not know about Gal: - Her grandparents were Holocaust survivors. - She studied biology in high school and went to law school after she got out of the military. She wanted to be a lawyer but decided to pursue modeling and acting after a scout saw her on campus. - She said she was good at basketball in school because of her height. - While she won Miss Israel, she purposely tanked Miss Universe because she was so over the pageant thing. She went to the morning breakfasts in her pajamas even though you were supposed to wear a gown. All the other contestants loved her. - She was ranked the second highest paid model in Israel in 2013 behind Bar Refaeli. - She does all of her own stunts. (I mean, she was a military combat trainer.) - She‚Äôs a motorcycle rider and owns a Ducati Monster-S2R. " False text

My school banned the fidget spinners almost immediately after they became a thing. However, they let teachers decide how to deal with them in their classrooms. What I found was that students saw them as toys, not tools, and didn‚Äôt know how to use them appropriately. They knew what they were for - to help them focus - but they didn‚Äôt use them that way. My class has a LOT of students (probably a majority) who could benefit from being able to fidget. Some have identified ADHD or Autism, others don‚Äôt and probably never will. So rather than banning the spinners, I said okay. But here‚Äôs the catch. I didn‚Äôt just let the kids play with them and say ‚Äúoh, they just need to fidget.‚Äù I took the time one morning to TEACH the kids how to use fidget tools to actually help them focus. It only took one lesson, and my kids are generally not rule-followers. As someone who uses fidget tools, I was able to demonstrate for them what it looks like when someone is using them to focus. Basically, it means you‚Äôre keeping the fidget low and out of sight (in your lap if you‚Äôre sitting or down by your side if you‚Äôre standing) and your focus is on the task (or speaker) at hand, not the fidget itself.  Now my students know what the expectation is, and they‚Äôve been great with their fidgets ever since. If they start playing with the fidget tools, all I have to do is say ‚Äúit‚Äôs a tool, not a toy,‚Äù and they immediately adjust and use it correctly.  Instead of banning fidgets, schools and teachers need to take about 5-10 minutes and teach kids HOW to fidget.  And no, not every kid who needs a fidget is going to be able to get a doctor‚Äôs note. That‚Äôs just ridiculous.  This is also a good life skill that children could benefit from learning.  I don‚Äôt know how to make the clap emoji on my computer but know that is what I‚Äôm trying to convey  Here we are. The best thing to do about fidget tools. " False text

But my ancestors were buried there for generations,‚Äù Bulka told Haaretz last week. ‚ÄúI have at least 150 relatives buried there and I wanted to visit their graves to say Kaddish [the mourner‚Äôs prayer].‚ÄùBut at the local cemetery, where Jews had been buried since the 18th century, he was greeted by vandalized graves and piles of rocks that had once been gravestones. Despite his efforts, he was unable to locate even a single relative‚Äôs grave.A local man who was walking his dog pointed him to a site in the distance where, the man said, he would find ‚ÄúJewish graves.‚Äù When Bulka got to the site, his heart nearly stopped. The ‚Äúgraves‚Äù were pieces of Jewish gravestones that had been used as stones to build the wall around the town‚Äôs Christian cemetery. Bulka, a religious man, was furious. ‚ÄúIt was a disgrace,‚Äù he says.Upon returning from his trip, Bulka, 50, a resident of Sha‚Äôarei Tikva, began researching the fate of the Jewish graves markers, discovering that they had been uprooted around 1959, when the Communists ruled. Photos he located with the help of a local blogger document the desecration of the cemetery. Along with photos of the gravestones being uprooted, one can also see that some were incorporated into a playground for local residents.In early 2016, a few months after his first visit to the city, Bulka went back to Ostrowiec to meet the mayor. His first, unequivocal demand was that the gravestones be removed from the wall of the Christian cemetery. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt rest until these markers are safely returned,‚Äù he told the mayor.He came to the meeting with a few concrete suggestions. One was to take the misappropriated gravestones and turn them into a memorial, with the help of Israeli teens who would visit the area during their trips to Poland. Another proposal was to send the stones to Israel.‚ÄúThere are a lot of suitable options, just so they don‚Äôt remain a wall in a Christian cemetery,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI tried to explain to the mayor that we see these monuments as holy objects, and as such Jewish law bans them from being used for any other purpose.‚ÄùAfter consultations, the mayor agreed to remove the Jewish gravestones from the cemetery wall, on condition that Bulka fund the dismantling of the stones, their transport to another location and the rebuilding of the wall. He demanded half a million zloty, around 460,000 shekels (over $125,000).Bulka was astonished. ‚ÄúNot only do you take my people‚Äôs gravestones and use them for disrespectful purpose, you expect me to build you a new wall?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no reason for us to fund the construction of a wall for a Christian cemetery.‚ÄùHis frustration grew as all his appeals to organizations, agencies and private individuals who deal with the preservation of Jewish cemeteries refused to help or even answer his inquiries. ‚ÄúApparently this town isn‚Äôt central enough or interesting enough to anyone whose family isn‚Äôt buried here,‚Äù he says, despairingly.A turning point came when he discovered that there are three properties in the town that are registered in its land registry as belonging to his family. ‚ÄúI have proof that for seven generations my family owned land there,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúSince my whole family was murdered in the Holocaust, my family is the only heir to them.‚ÄùBulka hopes that now he has a bargaining chip with which to approach the city. ‚ÄúI will propose to the municipality that I will give up these properties if they give up the gravestones, a kind of barter,‚Äù he says.Deep down, however, he knows that Eastern European bureaucracy won‚Äôt exactly work in his favor and that while his plan looks logical on paper, it probably won‚Äôt lead to the ‚Äúliberation of the gravestones,‚Äù as he puts it, in the near term, especially since until now he‚Äôs been working on his own.He is now looking for a person or organization with some resources to pursue his fight. ‚ÄúEvery day that passes, the blasphemy there continues,‚Äù he says.The city of Ostrowiec Swietokrzyski did not respond to Haaretz‚Äôs request for a comment. On Yom HaShoah, it is important to remember that the antisemitism and dehumanization that allowed the Shoah to happen in the first place hasn‚Äôt disappeared, has not been cured, has not been addressed, and has not abated.  Is there a way people can donate money to help?Because this is so disrespectful that I‚Äôm speechless." False link

The video, which was shot during an all-women‚Äôs event in Sydney‚Äôs west and posted to Facebook by the women‚Äôs branch of Hizb Ut-Tahrir, was revealed by The Australian newspaper this morning. It features two Muslim women explaining that according to their understanding of Islam, men can discipline their wives by ‚Äúhitting‚Äù them with a small stick or twisted scarf so as not to cause pain. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very evident that this is symbolic in nature,‚Äù one of the women said. Fordham said the video echoed recent comments by Australian Federation of Islamic Councils President Keysar Trad, who sparked controversy when he suggested an angry husband could beat his wife as a ‚Äúlast resort‚Äù. Mr Trad later backtracked on the comment and described it as a ‚Äúslip up‚Äù. But Fordham said the new Facebook video was more proof that moderate Muslims need new leadership in Australia. ‚ÄúMake no mistake, these views belong to some but not all followers of the Islamic faith,‚Äù Fordham said. ‚ÄúBut when you have people in positions of power spreading dangerous messages, it is important to call them out. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never okay to hit your wife. Never. That‚Äôs called assault. If you hit a woman, you‚Äôre a coward. It‚Äôs not okay to hit your wife gently, or softly, or occasionally or any other way you want to spin it. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs assault. It‚Äôs illegal. It‚Äôs wrong.‚Äù The passionate host said domestic violence shouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúdownplayed‚Äù. ‚ÄúJust stop. We have young Muslim women growing up in this country and they need to know they have the same rights as anyone else. They live in Australia. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt need these so-called leaders telling them they‚Äôre punching bags.‚Äù Silma Ihram from the Australian Muslim Women‚Äôs Association has criticised the video‚Äôs message, arguing Islam in no way condones violence. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, patriarchal cultures and organisations continue to try and relegate Muslim women to domestic duties and control by their husbands,‚Äù she told 9news.com.au. ‚ÄúThis was not the practice of the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings upon him) nor the intent of the jurists in their interpretations of Islamic law, and definitely should not be condoned in any form today.‚Äú Controversial former army major Bernard Gaynor said the incident raises questions about Mohamadu Nawaz Saleem, an imam who was appointed to the Defence Force‚Äôs religious advisory committee in 2015. ‚ÄúSaleem was appointed in June 2015, just four months after he signed a statement condemning the former Abbott government‚Äôs ‚Äòdemonisation‚Äô of Hizb ut-Tahrir,‚Äù he said. He called on Minister for Defence Marise Payne to remove Mr Saleem ¬†‚Äúand make it clear that those who support Hizb ut Tahrir are not welcome in the ADF‚Äù. The federal government considered banning Hizb ut-tahrir several years ago, before ruling it was not a terrorist organisation. The organisation, which loosely translates to ‚ÄòThe Party of Liberation‚Äô, is a global organisation that ‚Äúworks to resume the Islamic way of life through the establishment of the Khilafah (Caliphate) in the Muslim world‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe current situation in the Muslim world is a lamentable one, with deeply embedded corruption, open oppression, injustice‚Ä¶ these are problems which Hizb ut-Tahrir works to change,‚Äù the organisation states on its website. Hizb ut-Tahrir has been contacted for comment.  lol , why is ¬†Silma Ihram lying ,where does she think patriarchal cultures gain their teaching? it‚Äôs literally in the quran as a form of disciplining the wife ,chapter 4 verse 34 ‚ÄúMen are in charge of women by [right of] what Allah has given one over the other and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth. So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband‚Äôs] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance - [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand.‚Äù also the prophet mentioned the same passage above in his last sermon which he approves of striking the wife if she doesn‚Äôt obey her husband ! does she not know her own religion ?! islam in no way condones violence ! , lol¬† " False link
