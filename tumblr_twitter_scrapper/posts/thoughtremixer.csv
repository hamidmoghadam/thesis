I was invited by Tumblr and it was in collab with PBS POV and the New York Times. They showed some short films and had a roundtable discussion about working with the NY Times and using them as a platform to launch serious topics about confronting racism by taking a documentary approach as opposed to a click bait route.So, they got to #AwkwardRaceQuestions part, where they get questions and hopefully tackle those ideas in the months to come. I have written a question “Why do people want to ‘tone police’ Black spaces” which they thought was a good question.But then they have a Q&A. I decided to take the next step and ask a thoughtful question. To summarize, I told them about my experiences as a black blogger and my way of using my blog to tackle racial discussions, but it always seems to devolve into a “show” if you will for White people to come and tell me what to do. However, they are doing stuff and are having ACTUAL conversations within their space. My problem is, why would a White person be treated of higher value than of my own opinions.To paraphrase the panel, basically, they told me that the NY Times has a more established brand and thus, they can bring in voices and make them equal. Sadly, I was a little annoyed by the answer, mostly because why should a media outlet have the authority power while someone like me who wants to become an expert on this shouldn’t?For what it’s worth because I did ask such a detailed question, they did want my feedback. I told them “it sorta answered my question, but it wasn’t really a satisfying answer, It’s like saying I’m doing something wrong and should seek out people with stronger reputations when they wouldn’t give me the time of day.” However, overall, the presentation was good, saved for the answer to my question. It won’t be the last time I go to a Tumblr panel discussion. But I should have invited some of you to come along. I’ll do that next time." True text

Naturally light skinned women didn’t ask for their skin color anymore than you did sis. Stop feeding into the colorism and racist rhetoric of divide and conquer by spewing this caustic narrative.

I have a lot going on in my world, to the point that it’s overwhelming. Sometimes, I have mental blocks that tell me things like I don’t deserve love or happiness. It prevents me from asking for help, especially when I REALLY need it. My mental blocks are experiences of random things that happened one time or multiple times and now, in order to reduce risk taking, it pops up and tells me things like “be cryptic to people you are REALLY interested in” or “keep working this job by any means necessary” sans the fact that it’s 11 PM at night and I’m supposed to be sleeping.  The mental blocks get rewarded and reinforced, and I’m nowhere near the person I wanna be. I want to be better, but also know that I’m going to lose more than I’ll gain along the way.  So, I have a saying “I’m on a journey to okay”.  Like… … it’s okay to talk to people with the block up until someone decided to tell you otherwise and then you can work on breaking that down.  … it’s okay to say “no” to certain things so that you can rest easier. … it’s okay to refuse certain people in your life.  … it’s okay to seek help, even if you’re not in a place to do so. … it’s okay to chip away the mental blocks bit by bit until you overcome them.  You look in the mirror and visualize a better you, a more fit you, a happier you. But it’s a journey to get there and as long as you’re okay with the journey, you’ll one day get to that place in your mind. So, take that journey. Stumble a few times. Dust yourself off and try again. Just as long as you keep walking and saying “I will become the person I always wanna be,” you’ll get to that place. It just takes time. The journey is just as important as the destination.  Speaking of help… if you guys can chip in a bit of money, it would make my month a little easier. Doesn’t have to be much. Just… something to let me know I’m cool. I’ll work on something a bit more long term when time permits.   https://cash.me/$nufuturepro https://www.paypal.me/nufuturepro " False text

Trump requested this to be cut.NASA has been granted $19.7 billion in funding, an increase even on what Obama requested. Of this, $5.8 billion is set aside for science research, including $1.9 billion for the Earth Sciences – something Trump officials said they wanted completely defunded.$37 million has been given to NASA’s STEM programs and outreach, with $100 million total going towards educational programs, something Trump also wished, and still wishes, to cut by 2018.The National Science Foundation (NSF), the largest federal fund for science and academia, has been given $7.5 billion, a slight increase from 2016’s budget.The United States Geological Survey (USGS) has been given $1.09 billion, a slight increase from 2016. Trump wanted to cut this by 10 percent.The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which faced a 31 percent cut by this year or the next, has only had its funding cut by 1 percent.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has been given $3.5 billionRenewable energies and clean energy research funding have been boosted by $17 million. Congress still voted to take away our health insurance so while  glad they’re funding NASA and that the EPA is still gonna exist, I’m cranky as fuck. " False link

For all we know her family could be deep in the Klan and he still went to prom with her. You risking your life for stupid shit. You live in this town. You know this family. AND YOU STILL RISKED YOUR BLACK ASS ON THIS GIRL. Smh okay homie. That’s another way to look at it. Still, I find this story to be more for shock value, knees jerk response of the father than anything. This is about as deep as Zootopia." False link
