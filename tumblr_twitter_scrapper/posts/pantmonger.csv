So now is the time to learn from this, and just as the entirety of the project up to this point has been public, I will also make this post-mortem public, in the hope others can learn from my mistakes. Below the cut is a lengthy read. Time to own some mistakes. ——————————————————————————————-What do I think were the failings of the project.Audience: The limited size of my reach / audienceThis I feel was the largest issue contributing to the Kickstarter failing to get funded. In some of these areas I personally needed to do better. While others areas were down to the vagaries of fortune. However it was such a big one that I will break it into several sub categories.Audience: My existing fan base was not large enough to support the funding needed.A year ago when I quit my job to commence work on this project I understood that if it was going to get funded, I needed an audience. With that in mind I read books on expanding your audience and implemented as many of the tips as I was able.Daily updates, free content, tutorials, engaging with audience etc. Some of these I was doing anyway, but others embraced and implemented. Some others I lacked the money and /or free time to implement, such as competitions. This may have been an effort to reward miscalculation.But there was always going to be an uncontrollable element here. By and large people who see my work like it. It is, without being immodest, of professional quality. It has after all been my profession for quite some time. Of those that see and like my work a percentage hang around to see more. But I have never gone viral, I have never had the fortune of cracking the number of fans that snowballs into a solid, interested, financially supporting, fan base of size. That is one nut I just don’t know how to crack. But I kept plugging away in to hope of it happening.By the end of the year I had approximately doubled my reach with 500+ followers both on Facebook and Tumblr and another 300+ on Twitter.But 1300 followers was just not enough for a project with such a low product price per unit but high overall needed funding to succeed. Even if everyone had financially engaged (a big ask there)  at $15 each I was going to need 4500 to hit the funding goal. That number would now require a sizable uptake from previously not engaged people. Too much as it would turn out.    Audience: Advertising and paid reach.Which brings me to the second way to get interested eyes on your project, advertising and promotion. Here my failures were two fold. I do not possess skills in this area, and I did not have the funds to cover realistic advertising costs nor to hire someone who would know what they were doing in this regard.I do not personally know what advertisements work best, what are the best money to return strategies or the best places to target. I went in totally blind, and that hurt the project. I have seen many posts about this very topic and how foolish it is to go in without a publicist but I had little choice due to the no funds problem.In the end I spent a small amount, a couple of hundred dollars, on things like Facebook targeted advertising and similar, but only really gained a handful of likes and followers for the money. A very low return on investment as it were.If I had more money to throw at advertising, I may have gotten more interested people, but even so I probably would have wanted to pour it into the project instead as I do not know where the threshold for more return then investment sits in this regard.   Audience: Journalists and third party coverage.Another mix of bad lack and poor effort combined here I’m afraid.Talking to a few journalist friends, few of them if any are interested in covering generic Kickstarters anymore. That hurt my chances. But ultimately it was I who really dropped the ball here.I have a knee jerk hate of self-promotion. Of spinning my message (even when it requires very little spin). Thus my efforts in contacting people were token at best. And I ignored other avenues as I did not want to ‘trade’ off hot button topics.My game features a main character who is a POC with no assigned gender. Yet I failed to reach out to those that might want to cover such things.My game is about a group of refugees fleeing oppression. Yet I failed to reach out to those that might want to cover such things.My game is a solo project by a Brisbane local and once again I failed to reach out to those that cover these things.If there was a ball I dropped, it was this one, all because I feel uncomfortable with that kind of promotion.Lack of a demoThis is pretty straight forward. I should have had a demo, a vertical slice. And I did not. While I was working on my own dime, I wanted to focus on things that would matter, that I enjoyed, even if the project was to fail.So I focused on art, on reusable in game assets, and on design. I ignored all but the most surface level code, as I viewed it as a chore. A necessary and completable chore, but one that could be done when I was getting 'paid’ for the project.   This was a mistake.By the time I realised it, it was too late to correct. I feel that it affected peoples understanding of the project, and their faith that it could be completed by me, an artist.And I missed out on the promotion a fun playable demo would have garnered.Take home - Make a demo, preferably playable.Lack of novelty / gimmick / stunning original gameplayEveryone loves a gimmick, some novelty or a truly original gameplay break through.My game little in the way of these things and those it had I did not highlight.I felt that the structured and later emergent gameplay of solving platform puzzles and challenges through the manipulation of a personal light source and sound in an oblique view dungeon crawl was interesting in its own right. But I did a terrible job of drawing attention to this.A demo would have helped, as would have more concrete examples.But this was another dropped ball and a bad one to drop when the market is saturated with cookie cutter clones and cash -ins, I needed to stand out, but I failed to do so.Saturation of the market.This is obviously beyond my control but I would be remiss not to mention it.At the moment every person and their dog is pumping out indie titles. Some are solid passion projects, others shameless 2 month re-skin cash ins. Consumers are both spoiled for choice and risk adverse and that’s just in regards to products already on the market, not ones that require a chancy investment.This made the challenge of getting my project funded greater, and unfortunately I failed to meet that challenge.The little thingsThere are also a few minor things that I felt hurt my chances.Not detailing my costs.I got some general feedback from people who felt I was asking for too much funding at 70k for a solo project. It probably would have helped to do a break down that showed how once you took out the fees (10%) and the GST (10%) it dropped the amount of funding to $56k Australian over 1.5 years and that funding would also attract income tax. Meaning for that development period I would be working at a substantial pay cut. But without making that info clear and public people saw 70k and some thought it was an excessive money grab.No physical assetsI went digital assets for simple reasons: cost control and available time.I could not afford the time needed to deal with having physical products made, sent out, dealing with refunds, damages and returns, faulty products, overseas postage estimates and blowouts. I have no experience with any of these things and the financial margins were already so narrow that they could have collapsed the project. The risk seemed too great and I gave it a pass.But people do love physical rewards, so it most likely cost me backers, but I cannot accurately predict how much.Going it alone.Yeah, this hurt me. Given the one bit of journalism about my project highlighted this as a major risk, it would be silly in retrospect to not accept that it would of influenced people faith in the project.I was blinded by the desire to make my project. I did not want to have to convince someone else to shoulder the risk of my passion project and work on it for a year with me on that basis. I certainly did not have the money to pay someone. So I went it alone, and this hurt the project. I still think overall it was the right choice, but it was a factor the projects funding failure.——————————————————————————————-What do I think were the success of the project.Quality of the promotional artHaving a year is which to work on a lot of illustration and concept probably gave me the biggest skill jump I have had since I was studying it back in 2003. This showed in the quality of the promotional work for 'The Witch Cult’ which was some of the best work I have ever done.I felt it was effective at communicating the mood and tone of the game. As well as some of the novelty of the setting, such as the chicken huts striding over a Victorian London type setting.The art did its job as well as I could of hoped, and was a definite successful part of the project.Volume of Existing AssetsI felt the volume of assets I was able to create prior to the Kickstarter going live and throughout its existence helped foster faith in the project.I felt it showed that the scope and detail that the project would encapsulate. That it was indicative of and communicated the expected final quality of the project. And that it was within my ability to deliver.In retrospect, as mentioned above, the project should of cut back a bit in this area and added more on the code front. But I am still placing the effect of having these assets going in as something that affected the Kickstarter in a positive way.The volume and scope of concept work.Similar to above, having a large catalogue of concept art assets helped communicate the themes, tone and feel of the game.They were also instrumental is generating interest, especially via the drip feed over time in the year leading up to the launch. They are probably primarily responsible for the increase in my audience size over the time leading up to the launch.   Thus they served the dual process of providing me with necessary concept and served a second promotional function. I count this as one of the projects most successful parts.Personal disciplineOver the duration of this project, while working from home and living off my own savings I managed to put in a solid 8 hours per day, 5 days a week for almost the entire year.And beyond this being a point of personal pride, I felt that helped build backer faith that I would be able to deliver the project; that it would not fail through lack of effort or due to my depression (an illness that I have always been public about). That this was communicated through the number and quality of existing assets being produced by a me as solo developer. I feel this helped the project immensely and was a definite win.The Kickstarter video and pitch itselfI researched a number of successful Kickstarters, especially around projects I personally loved like 'Sunless Sea’ and took on board their basic structure.I invested time into making little visual assets such a subject headers to give the entire pitch a polished feel.I tested with my existing audience the kind of rewards that they liked and ones they were not so keen on and price points for them.I made the pitch video the same way as I intended to do in game cut scenes, to communicate to backers the setting and its themes. Bought licences for music and at the risk of blowing my own horn, my own experiences with performance helped me with the quality of the overall video and its voice over narrative.I feel all of this went as well as I could have hoped   Within a few days I was endorsed as a 'Project we Love’ by Kickstarter.Over 25 percent of backers pledged enough to get the 'art of’ book, the comic or both’.    15% of people who watched the video, watched it to completion all 3.5min of it.This area was in my opinion one of the successful ones.——————————————————————————————-ConclusionsIn the end the Kickstarter failed to achieve is funding goal. Although I personally had faith in the product, I failed to inspire others to the necessary levels through some promotional failing on my behalf and due to some elements beyond my direct control.If I was to hit one big take home from this: You need an audience!I still don’t know how to get one. Good product, advertising, luck with journalists, luck with something going viral a mixture of all these things or something I have not yet considered. It is a hurdle, in my opinion, the biggest.But much good that came out of this, despite its failure to get funded. I made some new contacts with other games makers and indie peers.I gained new audience and extended my reach.I felt part of the games industry again, in a way I had not since the big Australian crash.I got to experience a year in which I was my own boss and got to make my own creative decisions. An entire year to work on my art: that was pretty amazing.I also leave the Kickstarter with general good feelings about the attempt. People were willing to back my project, to pay for my art. Being a solo artist, you can often feel the yoke of impostor syndrome. But a bunch of folk, the majority of them strangers, put money forward saying 'I like your work, your project.’——————————————————————————————-Where to nowIn the short term I will need to take a step away from the project proper. My self-funding has come to an end and through necessity  I must again seek employment. Preferably back in the games and general art industries, as creating things is the only satisfying path for me.I would still like to see the game itself become a reality. It will most likely happen by me working on it part time as my hobby project. But thought of pitching it at a publisher or existing game company may be other paths I could try.I would also still like to tell the story of the cult, and always intended to make a comic about it, so that’s probably the next step for it. Who knows, maybe through comics, further art and demos I might gain that elusive beast called Audience and Kickstarter the whole thing over again, successfully this time.To those who came on this journey with me, especially those that backed the project. Thank you. It’s been an absolute pleasure.Michael Fitzhywel and The Witch Cult." True text

Buy a well recommended ‘learn art’ book, and do its activities.These will include activities you hate, or subjects that are dull. Do them anyway. Listen to your teacher and do the stupid one line exercises they tell you to. Some of these feel dumb but most actually contain actually helpful techniques that you can adapt to work for you. You will only be able to do this if you go try in good faith, hunting for the dumb in activities will only make you find it. And going it alone will only slow you down. Don’t reinvent the wheel. Push yourself.Don’t lean on easy activities, the things you know. ‘Oh look I’ve drawn an eye, its so amazing. It really wasn’t that hard to do. Now I will draw an eye to impress all my friends… over and over and over…’  Seriously just stop that. Draw that which is not easy for you. Draw hands, don’t hide feet. You can draw someone front-on pretty well? Do it ¾’s. Do it with foreshortening. Suck at it and try again. Go to life drawing classes.They are great and a far better for you then drawing from photos. They teach you speed, brevity, anatomy and comprehension of three dimensional shapes. If you can’t afford classes ask friends to sit clothed. Can’t do that, do 'still life’ studies (static objects). The skills here are best learned with 3d, real world objects and or people. You will suck at first. You will get better fast.  Ignore the top 3 tips and draw what you want! (from time to time). Learning the skills is important and should be a heavy focus for the developing artist but if you do nothing else you will burn out. Take time to doodle, to draw the things that are easy mode for you to remind yourself you don’t suck, and to just enjoy the feel of it. Draw your fanfic, your DnD characters, that naked model that makes your heart swoon. Hell draw an eye if you must, just don’t show it to me… seriously… don’t.  Reference is a thing, use it.For some reason too many artists, especially those who want to do anime or cartoon / comic styles, think that reference is cheating. Or that 'real’ artists don’t use it and create it all out of their heads. This is a damaging lie. Good artists will used reference all their lives and those that don’t are usually people who have a reference 'catalogue’ as it were, memorised (so they still are using it, just from memory) or are just plain lying. The old masters used reference and so should you.  Copying is an alright place to start.Even tracing at the very start. Drawing the same picture as someone else can teach you a lot, especially early on. After a while your skills will develop and it will be time to push in a different direction. But early on, go nuts. Just credit the original artist, not doing so is a dick move (same rule if direct copying from photos) Pick a focus, but remember to work outside it from time to time.People, environments, vehicles, flowers, fantasy monsters, anime, ink, paint etc etc. Focus will help you become a better artist, most of us have things we do better, specialities. But don’t neglect the other stuff.  Don’t draw a picture, a fully detailed bit at a time.This is weirdly narrow for this list, but is so common when people start it needs mentioning. Don’t fully detail a bit of your drawing, like the head, or an eye, before drawing the rest of it. This path leads to crazy composition and proportion errors as you double down on broken bits of images that you have invested massive time in. Instead work in what we call passes. Each pass is a level of detail that you apply to the whole image, and as each pass is finished its like watching the whole image is coming into focus. So, for example, the first pass may be a rough layout sketch. So sketch the whole picture to that level. The next may be solid lines, add solid lines to everything, next shadow… you get the point. This way you can see early on if there are errors and they can be corrected (or restarted) with minimal loss of time and effort. And as a side benefit the image on average will look better as the noise and tonality of the piece as a whole will influence you and make it all gel together better as a single coherent image. (That last bit is a kind of abstract element there, but if you don’t 'get’ that right away, it will come to you as you improve)  Accept that this will take time, a long time. For some reason people get that learning to play the violin is a difficult pursuit that will take years. Yet for some reason think art is something you can just do and if you cant you are just not arty… This is BS. Anyone can do it, but it takes time. Kinda sucks I know, but that’s how it is. Ignore anyone, any class or any book that tells you otherwise. They just want your money or to make you feel bad.  And finally the obvious one, practice. Practice a lot. Just like learning an instrument you get better by doing. Reading all the art help books in the world will not suddenly make your work better. You have to practice and apply yourself. This is the area that sorts the 'I want to be an artist’ types from the people who will be ones. But its worth it, the rewards can be pretty fulfilling.  General Advice for starting artists.

Eyeballs on artwork is what we want, and just that is really helpful. But there are lots of other, free things you can do, if you want to, that will help us.  You can reblog our work, with credit! Tumblr, Pinterest, Twitter, Facebook, showing people next to you in class or at the library, whatever. The more you reblog our stuff, any kind of stuff, and especially if it has a name and/or link attached, the more followers we get, the happier we are, and the easier we can sell art and pay rent. This is such a vital part of our continued existence and it is difficult to overstate how grateful we are when it happens.  You can like, comment, subscribe on Youtube, reply on Twitter, and generally make our little numbers go up. Even if you don’t want a drawing on your blog, hitting “Like” helps. If people are browsing your liked posts (if you have this option available in your sidebar or in a separate page) they will see our work. Additionally, higher note counts translate instantly to “more worthy of being looked at” when parsed by an idle, browsing brain. That’s the price of being a member of a social species, and it stinks because it doesn’t reflect “quality” or “innate value” of art, whatever that is, but a post with 4 digit notes is going to get more positive regard than a post with a 2 digit notecount. And really, it makes sense. If lots of people like a thing, it is likely, if only statistically, that you will too.   You can talk about your favorite artists to your friends. A lot of us idle on skype and irc all day, talking about new album releases and games and twitter beef. It doesn’t occur to a lot of us to talk about how so-and-so just did a cartoon of a fat bird that is making our day slightly better, but that URL pastes just as easily into the chat as any other. Don’t be annoying about it, but like Homeland Security always says, if you see something, say something!  You can look at/click the ads on our websites. You can disable AdBlock on our websites, too. I have two little Project Wonderful boxes at the top of my blog. They pay me very little per day, but when I need $20 to stop an overdraft fee or buy a food, Project Wonderful has my back. This has happened about a dozen times, enough to teach me the value of having that last, tiny bit of cash just slowly snowballing in the background. There is probably other stuff that I’m forgetting, so please feel free to reblog and add them.  A little love goes a long way" False text

To this end I will be posting rates in the near future for specific type of commission I would like to engage in and rates for my services as tutor in photoshop and general artistic techniques.

Just credit the original artist, not doing so is a dick move (same rule if direct copying from photos)Pick a focus, but remember to work outside it from time to time.People, environments, vehicles, flowers, fantasy monsters, anime, ink, paint etc etc. Focus will help you become a better artist, most of us have things we do better, specialities. But don’t neglect the other stuff. Don’t draw a picture, a fully detailed bit at a time.This is weirdly narrow for this list, but is so common when people start it needs mentioning. Don’t fully detail a bit of your drawing, like the head, or an eye, before drawing the rest of it. This path leads to crazy composition and proportion errors as you double down on broken bits of images that you have invested massive time in. Instead work in what we call passes. Each pass is a level of detail that you apply to the whole image, and as each pass is finished its like watching the whole image is coming into focus. So, for example, the first pass may be a rough layout sketch. So sketch the whole picture to that level. The next may be solid lines, add solid lines to everything, next shadow… you get the point. This way you can see early on if there are errors and they can be corrected (or restarted) with minimal loss of time and effort. And as a side benefit the image on average will look better as the noise and tonality of the piece as a whole will influence you and make it all gel together better as a single coherent image. (That last bit is a kind of abstract element there, but if you don’t 'get’ that right away, it will come to you as you improve) Accept that this will take time, a long time. For some reason people get that learning to play the violin is a difficult pursuit that will take years. Yet for some reason think art is something you can just do and if you cant you are just not arty… This is BS. Anyone can do it, but it takes time. Kinda sucks I know, but that’s how it is. Ignore anyone, any class or any book that tells you otherwise. They just want your money or to make you feel bad. And finally the obvious one, practice. Practice a lot. Just like learning an instrument you get better by doing. Reading all the art help books in the world will not suddenly make your work better. You have to practice and apply yourself. This is the area that sorts the 'I want to be an artist’ types from the people who will be ones. But its worth it, the rewards can be pretty fulfilling." True text

Epic fantasy, esp Lord of the rings was her thing. She read it at least once a year, all 3 books in a mighty omnibus her hands could barely reach around. Its cover was tatters, loose pages held in place whilst being read, put on the side table once passed and reinserted at the end of each session like bookmarks.  She gave it to me when was around 12 to 14 I don’t remember exactly when.  She read my Dnd books when I got into the hobby. She took me to arcades, and played pong with me on our state of the art home system.  She fell a little in love with Vincent the tiny robot in ‘The black hole’  And in later years harboured an inexplicable crush on William Riker, silly chair sit and all.  Needless to say it came as quite a shock to me in my late teens and early 20s when I found out from the media and my peers that girls don’t like these things…  Why did you lie to me all my life mother?"

But the acting, the choices. No I will not hook up with you good looking but lying love interest, no matter how much you whine, you lied and people died by my hands. Some genuinely touching moments and an ending that filled me with happy, sad tears. A good game, which brings me to my one major beef. Can we please have a female protagonist in a dramatic setting who does not suffer from a potential or actual sexual assault. You don’t go there for guys, and making it your dramatic stake raising go too, for female characters is cheap and often nasty. (props to ME for not doing this) The settings alone were already enough to convey some aspects of that female experience, predatory glances, unwanted comments, made me feel a sliver of the discomfort women must put up with day to day. But seriously, leave the development through sexual assault alone. Hell game devs, maybe have it as a tick box option at the start of the game. Gore off, Sexual assaults off. (or you know, find a different dramatic device)" True text

He was in really good physical condition, watched what he ate and had only just turned 30, so imagine the surprise. I worked with him for 5 years in his first industry job at Krome, most notably on ‘the force unleashed’ and then several other projects. He also taught me a lot about photography, advised me on my first DSLR. He will be missed. And although it is a horrible cliché people it does bring home the whole, we dont know when thing. So at the risk of further hammering said cliché home. None of us know when, so take 'risks’, get out there and go after what you want. Our time is so unknowingly short.

What I mean by this is: Say I’m Dickhead Jed and I’m an antisocial asshole.  I don’t actually have firmly held beliefs that women wearing short skirts are sluts. But what I do have is a penchant for attempting elevate myself, or justify my shitty actions by blaming or denigrating others, I’m that kind of douche.  So when I get called out for street harassing a woman, I’m not about to say, its because I’m an ‘entitled’ fuckhead.  I’m going to find a reason to decry this status.  But no one will buy it if I pick something arbitrary, like, she had hair so its not my fault. And so I will look for a 'rule’ that society has imposed as a justification.  She is dressed provocatively, so she is asking for it! And assuming that I also have a basic level of broken rat cunning, this will also shape my targets (at least publicly) so that I can use these excuses. Now assuming the above is the case, I wonder if we have to shape our responses accordingly. I think when we try and make people realise slut shaming is wrong, we have to ask is this best approach? It seems a lot of the time we think that those doing it are genuinely misguided and we need to educate them that short skirt does not mean slut, and even if it did, slut does not mean worthy of denigration.  But maybe they just dont care. They already have no particular link between their decision to denigrate and if they actually think the person in a slut, other then a convenient excuse. They intend to act that way regardless and then pick a reason that 'justifies’ it.  Society giving them these excuses is still a problem (and worthy of attention), but I wonder if removing them just means they will refocus and it will become a never ending game of catchup. Maybe instilling genuine human empathy is the way, and when a person does something like this I think we need to point out the core problem. Ie you are a broken entitled douche, rather then the excuse, 'don’t call a girl in a short skirt a slut, its wrong’. (It is wrong but..?)  However, I don’t know how to instil genuine human empathy in people. Figuring out that may be the major hurdle But till then, instead of pointing out the specific instance of wrong, I may just ask the perpetrator… What the fuck is wrong with you? " True text

Many things have been said about this by people much more articulate and closer to the damaging edge of the razor then myself. But I feel the need to throw around an aspect of an opinion. One of the parts in this that I whole heartedly agree with and seems to be the nub of the issue is of course the; “Not all men, but all women at the hands of men” This becomes most relevant when the person saying “No all men” is using it to mean “Not me” Its akin to saying, I understand that there are men you are afraid of, or think of as creepy, or sleazy. But that person is not me, I’m one of the good ones. This statement is stupid for several reasons but one of the biggest for me is the pointlessness of the statement. It proves nothing. Anyone can say that. There is nothing in that statement that makes it ‘true’ It might be, but that statement carries no proof. But the thing that galls me about it is, that while women are being repeatedly targeted by a range of people from the horrific all out haters, casual abusers and exploitation creeps. Your beef is that maybe someone on an initial encounter may be hesitant in giving their trust in case you are one of perpetrators.. Seriously, side by side comparison here people. I’m angry because someone is careful around me, thus assuming I may be a bad person… Oh the injustice! Vs This person may actually, assault, harm, belittle, degrade or kill me. This is not an issue of debate, its a reasonable precaution taken in the face of real danger. Is it fair… maybe not. But neither is the rate of which these incidents happen to people because they are women. If we can effect these real and proportionaly massively greater issues, then maybe we can fix the 'injustice’ of being seen as potential perpetrators. Ultimately being seen as a potential perpetrators only really limits our (mens) interaction with women in situations they feel vulnerable. Sharing secrets, being alone with them, other situations of trust. And acting like you had a right to and action in those situations is broken right off the bat.. Ie If you say, “I’ll walk you home” and they say “I don’t really know you that well, no thanks” sure the reason may be because they see you as a potential perpetrator, and you may see that as unjust. But you have no right to their person anyway, they can say “sorry, you smell” or “No” and you have no fucking right to contradict that. So the reason for the refusal becomes irreverent. You are just picking a point of 'injustice’ to be angry over for a liberty that was never yours to take in the first place. Tldr: If the biggest issue in your life is being unjustly seen as potential perpetrator, then you need to take a step back and realise how pissy that injustice is compared to the real injustices being perpetrated. And realise that if we could fix the actual important issues, then maybe that secondary ones might just go away by themselves." True text
