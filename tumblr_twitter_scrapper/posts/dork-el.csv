When my parents are out of town, my pup Remmy sleeps downstairs with me. I don’t mind because the basement is chilly sometimes and he’s a fuzzy little space heater. But he always does this weird thing and I didn’t figure out why until last night. I’m a stomach-sleeper, while the rest of my family are back-sleepers. So Remmy has taken up this very different behavior with me (my family says he doesn’t do it with them). It always takes me a while to settle down, but when I do, Remmy takes his head off of his paws and rests it square in the center of my back. So I’m thinking, “What’s the point of that? It can’t be comfortable. It cranes his neck in a funny way, and besides, every time I breathe his head goes up and down. That’s a weird thing.” So I formulate a hypothesis, and test it. Last night, I got comfortable, Remmy put his head on my back, I waited a while, then I held my breath. It took him a while to react, but when he did, he fuckin lost it. He started whining and yipping, and repeatedly licking my face and hands. And I was like oh my god.  Conclusion: my dog noticed that I slept in a way that was different from the rest of my family, thought “that kid is gonna die” and made sure that I never stopped breathing in the middle of the night. Dogs are fuckin smart as hell. What a wonderful animal." False text

And now I’m going to list little facts (semi-canon facts) for all you fan authors and artists for your shit. So here you go: Kara lives in Hammersmith Tower, apartment 4-A. Kara had a bully on earth during high school called Belinda-the-bully, who seemed to always beat Kara at Street Combat Six using a surprise uppercut TKO. Also there were no video games on Krypton. Kara has one hell of an uppercut thanks to Belinda-the-bully. Kara has to calculate everything during a rescue. Air resistance, negative acceleration, matching the object’s speed. Like everything. Or else whiplash could kill victims or she’ll make a cater after every landing or things would crash against her as she catches them. Our girl knows how to multitask like a boss. Kara does her calculations in Sulls, a weight measurement on Krypton. She problems converting these to pounds. Alex is approximately 31 Sulls. Kara isn’t that great with Earth’s physics. The Rokyn Society’s Gravitistics doesn’t line up with Newton’s laws all too well. She apparently tried to tell that to her ninth grade teacher while English wasn’t her first language. Krypton didn’t believe in resolving conflict by physical violence. They first exhausted communication, every diplomatic option before disagreements got out of hand. So, that explains a lot about Kara’s temperament and hesitance to start a fight. Kara talks to Clark a lot about people finding out about her identity and how it would affect the people she cares for. Winn has a badass hijab-and-leather-jacket-wearing hacker friend named Rabiah Zinoman, who can go up against an alien who is practically a computer himself.  Did I mention her screen name is RazzleDazzle130? Also she doesn’t date, so possibly on the asexual/aromantic spectrum? Speaking of screen names, Winn has several: Supergirl_In_Action252, Mufungo, and Dollm8ker (the latter being a throwback to his comic book roots). … James apparently got turned into a turtle once? (I need a fic now!) Kara had a college roommate named Donna, who was in love with Silence of the Lambs and would watch it every few weeks. After capturing and interrogating Fort Rozz criminals, Kara doesn’t like it that much anymore. Kara’s father used to say, “Not my cup of Thoni tea.” Kara learned how to control her dreams from the decades in the phantom zone. She dreamt of Kypton mostly. She used a Kryptonian dreaming technique called Tarukor for the control. She’s also so proficient in it that she went toe-to-toe with an alien known for manipulating/creating dreams. Alex promptly calls Kara a dream warrior. Kara, after dreaming/sleeping for decades, didn’t sleep much on earth the years following her landing. Now she mostly does it out of habit and normalcy.    Alex and Kara saw My Chemical Romance in concert. Seriously just imagine scene teens Kara and Alex though. Kara had a weird dream about Oscar Isaac once. Cat milks stuff for days after a Supergirl fight.   Kryptonians used sunstones as pictures. Like multi-faceted rocks with pictures on them. Kara is very proficient in hand-to-hand combat (since she learned of the DEO), despite not learning it on Krypton. Without her powers, Kara can still kick your ass if she wanted to. She also really likes uppercuts. Clark loves mysteries, grew up reading them and they are half the reason he became a reporter, wanting to uncover the secrets in people. They infuriate Kara, though, she just wants the world to be straightforward. Alex doesn’t know Kryptonese.  Alex had a med school boyfriend that used to write poems about them together like “And so we fight, tooth and claw, with our backs to the wall.” That may have been the reason they broke up. Cat apparently partied with cast of Hamilton.  Cat had lunch with Gwendoline Christie. Hand of Krypton was its justice system’s greatest honor and heaviest responsibility. They were in service to Krypton’s future. Kara went to Stanhope College. College actually challenged Kara in academics her first year. Yes, Supergirl was brought low by Professor Haley’s Oceanography pop quizzes. Kara did a huge research paper on doxing in college. By her own admission, Kara graduated ‘top-ish’ of her class (knowing her though I headcanon that she was at least top ten). Kara curses a lot more in Kryptonese than in English. Like a lot. Kara learned (passable) English in a day. Our girl is a fast learner (do as you please with that information). Midvale is in California, on the beach. Kara can fly to about 40,000 feet before she’ll be at risk of being in space.  The DEO has at least one agent that wears hijab. Clark says, “Truth, justice, and the American way,” Kara on the other hand would say, “Hope, help and compassion for all.” But seriously guys, go read them. The art, dialogue, and narration is colorful and amazing.They’re really fun and since we’re in hiatus they’re good fillers before Season Two starts. They’re about 99 cents apiece and there’s only thirteen chapters.  " False text
