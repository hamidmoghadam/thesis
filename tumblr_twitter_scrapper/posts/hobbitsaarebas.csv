This really bothered me over the course of how far I played. I would be talking to someone and they would mention something that while common in Fallout would be pretty out there for anyone not familiar and almost every time my character just didn’t care. Even when they did react (like when first told about ghouls) it’s less “What the fuck is going on?” and more “Huh, that’s new.”  Yeah! And another part of it, I think, is that the Sole Survivor never seems to react to shit outside of the dialog tree, which… works okay in any other Fallout game, since your character never “actually talks,” but it’s jarring when they’re voice acted. If I go off the beaten path and see a bunch of ghouls shambling around, why don’t they say “what the hell is THAT thing?” Why are they never moved to speak about the ruins of places they may once have visited, long before the bombs fell? Why is there no “ohhhh, DIAMOND CITY” moment, no “is that… a gigantic Mr. Handy?” moment, no moment of any kind that would suggest they have a single thought in their head besides “SON GONE GET SON” and “well this person asked me to do something so I guess I better.” ….Come to think of it, I don’t even recall there being basic touches like having them pant if they take a lot of damage or run out of AP, though maybe I’m misremembering.

What she found is that the Holocaust survivors had a similar hormonal profile to Vietnam veterans suffering from PTSD. Our brains have a region called the amygdala, which performs the primary roles of processing memory, emotional reactions, and even threat detection. PTSD causes the amygdala to kick into overdrive. It wasn’t until years later, after meeting with the child of a Holocaust survivor, that she decided to test if these traits were passed down through generations, and her study confirmed what she thought. Sociologist Dr. Joy DeGruy played off the widely accepted term Post Traumatic Stress Disorder to create the phrase Post Traumatic Slave Disorder to address the specific trauma suffered by descendants of black slaves. If the holocaust caused immense emotional, physical, and psychological effects intense enough to cause trauma to survivors, then the abject horrors and brutality suffered by slaves is more than likely to have the same effects on black slavery descendants worldwide. Dr. DeGruy’s definition of PTSD falls in line with all the horrific circumstances that can arise out of being subject to extreme anguish and distress.” " False link

I like to define emotional abandonment as “occurring when a child has to hide a part of who he or she is in order to be accepted, or to not be rejected.” Having to hide a part of yourself means:  it is not okay to make a mistake.  it is not okay to show feelings, being told the way you feel is not true. “You have nothing to cry about and if you don’t stop crying I will really give you something to cry about.” “That really didn’t hurt.” “You have nothing to be angry about.” it is not okay to have needs. Everyone else’s needs appear to be more important than yours.  it is not okay to have successes. Accomplishments are not acknowledged, are many times discounted. Other acts of abandonment occur when: Children cannot live up to the expectations of their parents. These expectations are often unrealistic and not age-appropriate. Children are held responsible for other people’s behavior. They may be consistently blamed for the actions and feelings of their parents. Disapproval toward children is aimed at their entire beings or identity rather than a particular behavior, such as telling a child he is worthless when he does not do his homework or she is never going to be a good athlete because she missed the final catch of the game.

That was the question I kept asking myself yesterday after a simple Twitter conversation about the truly awful hair and makeup options in Mass Effect Andromeda, turned into a full on session of whitesplaining by one Ms. Fryda Wolff, the voice of fem!Ryder in BioWare’s latest installment in the series.   Twitter is, of course, a public platform and that means folks are likely to come barging into your “conversations” out of the blue. Sometimes it’s friends popping into mid stream, like they might at a party, and adding another friendly voice to the topic. Then there are others who barge in like the Kool-Aid Man and knock unwanted debris all over you and your friends. One way you’re pretty much guaranteed to get the second kind of interaction is to be a black, female, gamer with opinions, who voices them loudly and proudly online. That Kool-Aid Man entrance will leave a giant hole through which will come a stream of well-actuallys, not-all-mens, not-all-white-womens, ur-doin-it-wrongs, go-back-to-africas, not-in-my-experiences and a personal favorite “you’re-the-real-racists.” These characters are all played by an inexhaustible supply of Twitter regulars, some no more than an egg, up to and including celebrities and public figures who occasionally have nothing better to do than veer wildly out of their lane to bother your average salty, black, gamer girl. What follows is a pared down version of the bizarre interaction I had with Ms. Wolff (who I’ll be honest, I didn’t know from Adam — I thought she was just some rando popping into a conversation that had nothing to do with her, which is about 85% correct.)   My immediate reaction to this tweet was actual laughter. It was so ridiculously naive and out of touch that I assumed this was some random BioWare fangirl who couldn’t bear for her precious, precious developers to be in any way, shape or form criticized, no matter how good-natured or well deserved the criticism. I responded accordingly.   It’s about at this point that I got annoyed, remembered her comment about being a “protagonist” and did a Google search. Imagine my chagrin when the clueless Becky turned out to be the voice of fem!Ryder, who I was currently gallivanting around the universe with.  My stomach sank — I personally try to avoid learning as much as possible about voice actors lest I discover they’re raging assholes, which then colors their character for me. (Please see Greg Ellis, voice of Cullen Rutherford, and his support for the abuser Johnny Depp.) Now it would have been great if she stopped there, but Ms. Wolff had a bad case of ur-doing-it-wrong combined with not-in-my-experience, so decided to keep lecturing. Here’s the thing though — I never have and never will be silent in my criticism of video game and other media. I worked for EA for six years and was known as the girl who asked uncomfortable questions at Town Halls. I regularly rant about diversity in gaming — on Twitter, on Facebook, on Tumblr, at cons, on podcasts — anywhere that people will let me talk, I will talk. Trust me when I say, I have yet to see a single AAA company really listen. That’s an experience shared by not just me, but by the many other black women pushing and shoving to try and move the gaming industry forward by milometers when it comes to our own representation. Unfortunately Ms. Wolff was under the impression she was educating me and my friends and continued to shove her digital foot right into her virtual mouth. Keep reading  This legit made me want to re-roll to a dude Ryder just because of her utter cluelessness and whitesplaining. For someone who is a former dev, she so, so does not get it. The nail in the coffin was the whole if you don’t pray, you don’t receive bullshit. Like how can you have been a dev, in this industry and think that AAA studios will just go OH, OK! when fans come to them with a legit complaint. How? This is a gold star example of not staying in your lane, and also listening when another white woman speaks but you ignore, literally ignore WOC who speak their truth.  Yup, I really sat there after this and asked myself if I could play the game and listen to this woman’s voice the whole time. But as I pointed out, SHE isn’t the protagonist, WE are, so I decided I’d do my best to separate her from my character. Still, it’s really shitty and I’m pretty sure she did NOT learn anything, just went off feeling virtuous and self righteous. Her apology was such a patent and classic non apology it could be a dictionary example. And it wasn’t even to me, it was to Jessica, another white woman. So glaringly awful. " False link

Unfortunately, Hobbes’ article is no exception. Let’s break down where it goes wrong: “Crucial to understanding the A-gays is seeing their cultural and economic complicity in the systems that both benefit them and, ironically, make them feel miserable. Please do not misunderstand: No one is responsible for suicide or mental illness—these are both complex phenomena that deserve to be addressed regardless of who’s experiencing them. But part of taking a problem seriously is understanding where it comes from. If I’m rolling my eyes at Hobbes’ piece, it’s not for lack of sympathy; it’s just the same way I might roll my eyes at an article about miserable hedge fund managers that didn’t interrogate their exploitative profession and the way it might contribute both to their sadness and their privilege.” … “  And then, of course, there’s the issue of compounding stressors: Many minority groups beyond gays face daily indignities and traumas, often magnified by physical and economic attacks. This trauma is intensified by overlapping experiences of oppression: blackness and poverty and queerness, for instance. This article uses as an example of minority stress a teen deciding whether to major in art or finance. “    @hobbitsaarebas :)  Thanks for bringing this to my attention. The more I thought about that first article I reblogged, the more uncomfortable it made me feel. " False link

It struck several chords with me and I recommend everyone to take some time to read it.  Having just read it, this is an excellent article, but it is not an “LGBT” article. It is about cis gay men, cis gay men’s culture, toxic masculinity, and minority stress among cis gay men. The article does not once mention or even acknowledge the existence of gay trans men, and only mentions bisexual cis men a few times in passing without even mentioning that their struggle is often different. If you want an excellent discussion of the struggles of cis gay men, this is it, but it is specific and targeted and relates to no one but cis gay men.   Idk I feel like this article is really talking about middle-class, able-bodied, mostly-neurotypical cis gay white men. Because honestly as soon as you step out of that tiny microcosm there is so many other elements impacting someone that don’t get mentioned here… other than a brief mention of “not fitting in” but it doesn’t talk about the actual lived experiences of gay moc, or gay men living with disabilities and whatnot. And omissions of things like the higher rates of poverty among most queer community members is kinda… well…Also like… it feels really “liberal” cause it seems to think parents who are accepting of gay sons, and areas that are “gay-friendly” are incapable of like … still encourage heteronormativity and [god kill me for using a Bulter term] “heterogender” And idk overall feels overly reductionist and a bit too “TED talk” for me.   Yeah, tbh I thought that too, but I thought it was just me.

That people like her see going to the movies once in a while, a take out dinner instead of cooking once in a while as luxuries. It’s not. Sometimes it’s self care, sometimes it’s a treat after holding out for a couple of months. Stop the idea that every day activities are now luxuries. Me wanting to see a film now and then isn’t a luxury dammit. I hate, so fucking hate these articles and people who do this shit, then folks who don’t have much get these kinds of stories shoved in our faces with LOOK, THEY did without, why can’t you? Oh you bought a coffee at Starbucks? I guess you’re not THAT bad off then?! Is what you’ll hear.

In a 2015 paper on empathy, he and his colleagues recruited 58 participants for a brain-imaging study: First, the participants filled out a self-report on their social class (level of parents’ education, family income, and the like) before sitting down for an EEG session. In the brain-imaging task, participants were shown neutral and pained faces while they were told to look for something else (the faces were a “distractor,” in the psych argot, so hopefully the participants wouldn’t know they were being tested for empathy). In something of a dark irony, the respondents of higher socioeconomic status rated themselves as more empathic — a “better-than-average effect” that Varnum followed up on in a separate study — when in reality the opposite was true. The results “show that people who are higher in socioeconomic status have diminished neural responses to others’ pain,” the authors write. “These findings suggest that empathy, at least some early component of it, is reduced among those who are higher in status.” " False link

They might otherwise face a great deal of confusion about what it is they’re feeling, but they can be aided in their self-understanding by the insight that gender dysphoria doesn’t always manifest as a neon sign flashing “FIX YOUR GENDER”. For them, it can help to realize that their less specific feelings of discomfort might also be due to gender dysphoria.”" True link

Teeth already have the capability of regenerating dentine if the pulp inside the tooth becomes exposed through a trauma or infection, but can only naturally make a very thin layer, and not enough to fill the deep cavities caused by tooth decay.  But Tideglusib switches off an enzyme called GSK-3 which prevents dentine from carrying on forming.  Scientists showed it is possible to soak a small biodegradable sponge with the drug and insert it into a cavity, where it triggers the growth of dentine and repairs the damage within six weeks.  The tiny sponges are made out of collagen so they melt away over time, leaving only the repaired tooth.  That is by far the coolest thing I’ve heard this year.  WHAT.  Me and my 11 cavities are paying attention.  please god let this become a thing quickly  I have about two fillings. I want all new, perfectly straight teeth bih. " False link
