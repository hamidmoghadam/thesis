All of these candidates have bigoted platforms. Kellie Leitch wants to screen every visitor, immigrant and refugee to Canada for ‘Canadian Values’ (and have immigrants pay for it); she has celebrated Donald Trump’s win. She’s also anti-abortion. Previously in government she was behind the xenophobic barbaric cultural practices hotline, and wanted to strip healthcare from refugees. Brad Trost is anti-abortion, is a huge transphobe (he’s posted warning about transgender people using bathrooms) and wants to ban same sex marriage. He’s a climate changer denier. Brad Trost has supported sexist chants of ‘lock her up’ towards Alberta’s premier, Rachel Notley. Kevin O’Leary has a slew of terrible, almost Donald Trump like ideas such as: Banning unions, and jailing anyone who remains in a union, selling seats in the Canadian Senate and massively cutting spending in the Canadian government (goodbye social security). Kevin O’Leary wants to run the Canadian government as a business, which is terrible for so many reasons. All 3 of these candidates are running to lead one of Canada’s major political parties. To date only a member from the Liberal Party or a Conservative party has been elected as PM in this country.  I encourage everyone who is concerned about these three to buy a year-long membership in the Conservative Party of Canada before March 28th so that they can vote for Michael Chong; he is, of course, a conservative, but a sensible and by all accounts honourable one, who favours Parliamentary reform to reduce the power of party leaders over backbenchers (something that everyone who supports representative democracy should be able to get behind) and who at least acknowledges the fact that climate change is real. If you are not comfortable giving money to the Tories, you can offset it by also making a one-time donation to the one of the other parties, but just please: if O’Leary, Leitch, or Trost win, their ideas will be promoted to the mainstream of Canadian politics, even if they ultimately end up losing the election. We’ve seen Brexit; we’ve seen Trump; we don’t need to see anything of that sort happening here.  In addition to Michael Chong, Lisa Raitt and Deepak Obhrai also seem quite moderate compared to the bigots listed above. " False text

So Leyendecker was an illustrator during the 1910′s-1940′s. His work was absolutely gorgeous and highly ubiquitous at the time, and his llustrations for the Arrow shirt company created one of the most iconic images of male beauty of the early 20th century. But this icon came with a delicously romantic twist. So this image of The Arrow Man was both incredibly macho and well built, but also ethereally pretty and dapper. But the model who the drawing was based on cropped up in A LOT of Leyendeckers work. In many he was engaged in casual social scenes with other men, in others he was shaving in the bathroom or getting dressed, broad shouldered, skin glistening, dark blond hair perfectly in place, jaw sharp as a fucking shovel, but with a slightly rounded chin. In one ad for war bonds he even appeared as the statue of liberty. This same man appeared in hundrereds of drawings, each with the same sharp care and attention to detail which makes looking at him almost feel voyeristic.  So this mans image is EVERYWHERE during the early 20th century, and he is a fashion/lifestyle icon for men on par with the female gibson girl. He was the celebrated symbol of male strength, virility, and power.  And man who modeled for Leyendecker’s iconic univerally adored macho man? That would be his lover, Charles Beach.   so all this gorgeously homoerotic artwork defined the image of hyper macho masculinity during the interwar period. Leyendecker painted Beach onto the face of the world, that was his love letter. He basically immortalised the love of his life by making the whole world adore him as much as he did.   Leyendecker’s work would go on to influence the likes of F. Scott Fitzgerald and Norman Rockwell. After his death in 1951, when people figured out that the unmarried man he’d been drawing and living with for decades, right up until the time of his death, was actually his lover, Leyendecker’s name has sadly been pushed out of the history books in favour of more wholesome characters. And that fucking sucks I would like to request a full length movie, with all the jazz era glamour and steamy romance that this genius deserved. During a time when homosexual men where thought of as weak deviants, this man not only had the nerve to use his lover as the model for all his great works, but he made him into the STANDARD of what it was to be a man.  J.C. Leyendecker and Charles Beach deserve your rememberance.    …. Didn’t Charles Beach threaten to out Leyendecker when the latter wanted to break it off?And Norman Rockwell apparently hated Beach and frequently disrespected Leyendecker in his biography.I mean… this is fodder material from relatively anecdotal sources that can make great drama for a film on paper… I don’t trust filmmakers in exercising proper due diligence in making sure these complex relationships are presented respectfully. And also this sort of changes my attitude towards the artists I have been taught to respect and admire." False text

Welcome to The Machine. We would really like to start off the last 13 eps of our favourite show with a lot more enthusiasm and excitement because the writers and cast and crew and stunt coordinators worked their damn asses off shooting in an expensive location like New York on an extremely limited budget in summer and winter.  If anyone here wants to work in tv or film, these guys are literally the best in the business and you should totally learn from them. Case in point: Sarah Shahi shot season 4 while she was pregnant and kept going as far as it was medically safe for her to continue doing so, then went on maternal leave, had TWINS, hit the gym a few months later and whipped her ass back in even better shape for her role on the show. Then shot everything, stunts and all, over the next few months and went on Nancy Drew cause the woman is a goddamn workaholic and can also balance her home life with 3 kids. The show is full of talent like this. The writers are also ridiculously smart people who have been subverting tropes left and right from day one. We have archives of deconstructive meta from our talented fandom here to prove it.   There’s only a few weeks left. Season 5 is going to be awesome no matter what anyone’s going to say because all the characters and their arcs are treated with the utmost respect in relation to the bigger plot. Everyone is extremely invested in making a story that works and doesn’t need to resort to cheap shock tactics for narrative purposes. Give POI a thorough rewatch from season 1, right after you binge through it the first time. There’s a lot of really interesting stuff about every character and how they relate and interact with each other that you might have missed because you might not have cared about them initially. It’s an awesome way to pass the time and enjoy the show in a different way. Guaranteed. So please. Have a little faith. And trust in The Machine.  ALSO….CHILL." False text
