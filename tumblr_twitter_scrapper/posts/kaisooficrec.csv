When you are just starting out as a fic writer, it can be extremely overwhelming to find someone who would even be willing to read over your work once before you post it. Or perhaps you’ve been in the community for awhile as primarily a reader and want to try your hand at writing, but you’re hesitant to approach people. Whatever the situation, if you’re looking for a beta reader (or if you’re a reader looking to beta), this blog is for you. This is going to be a place where writers and betas can find each other and, hopefully, develop great partnerships. A beta can be anything from a proof-reader, to someone that helps you plan things out, to a personal cheerleader. Whatever you’re looking for, we’re hoping to help you find. The process in which this blog will be run is that writers and betas will fill out a form and those forms will be shared here under specific tags. Visitors to the site that are looking for a beta or writer will be able to find your forms through the tags and should be able to find someone they click with. As this is a brand new blog and one of the first of its kind for the kpop community, we really hope you’ll spread the news about us so that more betas and writers will send in forms or contact the ones who’ve already been posted. We really just want to help everyone find what they’re looking for. Now, on that note, here are the forms!Writers looking for Betas /// Betas looking for Writers         ub�dx  everyone who’s looking for a beta/writer don’t hesitate and join the list!" False text

With no life to return to and his path to reincarnation blocked by hatred, he wandered by the riverside with cold, empty eyes. Baekhyun was blessed with the ability to communicate with spirits and despite of instinctive fear towards the dead, compassion made him reach out to Kyungsoo. 72 hours. That was how long Baekhyun had to save Kyungsoo’s soul from corruption. Difficult? Yes. But nothing is impossible, as long as you are willing to have some faith and pay the right price.  Note: I didn’t think it was very graphic for the amount of warnings the author gave and did not show noncon as sexy but an act of crime. fic was advertised as Chanbaek but it has more Kaisoo I think!!
