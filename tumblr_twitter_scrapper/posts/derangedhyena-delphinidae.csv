The aquarium has set up “Orca FM,” an underwater radio transmitter off the north end of Vancouver Island that eventually will relay the sounds of wild whales into the aquarium’s visitor gallery.Yet Nightingale insists having live whales remains justified, both by the aquarium’s bottom line and its public-education mission. “If we didn’t have whales, it would be as if GM decided not to make pickups anymore.”This was written about 20 years ago, re: killer whales. Absent a species’ mention, this easily could’ve been written last week."

They can pronounce a series of chirps, clicks, whistles and squeals, which may sound like nonsense to us, but to fellow belugas they convey deep and important messages. Cancer Bryde’s Whales: While swimming they tend to suddenly change direction. For no apparent reason. A bit moody. They even have irregular breathing patterns. Leo Spinner Dolphins: They have enough energy to jump up to 3 meters height and turn seven times on their axis before plunging again and then repeating the exercise about 13 more times. They are cool and they know it. They are not aggressive. Unless they don’t like you. Virgo Pilot Whales: They are amazing, very clever, witty, and practical. Until they decide to just mass strand themselves on the beach. Libra Humpback Whales: Very artistic, their songs are pretty nice. They love harmony, but won’t hesitate to fight for justice, getting in the way when Killer Whales attack other mammals. Depending on the point of view, this also makes them huge party poopers. Scorpio Sperm Whales: The most famous of them is known for wreaking havoc on a ship. Giant squid and Colossal squid are very afraid of them. Enough said. Sagittarius Fin Whales: Also known as “the greyhounds of the sea”, their open mind and philosophical views motivate them to roam the seas (at about 40 km/h, 24 mph) in search of the meaning of life. Capricorn Blue Whales: Very strong, fearless and somewhat stoic, they may appear a bit cold on the outside, but they are actually very gentle beings.

It would be a nightmare PR-wise, though. If they repossess the whales, a bunch of new whales being brought into places they already didn’t fit well in will be a very visible draw for criticism (SWSD is very full, SWT is small, and SWO has used part of its tanks for the pilot whales) in addition to them having to justify their decision-making somehow, both past and present. Especially given the awkward nature of that “breeding loan” aka excess-whale-storage (can it even be claimed that the rearrangement was zoologically beneficial and sound?)…If they don’t repossess them, it’d be a very big deal for Seaworld to have their whales breeding, when they said they were halting that. The infinite fuel that would provide towards activism fires is probably something they want to avoid.Consider also:-Morgan. She’d be left alone, as she can’t be brought into the US. Given the additional legal drama and vortex of activism surrounding her (and Seaworld’s extremely questionable claim to own her) I doubt even if she *could* that it would be desirable.-When would this action be taken? When a pregnancy is announced or noticed? If a pregnant whale is moved, bad PR. If a pregnant whale is allowed to give birth then they’re both moved, bad PR. If the pregnant whale is Morgan, that’d be like a bad PR meteorite. " True text

If release back into the wild is the goal, keep them as close to their natural environment as possible. But unlike, for instance big cats or elephants, there is literally nothing else.

Yeah, even if you’re pro-ceta captivity, sanctuaries and aquariums/zoos aren’t inherently at odds. They serve different purposes. What if you have a rescued ceta that can’t be kept in a traditional captive environment, or what if there’s no place that can comfortably take them?  Oh yes because ocean-based sanctuaries are such a good idea, gosh damn. Let’s be honest. ocean-based sanctuaries sound like a good idea, but in theory, it’s not the greatest. There are some seapen facilities out there, but most of them are small. Because, you know, big seapens can cause a shitload of trouble? I think the majority of anti-caps, the uneducated “Watch Blackfish!!!” ones anyway, think of seapens like seacoves, like Keiko had at one point. Big large pens with lots of space to dive.  But in reality, the majority of seapen facilities have smaller spaces than those facilities with tanks. Dolphin Research Center. A few bigger pens and some smaller pens in the middle. Dolphin Navy facility. Taiji. Keiko’s sea pen. (cringe at the above photo that it is from killingkeiko.com) There are probably more facilities with a seapen setup. But there’s problems with seapens. Nets can be cut. Radical Animal Rights Activists will probably try to cut nets when a cetacean is deemed unreleasable because “better to live one die in the wild than an entire life in captivity”. Yes, I’ve seen those arguments everywhere. Weather is also a problem. Seapen structures can be easily damaged by extreme weather, depending on where the pen will be.  It can be a problem to do medical checkups, especially if you don’t create a shallower, smaller pen within. There’s pollution, both physical and noise pollution that can create problems. I think seapens are overrated. Now what would be a more ideal solution is a tank like Keiko had at Oregon. It offers a natural type of setting, an easier way to have a medical pool with a possible floor that can be raised, it’s safer, it doesn’t have noise pollution/physical pollution and it offers a stronger structure against harsh weather. Sea World Gold Coast dolphin lagoon. Such a structure would also be way more ideal. The structure can still offer depth for diving, can be relulated. There’s smaller, shallower areas for checkups yet it still offers a natural setting. That would be idea. Not a sea pen.  What I really hate about these amendments is the banning of “performances”. You’re literally taking away the animal’s mental and physical stimulation and enrichment because you don’t agree with the concept. There is nothing wrong with training animals to perform high energy behaviours in front of an audience for educational purposes. Just because it might also be entertaining doesn’t mean no one is learning anything. It’s a great way to pair animal enrichment with public education. People who hate shows because it’s “demeaning” to the animals probably shouldn’t own any pet. It’s the same thing as saying that training a dog is “demeaning” to that animal rather than extremely beneficial to them. Your moral high ground should not come before animals needing a way to exercise and remain fit and healthy.  The Park Board are demonstrating to the world how bowing to animal rights activists is not in the actual animal’s interest. I hope everyone enjoys seeing stereotypic behaviour because without enrichment that’s what you’re going to get. And it won’t be the aquarium’s fault, it’ll be the fault of the park board and all the emotional, ignorant activists that pushed this ridiculous bylaw.  Agreed. Performances and training sessions are a great way to provide mental and physical stimulation. Animals are smart. Cetaceans especially. No training sessions/shows means less stimulation and more stereotypical behaviour. Maybe even more harmful behaviour. It’s ridiculous. The Park Board should have no say in them, especially because they listened to animal rights activists and not the people and scientists who work with these animals on a daily basis.  We are aware what seapens look like and that they have both pros and cons.  Have you seen the proposed/discussed concepts for the Whale Sanctuary Project? For the purpose of providing larger animals more space, and having better rehab spaces, I don’t get why anyone would be opposed to the attempt, or partnerships towards such a cause. I don’t see the self-proclaimed “rescue” facilities building expansive tanks for potential long-term residents. They just put the animals where they have the space (eg. pilot whales at SWO) or send them to other facilities.  Tanks are better for more critical medical cases and short-term housing, but balking at the idea of a sanctuary because of The Ocean hearkens to the Ocean Is Scary, Captivity Is Safer mentality which I think is very harmful to conservation efforts. Perhaps if people had named favorites they could visit, learn about, and see - they would feel much more inclined towards activism in their community to protect the waterways and assist the marine environment directly. The well-being of something they directly care about is on the line, rather than the more abstract concept of wild animals. I truly believe this is why we have people so staunchly defending captivity - they are attached to the animals and are defending the situation from perceived threats. Would it not make more sense to direct that inclination constructively? In recent history I can only think of the net being cut on that place in Japan, and the dolphins didn’t even leave. I would think security would be important for any sanctuary facility. I can picture poor behavior from both sides of the extremism scale. As for the shows thing… I don’t necessarily think that the shows are ‘demeaning’, just a bit ridiculous. I do think they link the animals to an outdated concept (people expect dolphin shows at a place holding dolphins.) Did this expectation not evolve from the initial/past presentation of dolphins as entertainment? I’m concerned that further propagation of shows will just continue to reinforce that link. That the NOAA has to clarify to people that wild animals aren’t like the “friendly, trained” ones and thus can’t be approached/treated similarly seems to indicate that people are taking away the wrong message from these interactions. I’ve often seen the assertion that without shows, the animals will not have enrichment (any?) and suffer as a result. Are there no other means of enrichment or exercise for the animals besides having them perform -for the public-? I’m not against training the animals for their own well being (including exercise regimens/etc). There’s nothing in the amendments that says the trainers cannot train, exercise, or provide enrichment to the animals, they just can’t make it a public spectacle. It is a separate but related concern that the predominant form of enrichment provided to cetaceans is shows. It seems suspect that the entire concept of their captivity must include performance or they suffer. Doesn’t that point to the extreme deprivation inherent in their “habitat”? I would think anyone interested in these animals’ welfare would want to improve the habitat or put an end to such a distressing situation? If I had x animal in a pen and the main reason it wasn’t completely destroyed by stereotypy is because I came in every day to extensively interact with it, I’d be horrified by the situation and certainly not want to subject additional animals to it? It’s really, really weird to blame “the activists” for the problems ultimately caused by the setting. A setting which few places have worked to improve meaningfully for many years now.      For real. And like I said, even if you are pro-captivity, there are benefits to sanctuaries. Zoos, aquariums, and theme parks are built for people and sanctuaries are built for animals. That sounds like I’m dissing zoos but I promise I’m not. But it does mean that zoos have more limits that can make it difficult to accommodate every animal that gets rescued.  You can’t deny that there are many cetacean species that straight up do poorly in traditional captivity. I’m talking “don’t live longer than a few years” poorly. These are often deep sea or open water species, such as dwarf sperm whales and pygmy killer whales. (the latter are also known to be aggressive in captivity) Zoos and aquariums just aren’t interested in trying to create long-term accommodations for species that they aren’t breeding. But an ocean sanctuary that can easily be altered and expanded could experiment with keeping these species and make more of an effort to accommodate them. Like you say, currently rescued cetas are just put where there is space and may not be getting what’s best for them.  And lots of places train animals for enrichment without doing shows. No one said training would stop entirely. And I take no issue with educational shows, but like you say, a lot of shows even in “education focused” places perpetuate the image of dolphins as friendly performers rather than wild animals. That’s like, the opposite of educational.  Side note, I never considered the possibility of ocean sanctuaries better encouraging marine conservation. That’s a great point.  I understand that sanctuaries sound ideal and perfect but I honestly don’t get how people are proposing to fund it. It would be awesome if people wanted to come out and pay money to watch whales in a sea pen, but it really would be difficult to sell once the novelty wore off. The average person doesn’t want to be lectured at. You have to give them a reason or a motivation to listen - entertaining them helps them learn.  Also how are they going to sustain populations of cetaceans eating hundreds of pounds of fish a day? How will they pay the staff to maintain the pens? Will they have trainers to work on enrichment programs or do they think that sitting in a sea pen is enough? After the Keiko Release Project failed miserably at trying to maintain just 1 killer whale in a sea pen (overweight, logging constantly, lethargic) and had to get in people who worked in the zoological industry to help… I can’t help but feel cynical about the same sort of people working on the Whale Sanctuary.  Also I don’t think the Vancouver Aquarium actually does flashy shows. It’s mostly training sessions and enrichment that the public can watch. It just feels ridiculous barring the public from watching animals receive their daily enrichment and training. And is there even a place the animals could safely exercise high energy behaviours out of public view?  As for the idea that the shows make people want to interact with wild cetaceans… I really don’t think so. What’s worse is when videos of people interacting with wild cetaceans go viral and are glorified. And what about the anti-cap rhetoric about how killer whales are peaceful and friendly in the wild? Like when Blackfish used footage of Luna the unnaturally habituated orca and said that they “intuitively want to be your companion.” That more dangerous than trainers interacting safely with animals in a controlled setting and educating about them. I understand the passion and the push for this ban but the animals that currently live at the aquarium have to come first. Until the park board can prove that they’re doing this for the best interests of the actual animals and not to appease a small group of activists, I can’t see any point to it.  Like @theincredibleorca mentioned, cetacean sanctuaries could be funded just the same way other big sanctuaries are. This is also why I’m a bit mystified by the lack of participation from self-proclaimed rescue/conservation orgs - these things could potentially help their mission, they could help too if they could get past, presumably, perceiving it as association with extremism (which the sanctuary concept has no aim to be a form of)? The Whale Sanctuary Project has the mind to have an area for visitors to view the ambassador animals (unreleasable permanent residents), while keeping areas away from the public for more delicate rehab work. And I don’t think anyone wants the animals just sitting about in sea pens - they’d be provided appropriate stimulation, as the whole idea is to increase their welfare, not compromise it. The situation and setup with Keiko was the first, and only, of its kind. I feel it’s a little disingenuous to assume all future efforts will have the exact same pitfalls. If nothing else it gives a baseline of what to do/what not to do. I don’t expect that the sanctuary concept will be 100% perfect out the gate - but it isn’t as if the alternatives are perfect either, and it musn’t be forgotten that the captive industry is built on many years and many bodies. Assuming the entire sanctuary concept will inevitably be deeply flawed (in a way that cannot/will not be improved upon) seems unfair - honestly in terms of rescue and long-term housing, I’d think people would be excited about the prospect of increasing capability, capacity, and very likely well-being? As for VanAq - I watched several recordings of their shows. They’re not that flashy, no. The way the amendment is worded (to me) implies that you cannot say “hey, come watch this, it’s a display.” I’m sure they could do the needed exercises either before the public arrives/after they leave, or just do them an the public could passively view? The tl;dr is that I don’t see the necessary stimulation being outright banned at all - so it’s not really an issue that impacts anything but the visitors. And the other changes don’t negatively impact animal welfare at all?  I agree that it’s bad for interactions with wild cetaceans to be glorified or made into anything they’re not. I am always pleased to see the follow-ups to stories about people massively breaking rules -> people getting in trouble. It just seems that the spectacle of a trained cetacean responding (in a content ranging from mere display of behavior to full on anthropomorphism) ingrains the concept that they’re our buddies and can be approached unconditionally, on a deep and cultural level. (related: I can’t count the amount of times I’ve heard random tourists downtown exclaim any orca imagery = Shamu(s).)Again, I don’t think the amendments stand to negatively impact VanAq’s 3 cetas in any way. I know there’s concerns about them being unable to bring in rescues, but in 50+ years they’ve apparently only brought in 6. 3 of which are there currently. They’re not really a hotbed of cetacean rescue so the impact seems negligible.They’ve lost more animals in the past several years than they have, right now. I remain leery of the welfare commitment of any institution participating in the Russian beluga debacle (I know they didn’t participate directly, but they did provide input and definitely stood to benefit.) I also have huge, huge concerns of their actual commitments to conservation, given their silence on environmentally-high-impact projects. I used to think better of them, but that’s waned severely the more I’ve learned. I personally don’t think the changes are coming from the wrong place at all." False link

Yeah, even if you’re pro-ceta captivity, sanctuaries and aquariums/zoos aren’t inherently at odds. They serve different purposes. What if you have a rescued ceta that can’t be kept in a traditional captive environment, or what if there’s no place that can comfortably take them?  Oh yes because ocean-based sanctuaries are such a good idea, gosh damn. Let’s be honest. ocean-based sanctuaries sound like a good idea, but in theory, it’s not the greatest. There are some seapen facilities out there, but most of them are small. Because, you know, big seapens can cause a shitload of trouble? I think the majority of anti-caps, the uneducated “Watch Blackfish!!!” ones anyway, think of seapens like seacoves, like Keiko had at one point. Big large pens with lots of space to dive.  But in reality, the majority of seapen facilities have smaller spaces than those facilities with tanks. Dolphin Research Center.
