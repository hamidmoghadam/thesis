If anything I wanted more from this book, I wanted more of it. The briefness lets you in, shows its depth, but then shuts you out just as quickly to move on to the next.Like the best writing I’ve been reading from strong memorists like Cheryl Strayed, Ariel Levy, Augustan Burroughs, this character feels real. It’s like we’re getting access to her private blog/diary, but the writing is so good you know it had to be published. Andrea is born a New Yorker, leaves and returns and is struggling to find her own life in the city she has always known. The adventures of her twenties and thirties would be fluffy-light Sex In The City fan fiction in another writer’s hands, but instead you’re getting to know this character through her private moments, her family history (and present), her career path, her stalled passions and dead end relationships (there’s plenty of sex in this city, but it isn’t made so big a deal that it’s a distraction or untrue). She’s a painter who stops painting when she loses sight of her muse. She’s a romantic who drops to the lower denominator of her partner at any given time. She’s a daughter and a sister and an aunt who fails so realistically in each of those relationships that you’re seeing yourself in her. And that’s the trick that Attenberg manages beautifully here - I’m relating deeply to this person I have less in common with than I do have in common with - beyond our mutual love of New York City.It deals with some heavy shit - drugs, family, peer pressure, bad jobs, bad sex, the burdens of having two X chromosomes dealing with those XY sets, but her flaws and problems don’t stop you for cheering for her even when she doesn’t deserve it. Her failings serve to endear her as someone real - a difficult task in fiction and worth enjoying when someone reaches there. I could’ve read a lot more about Andrea and I look forward to what Jami Attenberg decides to do next. (Go read The Middlesteins). All Grown Up is a better novel for Graduates today than almost anything else (and certainly more useful than The Places You Will Go), but it feels good to read at anytime in your life when you want to wear someone else’s shoes.

But he should be heard and this collection of his dispatches for Rolling Stone from 2015-16 is your second chance. I would have enjoyed the book more if the ending were different, but it’s not something to fault Taibbi for, as he was speaking the truth throughout and this book is proof. It’s painful to read in retrospect, something Taibbi works to overcome with a fantastic introduction and epilogue and a few footnotes throughout. It’s cliche to point out that Taibbi is the new HST at Rolling Stone, but his writing is so sharp (and he’s more academic, which is a necessary upgrade for a HST today in this Fake News world) and insults so original, we shouldn’t take it for granted. He’s still must-read in today’s inflated oversaturated media landscape. Better than most, he saw Trump coming, explained it clearly but also explained it away, and I commend him in publishing this collection so we can relive the highs and lows and see where America went so very wrong. Let’s hope Taibbi has much more to say on the subject. I don’t recommend that everyone look back over the last two years of campaign hell (I wanted to quit many times, but he reminded me that this WAS funny in the moment - although I would’ve left out the liveblog debate & casting segments for not aging well), but there’s no better guide for these dark times.Here’s some of my favorite highlights:Donald Trump’s innovation was to recognize what a bad TV show the campaign was. Any program that tried to make stars out of human sedatives like Scott Walker and Lindsey Graham needed new producers and a new script.…Editorially the press denounced him, but it never turned the cameras off.…in the modern Republican Party, making sense is a secondary consideration.…Trump is striking a chord with people who are feeling the squeeze in a less secure world and want to blame someone—the government, immigrants, political correctness, “incompetents,” “dummies,” Megyn Kelly, whoever—for their problems.…Donald Trump, if elected, would find a way to turn being the president into a moneymaking operation.…Like autoerotic asphyxiation, supporting Donald Trump is an activity many people prefer to enjoy in a private setting, like in a shower or a voting booth.…Trump found the flaw in the American Death Star. It doesn’t know how to turn the cameras off, even when it’s filming its own demise.…If you could somehow run simulations where Bush was repeatedly shipwrecked on a desert island with 20 other adults chosen at random, he would be the last person listened to by the group every single time.…Trump’s naked disdain for the less-glamorous American flyover provinces he somehow keeps winning by massive margins continued to be one of the livelier comic subplots of the campaign.…If this isn’t the end for the Republican Party, it’ll be a shame. They dominated American political life for 50 years and were never anything but monsters. They bred in their voters the incredible attitude that Republicans were the only people within our borders who raised children, loved their country, died in battle or paid taxes. They even sullied the word “American” by insisting they were the only real ones.…Trump has turned the new Republican Party into high school. It will be cruel, clique-y and ruled by insult kings like himself and Ann Coulter, whose headline description of Cruz (“Tracy Flick With a Dick”) will always resonate with Trump voters more than a thousand George Will columns.…Trump is going to lose this election, then live on as the reason for an emboldened, even less-responsive oligarchy. And you thought this election season couldn’t get any worse.…Pence redefines boring. He makes Al Gore seem like the Wu-Tang Clan.…How Giuliani isn’t Trump’s running mate, no one will ever understand. Theirs is the most passionate television love story since Beavis and Butt-head. Every time Trump says something nuts, Giuliani either co-signs it or outdoes him. They will probably spend the years after the election doing prostate-medicine commercials together.…As always, the Republicans acted far too late in disavowing vicious and disgusting behavior in their ranks. Then again, it’s hard to keep the loons out when you’re scraping to find people willing to sell rich-friendly policies to a broke population.…Trump can’t win. Our national experiment can’t end because one aging narcissist got bored of sex and food. Not even America deserves that.…Those of us whose job it is to cover campaigns long ago grew accustomed to treating The People as a kind of dumb animal, whose behavior could sometimes be unpredictable but, in the end, almost always did what it was told.…From a personality standpoint, Obama is everything Trump isn’t. He’s in control of his emotions, thick-skinned, self-aware, ingratiating, strategic and temperamentally (if not politically) consistent. A striking quality of Obama as president is that he did his job without seeming to need to take credit for things all of the time, which kept the political price down on many of his decisions.

This fourth-estate awareness is something we take for granted now, a story about the story every time there’s a story in the first place (and still even happens when there isn’t a story but should be), but this book stands out (and stands the test of time) as one of the first to do this, coming of course from the outsider platform of Rolling Stone and on the wave of campaign interest in the success of The Selling of the President book among others.Crouse writes brilliantly in keeping the focus on the reporters covering the primaries, Nixon’s campaign, and McGovern’s campaign. He integrates himself into the pack to understand the pack mentality, then steps back outside of it to profile reports who are trying to do it differently. You ride the campaign bus and Zoo Plane and sit in the rooms covered in phones and typewriters, learning to follow the lede the AP puts out on the wire first (or hear it from your editor about why no one else is reporting what you are), and call in your story before print deadline - and then do it again the next day. Following the TV news crews is fascinating in how they frame and shape and write their story, doing a live narration over the feed (cut together with film!) to a broadcast segment back on the East Coast, all under the gun.As a HST fan, this book has always been on my radar (and Tim’s brief profile of HST, with a great story and anecdote or two, is a huge highlight regardless - don’t miss the foreword by HST, my ebook skipped right over it) and I’m so glad to have gotten to it now, as I look for when campaign journalism was honest, reporting was romantic, and full of characters.This book disabuses you of those nostalgic notions pretty quickly. Keep in mind this was written in 1972 and published in 1973, yet much is as true as ever today. Technology changed the process, but the sausage was made up of the same crap we’re still eating. If this stuff interests you, you’ll love this book as I did (but otherwise you’ll find it slow, boring, and repetitive). Here’s my highlighted quotes:[On objectivity vs analysis in reporting] There is an inverse proportion between the number of persons a reporter reaches and the amount he can say. …So George McGovern slipped right through the screening process. The incredulity of the press failed to stop him. [sound familiar?]…The press was out of touch with the public. “In these circumstances,” Kraft concluded, “it seems to me that those of us in the media need to make a special effort to understand Middle America.” [!!!]…Walter Cronkite: “I don’t think people ought to believe only one news medium. They ought to read and they ought to go to opinion journals and all the rest of it. I think it’s terribly important that this be taught in the public schools, because otherwise, we’re gonna get to a situation because of economic pressures and other things where television’s all you’ve got left. And that would be disastrous.” [!]…In newspaper terms the TV news amounted to putting out a paper that contained only ten stories every day, with only four paragraphs to each store. In fact, if you put a whole transcript of a network news show into newspaper type, it covered only a third of the front page of the NYT…The worst of it was that the networks were booming while the newspapers kept dying off. [old news, literally]…The networks always liked to cover candidates as symmetrically as possible so that no one could accuse them of violating the fairness doctrine. [if only]…In the world of straight, “objective” journalism, the more freedom you gave a reporter, the more he censored himself. “Freedom” scared a reporter out of his mind, because it wasn’t really freedom at all. “Freedom” simply meant that nobody had clearly marked all the pitfalls and booby traps, so the reporter became cautious as a blind man on a battlefield.…Shamberg…believed that cable was the wave of the future. The networks, with their economic dependance on mass audiences and mass advertising, would eventually go the way of the mass magazines. And cable TV–local, decentralized, appealing to small audiences and specialized tastes–would gradually take over…“The networks have never understood that the expensive equipment they have dictates a style, which is what’s pissing people off. They have to force behavior. When they’re on live, or even when they’re filming, they have to have something happening when the camera’s on. Everything they do costs so much that they can’t afford to be patient. That’s why they have correspondents who are always talking to give you the illusion that something’s happening. They can’t wait and really pick up on what’s happening.”…Every President from Washington on came to recognize the press as a natural enemy, and eventually tried to manipulate it and muzzle it.[!!!!!]…They [Press Sec/admin] would tell a lie so Stalinesque in its grandeur or would make a demand so preposterous that the reporter in question was struck dumb and did not know where to begin his counterattack. [1972! Nixon!]…An election is supposed to be the time a politician— even a President— submits himself to the jury of the American voters. As a lawyer, Richard Nixon knows that if he were as highhanded with a jury as he’s being in this campaign, he’d risk being cited for contempt of court. The press of the country ought to be calling Mr. Nixon on this— not for George McGovern’s sake, but for the sake of its own tattered reputation and for the public which it presumes to serve.…Other hecklers continued to jeer at Nixon from the floor. Some were ejected by guards, to great cheers from the crowd. Others were shoved and punched by Nixon sympathizers directly in front of the podium where Nixon was speaking. The brutality at the rally was the only strikingly newsworthy story of the day. It was a natural lead. Yet many of the reporters shrugged it off. It was as if the barrage of propaganda to which they had been subjected all day had numbed their ability to register horror. [!!]…A young reporter for a large metropolitan daily was so appalled by what he had witnessed that he phoned in a passionately indignant story suggesting similarities between the Administration and the Third Reich. His paper killed it. The story was too one-sided, said the editor. It made Nixon sound too much like Hitler. The Jewish readers would get upset.…“Because we believe that the public believes that the Eastern press is what Agnew said it was— elitist, anti-Nixon, and ultimately pro-McGovern.“ [fake news!]…""Their so-called objectivity is just a guise for superficiality. They report what one candidate said, then they go and report what the other candidate said with equal credibility. They never get around to finding out if the guy is telling the truth. They just pass the speeches along without trying to confirm the substance of what the candidates are saying. What they pass off as objectivity is just a mindless kind of neutrality.”…""Jesus! Where will it all end? How low do you have to stoop in this country to be President?” - HSTView all my reviews" True text

One kid grows up rich, in a rich well connected and complicated family. One kid grows up poor, leaves his family behind. (They’re white). They meet in college, bond over audio recordings and music. This bond becomes a music business in NYC. They obsess over rare blue records, where being wealthy in the city and the internet brings them what they need to fuel this addiction. Everything is going well until they fake an audio recording to be a rare blues record and stumble into something much bigger as a result. That is the book description as I read it and enjoyed it. The set up of the first half of the novel rings true, if a little fanciful. It’s a campus novel, then a New York novel, then a novel of wealth, class, status, race, materialism, authenticity, music, and more. The characters are smart, the setting is genuine, and the writing is on point. Then the second half of the novel happens, splintering the narrative into multiple timelines, blurred realities, magical realism, fugitive chase scenes, private investigations, road trips, daydreams and nightmares. A lot of it works. Some doesn’t (for me, on a first read). I felt as if I wasn’t following the novel that I was loving at the start, that it was over my head. It was hard to keep straight, keep up, and keep interest. And while it came together at the end, an accomplishment of many separate pieces to pull together smartly, it wasn’t as satisfying with the choppy build up.It wasn’t until the endnotes, Suggested Reading, where John Jeremiah Sullivan’s NYT Magazine piece is mentioned (included in Pulphead), where it clicked: White Tears is essentially A Wild Sheep Chase by Haruki Murakami written with a John Jeremiah Sullivan style approach to a mysterious record. This may sound appealing to you (go for it, you’ll be rewarded) and it’s certainly an excellent well written innovative novel that I really enjoyed 55% of, but I can’t recommend to everyone without that reservation.

When we’d talk on my husband’s last deployment, we had a running joke that we said hi to “Signal Guy Fred.”  So this continued for his entire 12 month deployment, and we made sure we said hi or bye to “Signal Guy Fred” every phone call. On his final phone call before returning home we made sure to thank “Signal Guy Fred” for his time and wish him farewell.  So, before I disconnect the call, I wish “Fred” the best and thank him for his service.

Serve on a jury - because it might inconvenience the family not to have the woman at home being her husband’s helpmate.  Obtain any form of birth control without her husband’s permission. You had to be married, and your hub and had to agree to postpone having children.  Get an Ivy League education.  Ivy League schools were men’s colleges ntil the 70′s and 80′s. When  they opened their doors to women it was agree that women went there for  their MRS. Degee.  Experience equality in the workplace: Kennedy’s  Commission on the Status of Women produced a report in 1963 that  revealed, among other things, that women earned 59 cents for every  dollar that men earned and were kept out of the more lucrative  professional positions.   Keep her job if she was pregnant.Until the Pregnancy Discrimination Act in 1978, women were regularly fired from their workplace for being pregnant.  Refuse to have sex with her husband.The mid 70s saw most states recognize marital rape and in 1993 it became criminalized  in all 50 states. Nevertheless, marital rape is still often treated  differently to other forms of rape in some states even today.   Get a divorce with some degree of ease.Before the No Fault Divorce  law in 1969, spouses had to show the faults of the other party, such as  adultery, and could easily be overturned by recrimination.  Have a legal abortion in most states.The Roe v. Wade case in 1973 protected a woman’s right to abortion until viability.  Take legal action against workplace sexual harassment.

This is why we needed feminism - this is why we know that feminism works  I just want to reiterate this stuff, because I legit get the feeling there are a lot of younger women for whom it hasn’t really sunk in what it is today’s GOP is actively trying to return to.   Did you go to a good college? Shame on you, you took a college placement that could have gone to a man who deserves and needs it to support or prepare for his wife & children. But if you really must attend college, well, some men like that, you can still get married if you focus on finding the right man.   Got a job? Why? A man could be doing that job. You should be at home caring for a family. You shouldn’t be taking that job away from a man who needs it (see college, above). You definitely don’t have a career – you’ll be pregnant and raising children soon, so no need to worry about promoting you. This shit was within living memory.   I’M A MILLENIAL and my mother was in the second class that allowed women at an Ivy League school.  Men who are alive today either personally remember shit like this or have parents/family who have raised them into thinking this was the way America functioned back in the blissful Good Old Days. There are literally dudes in the GOP old enough to remember when it was like this and yearn for those days to return. When people talk about resisting conservativism and the GOP, we’re not just talking about whether the wage gap is a myth or not. We’re talking about whether women even have the fundamental right to exist as individuals, to run their own households and compete for jobs and be considered on an equal footing with men in any arena at all in the first place.     I was a child in the 1960s, a teenager in the 1970s, a young adult in the 1980s. This is what it was like:When I was growing up, it was considered unfortunate if a girl was good at sports. Girls were not allowed in Little League. Girls’ teams didn’t exist in high school, except at all-girls’ high schools. Boys played sports, and girls were the cheerleaders.People used to ask me as a child what I wanted to be when I grew up. I said I wanted to be a brain surgeon or the first woman justice on the Supreme Court. Everyone told me it was impossible–those just weren’t realistic goals for a girl–the latter, especially, because you couldn’t trust women to judge fairly and rationally, after all.In the 1960s and 1970s, all women were identified by their marital status, even in arrest reports and obituaries. In elementary school, my science teacher referred to Pierre Curie as DOCTOR Curie and Marie Curie as MRS. Curie…because, as he put it, “she was just his wife.” (Both had doctorates and both were Nobel prize winners, so you would think that both would be accorded respect.)Companies could and did require women to wear dresses and skirts. Failure to do could and did get women fired. And it was legal. It was also legal to fire women for getting married or getting pregnant. The rationale was that a woman who was married or who had a child had no business working; that was what her husband was for. Aetna Insurance, the biggest insurance company in America, fired women for all of the above.A man could rape his wife. Legally. I can remember being twelve years old and reading about legal experts actually debating whether or not a man could actually be said to coerce his wife into having sex. This was a serious debate in 1974. The debate about marital rape came up in my law school, too, in 1984. Could a woman be raped by her husband? The guys all said no–a woman got married, so she was consenting to sex at all times. So I turned it around. I asked them if, since a man had gotten married, that meant that his wife could shove a dildo or a stick or something up his ass any time she wanted to for HER sexual pleasure. (Hey, I thought it was reasonable. If one gender was legally entitled to force sex on the other, then obviously the reverse should also be true.)The male law students didn’t like the idea. Interestingly, they commented that being treated like that would make them feel like a woman.My reaction was, “Thank you for proving my point…”The concept of date rape, when first proposed, was considered laughable. If a woman went out on a date, the argument of legal experts ran, sexual consent was implied. Even more sickening was the fact that in some states–even in the early 1980s–a man could rape his daughter…and it was no worse than a misdemeanor. Women taking self-defense classes in the 1970s and 1980s were frequently described in books and on TV as “cute.” The implication was that it was absurd for a woman to attempt to defend herself, but wasn’t it just adorable for her to try?I was expressly forbidden to take computer classes in junior and senior years of high school–1978-79 and 1979-80–because, as the principal told me, “Only boys have to know that kind of thing. You girls are going to get married, and you won’t use it.” When I was in college–from 1980 to 1984–there were no womens’ studies. The idea hadn’t occurred in many places because the presumption was that there was nothing TO study. My history professor–a man who had a doctorate in history–informed me quite seriously that women had never produced a noted painter, sculptor, composer, architect or scientist because…wait for it…womens’ brains were too small. (He was very surprised when I came up with a list of fifty women gifted in the arts and science, most of whom he had never heard of before.)When Walter Mondale picked Geraldine Ferraro as a running mate in 1984, the press hailed it as a disaster. What would happen, they asked fearfully, if Mondale died and Ferraro became president? What if an international crisis arose and she was menstruating? She could push the nuclear button in a fit of PMS! It would be the end of the WORLD!!…No, they WEREN’T kidding.On the surface, things are very different now than they were when I was a child, a teen and a young adult. But I’m afraid that people now do not realize what it was like then. I’ve read a lot of posts from young women who say that they are not feminists. If the only exposure to feminism they have is the work of extremists, I cannot blame them overmuch. I wish that I could tell them what feminism was like when it was new–when the dream of legal equality was just a dream, and hadn’t even begun to come true. When “woman’s work” was a sneer–and an overt putdown. When people tut-tutted over bright and athletic girls with the words, “Really, it’s a shame she’s not a boy.” That lack of feminism wasn’t all men opening doors and picking up checks. A lot of it was an attitude of patronizing contempt that hasn’t entirely died out, but which has become less publicly acceptable. I wish I could make them feel what it was like…when grown men were called “men” and grown women were “girls.”    Know your history.

Kimmel was afraid he wasn’t down with what they were asking. But he just said, “I don’t know, this wardrobe…don’t you have anything mesh that I could wear?”  When he was filming “Witness” he rented a small farm from a friend of mine. At the end of the filming my friend went and checked out the property as usual. He noticed the barn door had been leveled so it no longer would swing open on it’s own. Went into the house and saw the closets had been redone, in the kitchen the cabinets had been replaced and all the drawers now opened really well. Turns out that there were thousands of dollars of work and materials put into fixing up everything at the place. My friend called Ford and asked him how much he was asking for the work. Ford told him doing that kind of thing helped him relax and stay sane when he was filming. Would not take a dime. Plus he paid for a new water heater and got the sewage system cleaned out. And he paid rent to live there the entire time.  Local Carpenter Stumbles Into Stardom, Worries This May Interfere With His Carpentry  My step sister was driving through Wyoming once, near Ford’s ranch. She stops for gas, and as she’s filling up, this  huge motorcycle roars in behind her, scared the pants off her. The rider, dressed in all black steps off, and she yells at him “who do you think you are blasting in here like that, you Darth Vader looking motherfucker?”. He takes off the helmet, and it’s Harrison Ford, and without missing a beat he says “Hey! I’m not Darth Vader, I’m Luke Skywalker”  From the co-production designer on The Force Awakens, Darren Gilford: “The Millennium Falcon was the first thing we were actually building. I had been in London and I came home back to L.A. for Christmas. So I go to Sports Chalet to do some last-minute shopping; I get there early, run to the back of the store, get what I need. I’m coming back through the store, and I just happen to pass this person holding up a pair of ski pants, and it’s Harrison Ford. I look at him, he looks at me and puts his head right down. I can tell he doesn’t want to be bothered; I’m sure from the look on my face he knew I knew who he was.  So I walk past him, and after about 10 feet I think, ‘If there’s ever a time to say hello to Harrison Ford, I’m building the Millennium Falcon!’ So I turn around very hesitantly and go, ‘Harrison, I’m sorry to bother you. I’m co-production designer on the new Star Wars, I’m just back from London, and I’ve been building the Falcon.’ A big smile came across his face, he put his hand out, and we had such a great conversation — he couldn’t have been sweeter.  As I’m walking away, he goes, ‘Darren!’ and calls me back. He goes, ‘The toggle switches.’ I go, ‘Toggle switches.’ He goes, ‘The toggle switches on the Falcon. When they built it the first time, they bought cheap toggle switches without any springs in them. Every time I threw a toggle switch, it fell back; it wouldn’t hold. It drove me crazy. Please, make sure the toggle switches are fixed this time.’ I go, ‘No problem! I’ll take care of it!’  So months go by, I’m back in London, we’re getting close [to principal photography], and I get a phone call saying J.J.’s headed down to check out the cockpit, and Harrison’s with him. I run down there and I see J.J. in the passenger seat and Harrison in the pilot seat. They’re just giddy; they’re having so much fun. And then I see Harrison look up, and he just starts throwing all the toggle switches: boom, boom, boom, boom. [Laughs.] And I remember thinking, ‘Phew, minor victory. Take solace in that and move on. Next task.’ That’s my favorite story.” HARRISON FORD SMILES WHEN MEETING CREW MEMBERS AND IS A NERD FOR FUNCTIONING PRODUCTION DESIGN  Don’t forget about his Halloween costumes  Harrison ford is a chaotic-good-aligned cryptid, confirmed  Harrison Ford Appreciation Post here.He is certainly my universally favorite all time actor since when I would just be watching Indiana Jones every weekend as a kid."

CNN has  extensive and well-researched exit polls and the difference in the numbers is far too big to be explained away by a margin of error. Statistically the strongest defining feature of the Trump supporter is whiteness.  Does this mean the majority of white people actively hate people of color and voted for Trump because they wanted a racist in charge? No. That’s not how white supremacy works.  What it does mean it that, as a result of white supremacy, a LOT of white people who consider themselves ‘not racist’, ignored Trump’s racism and voted for him anyway. A lot of white people did not care about people of color enough to not vote for Trump.  That’s white surpemacy’s biggest feature: apathy to the point of allowing people to die because you can’t be bothered to keep them safe.  " False text

His new budget comes down especially hard on the poor – imposing unprecedented  cuts in low-income housing, job training, food assistance, legal  services, help to distressed rural communities, nutrition for new  mothers and their infants, funds to keep poor families warm, even “meals  on wheels.”  These cuts  come at a time when more American families are in poverty than ever  before, including 1 in 5 children. Why is Trump doing this? To pay for  the biggest hike in military spending since the 1980s – when the U.S.  already spends more on its military than the next 7 biggest military  budgets put together.  2. Trump and his enablers in the GOP plan  to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and replace it in a way that will  cause 14 million Americans to lose their health insurance next year, and  24 million by 2026.  Why is Trump doing this? To bestow $600  billion in tax cuts over the decade to wealthy Americans, at a time in  our nation’s history when the rich have accumulated more wealth than at  any time in the nation’s history. The plan reduces the federal budget  deficit by only $337 billion over the next ten years – a small fraction  of the national debt, in exchange for an enormous amount of human  misery. 3. Trump is now banning Syrian refugees and reducing the  total number of refugees this year by more than half. This comes just  when the world is experiencing the worst refugee crisis since World War  II.  Why is Trump doing this? You have higher odds of dying by a strike of lightening than by an immigrant terrorist attack.  4. Trump is rounding up undocumented immigrants helter-skelter –  including people who have been productive members of our society for  decades and young people who have been here since they were toddlers.   Why is Trump doing this? These actions come when unemployment is down,  crime is down, and we have fewer undocumented workers in the U.S. today  than we did ten years ago.  Trump is embarking on an orgy of  cruelty for absolutely no reason. This is profoundly immoral. It is  morally incumbent on all of us to stop this. What do you think?[via Robert Reich]" True text

The requirement  for larger employers to offer coverage to their full-time employees  would also be eliminated. People who let their insurance coverage  lapse, however, would face a significant penalty. Insurers could  increase their premiums by 30 percent, and in that sense, Republicans  would replace a penalty for not having insurance with a new penalty for  allowing insurance to lapse.

When his comments about pedophilia/pederasty came to light, Simon & Schuster realized it would cost them more money to do business with Milo than he could earn for them. They did not finally “do the right thing” and now we know where their threshold, pun intended, lies. They were fine with his racist and xenophobic and sexist ideologies. They were fine with his transphobia, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. They were fine with how he encourages his followers to harass women and people of color and transgender people online. Let me assure you, as someone who endured a bit of that harassment, it is breathtaking in its scope, intensity, and cruelty but hey, we must protect the freedom of speech. Certainly, Simon & Schuster was not alone in what they were willing to tolerate. A great many people were perfectly comfortable with the targets of Milo’s hateful attention until that attention hit too close to home. Because I’ve been asked, I will not be publishing my book with Simon & Schuster now that they have dropped Milo. After I pulled my book, they changed the release date of Dangerous from March to June 13, the day my next book, Hunger, comes out. I said nothing because I was neither threatened nor concerned but it did reinforce for me that this was not a company I wanted to do business with. My protest stands. Simon & Schuster should have never enabled Milo in the first place. I see what they are willing to tolerate and I stand against all of it. Also, I’ve received far better offers for How to Be Heard from other publishers. There are some who will spin the cancellation of this book contract as a failure of the freedom of speech but such is not the case. This is yet another example of how we are afforded the freedom of speech but there is no freedom from the consequences of what we say. " False text

Anthropologist Hannah Knox explains, “As technical solutions to social problems, information and communications technologies encapsulate the promise of order over disarray … as a path to an emancipatory politics of modernity.” 14 And there are echoes of the pre-modern, too. The computational city draws power from an urban imaginary that goes back millennia, to the city as an apparatus for record-keeping and information management.We’ve long conceived of our cities as knowledge repositories and data processors, and they’ve always functioned as such. Lewis Mumford observed that when the wandering rulers of the European Middle Ages settled in capital cities, they installed a “regiment of clerks and permanent officials” and established all manner of paperwork and policies (deeds, tax records, passports, fines, regulations), which necessitated a new urban apparatus, the office building, to house its bureaus and bureaucracy. 15 The classic example is the Uffizi (Offices) in Florence, designed by Giorgio Vasari in the mid-16th century, which provided an architectural template copied in cities around the world. “The repetitions and regimentations of the bureaucratic system” — the work of data processing, formatting, and storage — left a “deep mark,” as Mumford put it, on the early modern city."

There is a more nuanced version of the 10-years-out-of-power story that doesn’t write Republican agency out of the equation, and thus homes in on the single root of their electoral success and factional incoherence. “[I]t has been nearly a decade since Washington Republicans were in the business of actual governance,” wrote The Atlantic’s McKay Coppins, echoing Ryan. “Whether you view their actions as a dystopian descent into cynical obstructionism or a heroic crusade against a left-wing menace, the GOP spent the Obama years defining itself—deliberately, and thoroughly—in opposition to the last president. Rather than engage the Obama White House in a more traditional legislative process—trading favors, making deals, seeking out areas where their interests align—conservatives in Congress opted to boycott the bargaining table altogether.” " False link
