That hit me when I watched the scene. We have never seen Ed geting beaten like that, when cops and Strange’s men has taken care of him they have just surrounded him and held him or pushed him forward to walk. Which just makes me believe he hasn’t been beaten like that since he left home, which was a long time ago. Now we saw Ed looking at the guards and he had no time to react before he was down on the floor getting beaten and screaming! I think that this exact scenario has happened to Ed too many times, lying helpless on the floor screaming and begging his father to stop the beating but it didn’t stop, it felt like it would never stop. And I just can’t see how this could do anything else but bring all those terrible memories back. Then the dialogue with Oswald. Oswald says he is happy that Ed got beaten up and the look on Ed’s face is just ugh.  Ofc there are tons of emotions right there and then for the whole situation too. But Oswald basically said Ed deserved to get beaten up and I can imagine that’s exactly what his father has told him every time it happened… I hope this was a glance of more to come. I hope that we get to dive into Ed’s background and childhood in season 4 because there is so much to make on that! Sad and hurtful yes but that’s Gotham. " False text

In 3x19, the scene has “Penguin in Love” playing, arguably the nygmobblepot theme, as it appears in most of their highly charged scenes. Ed’s “You’re alive?” seems much softer and more disbelieving to me. 3x18 is Oswald’s point of view. 3x19 is Ed’s. In 3x18 Oswald goes in angry, ready to kill him. We get a very angsty, tense vibe. In 3x19 Ed is in disbelief he is alive, and I’m assuming unsure how to proceed at first. He’s testing the waters, trying to see if Oswald is real and serious about killing him. However, we get a very playful vibe between them this ep with their antics. I guess what I’m trying to say is that Oz is being angsty as hell about this and is deadass serious about killing Ed (or at least thinks he is), whereas Ed is actually having a great time now that he’s back because he missed having this dynamic, having Oswald, in his life. Hopefully Oz catches on and starts to feel the same way. I still believe he loves Ed but it’s kinda the same deal as with Isabella.  In Gotham, you can’t let someone cross you and get away with it just because you have strong feelings for them (See Falcone and Ed). They have to pay, often with their life. If Oz changes his plan and ends the cycle I think there’s a chance to move forwards, because I think what this ep showed is that Ed would be receptive to that. Oswald has already proven to be unconventional in this manner by letting Fish live, as she did for him. Ed and Falcone would be in the Gotham City’s traditional, retribution-oriented box. Whereas Oz and Fish so far seem to have made exceptions to that rule for one another, and Oswald was willing to make an exception for Ed prior to being shot. Since Oswald puts it so well, I’ll call this the “love conquers all” box. I don’t know what choice Oz is going to ultimately go with, but I know what’s been established and I can only hope. Eventually, circumstances are going to force a choice, and since we know that Fish, Oz, and Ed are working together in the finale, I hope that’s a good sign. " False text

Yes, of course both of them have done terrible things to each other, but this is Gotham and they are villains. So hear me out… Gotham could have done THIS ENTIRE PLOT without writing in Oswald’s romantic feelings. If the scenes towards the end of 3x05 and 3x06 were written without Oswald realizing he was in love, things still could have ended up the same way. Oswald would still be jealous of Isabella taking Ed’s time away from him. He still would have confronted her when Ed asked him to, it just would have been as protecting his chief of staff not his boyfriend. He would have arguably been MORE suspicious of her looking like Kristen since he wasn’t clouded by romantic jealousy. It all still would have ended in Isabella’s murder. Instead of Oswald having her brake lines cut, which is clearly a crime of passion, maybe he would drowned her in the bay I don’t know… This is not a flawless argument and no matter what happens with Nygmobblepot by the end of this season I am SO HAPPY THEY MADE OSWALD’S ROMANTIC FEELINGS FOR ED CANON. It was an amazing character development and SO important. SO IN CONCLUSION  Gotham chose to include Oswald’s love for Ed, and I think that’s beautiful. I also think the writers should have some sort of endgame for the two relationship wise seeing as they have put so much into it already. Also, there is NO WAY those feelings are one sided I’m onto you Edward Nygma you’re not slick. ;) Feel free to add to this… " False text

The Golden Globe-winning Glee grad is teaming with Sonar Entertainment to develop sci-fi drama Indigo, The Hollywood Reporter has learned. The drama, which Colfer created as a starring vehicle for himself, explores the mysterious world of Indigo children — those who are misdiagnosed but wildly believed to possess extraordinary paranormal abilities — and the dark forces working to exploit their powers. Colfer will pen the script for the potential pilot and is expected to direct it as well. Keith Quinn and Colfer’s manager Rob Weisbach also exec produce alongside the actor. A network is not yet attached but the plan at the moment is to shop the project to broadcast, cable, premium and streaming services. For Colfer, Indigo would mark his return to series regular television following his six-season run as Kurt Hummel on Fox’s Ryan Murphy/Brad Falchuk/Ian Brennan phenomenon Glee. In the years since Glee wrapped, Emmy-nominee Colfer — who also penned a season five episode of the Fox musical — has remained busy as an author. His New York Times best-selling children’s series The Land of Stories has been translated into 20 languages. The book was adapted into a film, which Colfer wrote, starred in and produced. He previously had a deal with Disney Channel to adapt The Little Leftover Witch for the small screen. For Sonar, meanwhile, the independent studio has multiple TV series in the works including season two of MTV’s The Shannara Chronicles, AMC’s Pierce Brosnan drama The Son, David E. Kelley’s adaptation of Stephen King’s Mr. Mercedes for the Audience Network; and also serves as a distributor on FX’s Tom Hardy vehicle Taboo, among others. Colfer is repped by ICM Partners, Rob Weisbach Creative Management and Myman Greenspan. " False link

And such villainous status means Gotham will soon give Smith the chance to take on the persona we’ve all been waiting to see: The Riddler. Speaking with CinemaBlend about his future in Gotham’s bonkers third season, Smith shared a few very important details about what we can expect from The Riddler’s costume when he is definitively introduced later this year. [The role] is performative; not in a Jim Carrey way. I want him to be kind of showy. So what we have as the Riddler costume is really classy, and that’s kind of what we wanted. During our interview, Cory Michael Smith was far more upfront about information than either Ed or his current rival Oswald Copplepot are. (No spoilers about the most recent episode, “Ghosts,” but their arc was beyond fantastic.) Smith was very clear in describing how when his Riddler’s story is opened up in Episode 15, he would be the exact opposite of what Ed Nygma was when we first met him, and that he would be far more theatrical in his mannerisms and gestures, while remaining more psychological in his evil behavior. Since it’s no good to style and profile with your movements if the clothes don’t fit the attitude, I’m picturing Ed getting gussied up in some of the finest Gotham City threads that criminal enterprising can afford. Unfortunately, there will be one part of The Riddler’s classic costume that will be absent from Gotham, at least initially. Smith might not rest until it happens. In his words: To give you some inside scoop, I do not have a cane yet, but I want one so badly for a few different reasons. I won’t tell you all of them so I don’t spoil anything, but I’m pitching very hard for a cane. Plus, we do have somewhere to go and add some stuff, so maybe in the future, there will be a cane. But I want him to be someone who deserves a fucking cane. He needs to be someone that’s just begging for a cane. The sheer intent in Cory Michael Smith’s voice was unmistakable, and he brings up a good point in wanting Ed Nygma to earn the right to swing The Riddler’s cane around. Forming these iconic characters shouldn’t be an impulsive and rushed process, and Gotham showrunner Bruno Heller’s approach is definitely measured when pulling the core characters’ stories directly from their noteworthy pasts. Ed can’t just go to sleep one night, hatch a glorious plan the next night, and then adopt a full-on Riddler suit the night after that. Once he becomes more accustomed to his showman side, then he can break out the stylish accoutrements. For some more good news, though, Cory Michael Smith was a lot more positive when I asked if the trademark question mark symbols would be present. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. We’re there. Sometimes fewer words are better. I don’t know about you guys, but Smith is describing exactly what I want from the first live-action TV Riddler in almost 40 years. (Frank Gorshin’s thin suit from Batman’s early days would not go over so well in this underworld.) Someone for whom every movement has a plan and a purpose, and pays homage to what Riddler’s look is without needing to directly copy it; classy and punctuation-friendly, but sadly without a cane for now. And I’m pretty sure Smith mentioned a chapeau as well, but that might have just been me thinking out loud.  I love this man. He has been dedicated to this part since day one and it shows. Seriously. Cory does a phenomenal job. ❤❤ " False link
