Meaning that relationships formed by choice are stronger than those formed by birth.  Let’s not forget that “Jack of all trades, master of none” ends with  “But better than a master of one.”    It means that being equally good/average at everything is much better than being perfect at one thing and sucking at everything else. So don’t worry if you’re not perfect at something you do! Being okay is better!   These made me feel better  Also, “great minds think alike” ends with “but fools rarely differ” It goes to show that conformity isn’t always a good thing.

Try to find our solar system. Can’t, can you? We’re just a spec. Now, do me one more favor: type “galaxies” in the google search instead, then click “images.” You should be looking at satellite telescope images of thousands of galaxies. Pretty neat, right?  When you sit and think about that, and you think of how vast space truly is and how we’re microscopic in comparison… it’s mind boggling how minuscule so many of our stresses really are. That person doesn’t like you? The stranger on the bus was an ass? You get a bad grade on something? Your boss is a dick? Your parents no longer your parents? Guess what? An ant colony functions generally on one system per ant society. They’re born, they work, they die. They build a colony, they maintain the colony, the serve the Queen, mate, die. That’s it. That’s all.  Now, imagine if this planet was one colony out of millions. What does the problems of one ant actually matter to the greater flow of nature? I know, that sounds harsher than I intended and I didn’t mean it like that. What I’m saying is… Time is possibly the most destructive thing of all (or possibly the greatest blessing of all; perspective, really), and with the passing of time, all these problems will melt away and mean nothing. Your broken heart will mend. Your grade will improve (or not, but should that dictate the rest of your life?), money will come, you’ll meet people that will care. All the while, stars will still burn, the earth will still rotate, asteroids will still move, the universe will still expand… time will still pass. 60-80 years is only nano seconds in comparison to the universe itself.  Since life is so short, why waste it on negativity? Look to the stars and see with wondering eyes the beauty that exists beyond the stratosphere. Beyond the solar system. Beyond the Milky Way. What wonders exist that we know nothing of? Look up rather than down. Hold your head high.  An ant concerns itself not of the opinions of other ants. It cares not about the resource another ant found or why it brings it to the colony. It concerns itself only with what it thinks is useful and offers the fruits of its labor to the big picture. Just because it grabbed part of a leaf doesn’t mean it is going to fight another ant over its choice to grab a grain or a twig or even a piece of trash. Concern yourself not about the opinions of others or the lives of others. Do you and just live.  It’s a hard lesson for me. I’m down almost every day. I’m distraught all the damn time and I search this blog endlessly for a letter for me. No one is thinking of me right now. That’s fine though. I’m a single mama just trying to make the best of the life I’m given before I’m food for the worms. There are so many wonderful things out there to see, do, and experience.  Hold your head up and open your eyes. You can’t see the sunshine with your eyes shut. Stop worrying about the petty shit. It’ll pass. Your love will come for you (even if it isn’t who you expected; usually, it is someone better than you hoped for which means right now just isn’t your time). Your boss will eventually fuck off, your account will get better, your fridge will get full, your relationships will blossom, you’ll get that career.  Be positive. Things will happen in their own time. Until then, see the sun. Hear the laughs. Taste the wine. Smell the roses. Feel the beauty. Don’t ever forget to take in each and every beautiful moment before it’s gone for good. All in good time, my loves. All in good time.  Live. Love. Learn. 💋 Eternally,  A Patiently Waiting Single Mama  aka G." False text

Kids should be exploring their sexuality and romantic feelings with other kids their own age, not with adults. It is not possible to have an adult/child dating relationship without an unhealthy power dynamic. Being in a romantic or sexual relationship with an child is emotional and/or sexual abuse.  Teenagers need to learn where healthy boundaries lie between them and authority figures/people with power over them.

Everyone knows that shit’s poison!” The first scary science word she uses is “Diethylene Glycol” Diethylene Glycol is an organic compound that is a biproduct of Ethylene Glycol, which is another organic compound which is used in antifreeze for its heat disrupting properties. Diethylene Glycol is only found in antifreeze because you can’t completely separate it from the primary ingredient (Ethylene Glycol). Laboratory testing with mammals suggests that it is between 2 and 25 g/kg less toxic than Ethylene Glycol, which has a minimum reported lethal dose of 786 mg/kg for humans. Some quick math leads me to believe that a person, at 90kg (roughly 200lb), would have to ingest .71kg (or roughly 1.5lb) of the stuff at one time to kill them. Medical treatment only becomes necessary if a person ingests more than .1mL per kg (body weight). That means it would take over 16 milliliters (a tablespoon and change) at once to make our 90kg person need the minimum amount of medical attention. And Diethylene Glycol is less toxic than this stuff. Oh, also, no one vapes that shit. Seriously. No one. It isn’t an ingredient. Its sometimes there, in trace amounts, by accident. People usually vape with juice that contains her second scary science word “Propylene Glycol.” Yeah. “An irritant” apparently. “The acute oral toxicity of Propylene Glycol is very low, and large quantities are required to cause perceptible health damage in humans” Next, “no long term studies” just means no data. It doesn’t mean yes or no either way. If it works for you, good. Also, notice the little commercial she puts in for “patches and gums.” Wonder who the advertisers are? And finally, fuck the FDA. That is all. *vapes deeply* " False link

As a punishment when I feel I’ve really fucked up. Have you ever talked to a therapist or counselor? Yes. I have tried several therapists who lasted only a short time for one reason or another.
