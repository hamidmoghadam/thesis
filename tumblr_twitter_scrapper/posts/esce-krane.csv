Your slow-motion montage backed by a Gregorian choir can be done with a few technques that all involve repetition. First is epizeuxis, the repeating of a word for emphasis.  Example:  Falling. Falling. Falling. There was nothing to keep Marie from plunging into the rolling river below. She could only hope for a miracle now, that she would come out alive somehow despite a twenty-foot drop into five-foot-deep water.  Then there’s anaphora, where you write a number of phrases with the same words at the beginning.   There were still mages out there living in terror of shining steel armor emblazoned with the Sword of Mercy. There were still mages out there being forced by desperation into the clutches of demons. There were mages out there being threatened with Tranquility as  punishment for their disobedience, and the threats were being made good  upon. Mages who had attempted to flee, but knew nothing of the outside  world and were forced to return to their prison out of need for  sustenance and shelter. Mages who only desired to find the families they were torn from. Mages who only wanted to see the sun.  This kind of repetition effectively slows the pace of your writing and puts the focus on that small scene. That’s where you get your slow pan. The same repetition also has a subtle musicality to it depending on the words you use. That’s where you get the same vibe as you might get from a Gregorian choir.   Damn I made relatable reblog- bait post and writer Tumblr went hard with it. This is legitimately very good advice.   For more neat tricks (aka figures of rhetoric) like epizeuxis and anaphora, read THE ELEMENTS OF ELOQUENCE by Mark Forsyth. It’s both educational and delightful, not to mention overflowing with wry wit. Great book.   Holy shit.   Forsyth’s other books, “The Etymologicon: A Circular Stroll Through the Hidden Connections of the English Language”, and also my firm favorite “The Horologicon: A Day’s Jaunt Through the Lost Words of the English Language” are also well worth the read if you have the opportunity.

Obviously this is definitely going to spoil you and I can list about 100 different trigger warnings so unless you have seen the movie and are prepared to deal with the same themes, don’t read on. Cancer World Tour We see in what makes the final cut of the film that Vanessa is desperate to find a cure for Wade’s cancer and in the edited scene called “Cancer World Tour” she does just as he predicts, drags him around the world trying every cure. As always Wade narrates the scene so he informs us that they have been all of the world and have already tried everything and now they were at rock bottom, in a very unlikely clinic in Guadalajara Mexico. Wade has given up long ago but is keeping that to himself, spending the rest of his very short life indulging Vanessa in the fantasy that he can be cured. He is in a waiting room bitterly observing the other hopeless patients indulging their own love ones, or perhaps even themselves, and he visibly has a hard time keeping his anger and sadness to himself. Wade listens in as a mother tries to pay for her young son’s treatment and the nurse very coldly insists she won’t take any pesos, everything has to be in American cash. The little boy reaches for a sucker and the nurse says it will cost extra. Wade quickly puts his own cash on the desk, saying it’s on him. Something is still bothering him. Wade watches the young boy sit as an older gentleman Wade himself was talking to earlier gets up to go in for his own appointment. Wade tells us in a voice over how he is at the end of his rope. He will indulge Vanessa, he will spend all the money that is needed to do so, but he can’t watch more of these innocent people being screwed over. Wade sneaks into the operating room to observe that what is going on is that this miracle cure is not a miracle nor a cure. I don’t know exactly how much a layperson may understand this particular treatment by what they filmed so I’m going to explain in a bit more detail: this is an actual treatment that is offered for a great amount of money and the practitioner promises that they will remove your cancer without putting you under anesthesia or even cutting you open; they will somehow reach in and pull it out of you. The stomach is pressed upon by the practitioner and with sleight-of-hand they produced a bit of animal organ, presenting it as the removed cancer. There is a bit of blood but no incision, they claim to have healed that as well. Wade waits secretly as the the older gentleman, relieved to have been cured, leaves the room and then he enters to confront the practitioner. Wade dryly remarks that the bucket of removed tumors smells like chicken, the practitioner reaches for a scalpel to defend himself, Wade has already taken it. Wade loses it. He viciously beats and stabs the man. No fancy choreography, no clever banter. Wade gruesomely murders this man with his own two hands and blood is everywhere. The staff and waiting room rush in to see what is happened and Vanessa is among them. Wade, in excruciating emotional pain, realizes what has happened. Vanessa is watching. This wasn’t a job and it wasn’t done efficiently. He isn’t being a mercenary, he’s being a murderer, is becoming what we will call Deadpool. Fleeing, Wade runs away and leaves Vanessa to desperately scream in search for him to no avail. He is gone. I don’t know why this scene wouldn’t of been included in the final cut. To me it solves a lot of issues that people have had with the characterization of both Wade and Vanessa. Many reviewers asked why, despite the fact that Wade obviously was upset and beginning to show signs of mental illness, he couldn’t just go back to Vanessa and let her see his scars. She certainly didn’t come off as the type of character who would judge him for the way he looked but that wasn’t it. Wade is reluctant to show her what he looks like now, of course, but most of the reluctance comes from the fact that she has already seen a little bit of what he has become inside and that’s a completely different story. Vanessa fell in love with a different man, a man who killed people but wasn’t violent, wasn’t unhinged. Maybe more importantly it gives the ending an entirely different tone. It’s not the happy ending it appears. Vanessa forgives Wade and despite his warning she is in Deadpool’s arms, not really understanding that Wade is gone. Deadpool very canonically gives into the bit of hope that it might be okay, someone might actually love him. But what happens next? Vanessa is now going to meet Deadpool and realize that she has to again mourn the loss of Wade who she believes has come back from the dead. Will she love this new man? Should she? Is she safe to be with him? Your feelings for Deadpool aside, try to imagine what Vanessa is walking into. Wade would never hurt her but Deadpool is not Wade and sometimes Deadpool is not even Deadpool. Sometimes this body is overtaken with pain and hallucinations. If Wade can viciously beat and stab a man to death when he disassociates, what does Deadpool do when he disassociates? Deadpool doesn’t know. " False text
esce-krane 161059134848 "2017-05-25 14:56:03 GMT" https://esce-krane.tumblr.com/post/161059134848/justsomeantifas-hey-so-remember-those-lawyers "justsomeantifas:  Hey so remember those lawyers we all saw at the airports when Trump’s travel ban first came down? The ones that were working there for free to help represent the people being detained? Well one of the first non-profit groups that came down to the airport is in trouble. The ﻿Northwest Immigrant Rights Project (NWIRP) has been issued a “cease and desist” letter by Jeff Sessions’ Department of Justice.  The DOJ is threatening disciplinary action if this non-profit continues to help immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers. Some background information: One has NO right to counsel in immigration proceedings. That means you can be removed from your home, jailed, deported, etc. without ever seeing a lawyer. It’s 100% legal and totally common, so these lawyers work for free to ensure millions get the representation they deserve. The NWIRP represents children and refugees in immigration and asylum proceedings for free and they are one of thousands around the country.  Here’s an explanation to why the DOJ is issuing this cease and desist:  ﻿“The accusation is that because NWIRP provides advice and assistance to people in immigration proceedings without committing to full representation, it is violating the rules. It’s a Kafkaesque system: The government won’t provide immigrant defendants with legal representation, and they are allowed to get help for free only if they find a lawyer who will commit up-front to a case that will stretch on for years. Otherwise, they’re not allowed to have any help at all, are required to submit complex legal documents with no assistance, and lawyers who try to help them will be sanctioned. Precisely because this would be a cruel and absurd result, NWIRP and its peers around the country have had longstanding agreements with immigration officials that permit them to run asylum-assistance programs without committing to permanent representation. Attacking them now is a shockingly cynical move, akin to sanctioning an emergency-room doctor for sewing up a bleeding patient without first promising to be their doctor for life. ﻿ NWIRP doesn’t know why it was singled out. But we do know that NWIRP has been at the forefront of resisting Trump’s travel ban. Its staff and volunteer lawyers were at SeaTac airport immediately after the White House launched the first Muslim ban, and in March it sued to block the second Muslim ban. And NWIRP isn’t alone; its nonprofit counterparts did the same at airports around the country, leveraging law-school clinics and large-firm lawyers working pro bono. The DoJ’s suspiciously timed cease and desist letter sends a chilling message to exactly these groups, and to volunteer attorneys. This attack by the government on a legal services-provider for immigrants could dissuade law firms from letting their lawyers volunteer for these cases, scaring those firms away by convincing them that immigration-related projects are too risky pro-bono projects.”  The NWIRP has successfully been granted a restraining order, so right now they are still able to help immigrants who need legal advice but their work is at risk. They are now filing a lawsuit to defend itself from the move, the move that will set precedent to other non-profits who do similar work.    If you would like to support them you can join them as a volunteer or donate.  You can also follow regular updates on what they’re doing and the case against the DOJ on their Facebook and Twitter.   (source) (source) " False text

It works by giving you ‘quests’ (daily tasks) that you are encouraged to complete each day. They are very small things and it caters to you (it asks you questions at the start about what you struggle with).  It’s designed to be child friendly and easy to understand. I’m finding it really helpful. You can also input medication times for a reminder and emergency contact details. I love this app and I had to share it with you all!  thank you for this.  “PLEASE come wake me up again tomorrow”…think of all the lives this app could save  I’ve got this app and seriously it really helps. Not only do you have a calendar to record medication and feelings but you also want to wake up every morning to help the animal. It pretty much made my life better.  @hipsterghouls  SO GUYS. Reblogging from myself because I just downloaded the app and it’s got some really useful features. In the Settings section, there is a list of Helpful Websites for a variety of different mental health issues. The list is short, but it is a great idea. The app has you input information (which you can choose not to share) like your local emergency number, local hospital, and an emergency contact person. There are plenty of activities to keep you going in the right direction. There is a calendar function and a medication reminder if you need one– and if you have an “as needed” medication, the app can remind you to take them if you check in in “Crisis” mode. You can edit or change your information at any time, including your symptoms. Also, less useful but really cute, you can dress up your animal buddy as you do more activities. TL;DR This app is adorable and will probably be really, really useful for a lot of people.  BoosterBuddy! I just downloaded this app this morning and it’s A M A Z I N G. I’m not overstating. This app combines some of the best elements and methods from all the various apps I’ve tried. The two features that I haven’t seen elsewhere in mental health apps that I especially love are: - It lets you choose a cute animal friend as a companion to keep you socially motivated. To “wake up” and play with this friend, you need to complete 3 wellness tasks (that are super simple and easy), once you’ve done your daily checkin tasks, the cute animal wakes up to play with you. You can tickle it, talk to it, and even play dress up!! Much more motivating than apps that try to make you feel connected to real people, IMO. - It includes a “calendar” feature (not a big overwhelming calendar like a normal app) that lets you add your own tasks to your daily checklist. So now, along with “checked in,” “completed quests,” and “take medication” I have an extra task that’s alerting me to the fact that I have an important phone call coming up. It made me describe this as “appointment”: “An appointment means someone is counting on you to be somewhere.” I think that might be the most motivating description of an appointment ever. As an anxious person who tends to cancel and reschedule everything, this app is already making me feel better. A+++++++++ plz download now guys  Reblogging for anyone who might find this useful, or who knows someone who would!  Gonna add on because I was using this app for awhile and I should really go back to it: The tasks are indeed catered to you, but are also catered to how you feel when you check in. So if you’re not feeling good, it’s not going to ask you to do something like, say, find a local event and go visit it. Instead, it will be something like ‘eat a fruit’, or ‘list three things that you’re proud of yourself for’. Likewise, if you’re feeling pretty good, the app kind of challenges you to do something a little more demanding-which, of course you can refuse (unless it’s a list quest, you usually have a ‘I can’t do this right now’ button that will offer you an alternative quest after alternative quest). And when you wake your buddy up, they give you an inspiring quote! Finally, about the calendar: you can actually look back on your progress. Besides giving you stamps when you complete the day’s quests and remember to take your meds, clicking on a past date will also tell you what mood you were in when you checked in that day. So it’s a great record to help you establish what’s helping you and what’s not. Like everyone else, I seriously recommend this app!  This sounds life-saving. Also, as someone who literally forgets things exist unless they’re in front of my face (executive disfunction? probably) this will probably be helpful.   So I was going to reblog this anyway, because I love this app, but the developer is the Vancouver Island Health Authority, which is where I live, which I found really interesting! " False text

I don’t want to be a boy anymore (I don’t think), but there is plenty else the world has told me I have been wrong to want.   In high school I wanted to go to an Ivy League university or a college in a city.  No you don’t, people told me.  You want a school that’s not a “pressure cooker.”  You want a school with a campus.   Do I? In (my small, rural) college my professors told me that smart people want to go to graduate school.  I applied, but said I didn’t want to study Chinese politics.  I wanted to study “pure” international relations.  You’re wrong, they told me.  The China angle will get you in.   It did. I tried for years in graduate school to not study Chinese politics.  I proposed other dissertation topics.  No, they said.  The China angle will get you a job.  I wrote a dissertation on China.  I got a postdoc based on that dissertation.  I got a faculty job in China. I spent a decade in academia trying to convince myself I liked it.  The lifestyle didn’t suit me, but everyone told me it was the greatest profession in the world.  You want this, they said, something else is just getting in the way.   I went to therapy to figure out why my brain was wrong.  Why didn’t I want what I so obviously should want?  Why can’t I commit?  We never considered maybe I didn’t want to. The rest of the world wasn’t alone in conspiring against my wants: my brain learned to chime in against itself.  My first life choice was between soccer or ballet (yes, I’ve led a privileged life).  I chose soccer because it was what boys want.  I chose wrong.  I fucking love ballet.  I learned: Don’t trust what you want.  And: I am horrible at soccer. In seventh grade I switched math classes and my friend got mad at me for leaving her behind.  I learned: Do not exert your will on the Universe or people will be upset with you.  I did not learn: math. That year I also developed anorexia, which is a lifetime sport of denying yourself not just wants but needs.  Then – and now as I write this – my body is hungry.  My brain says: No you’re not.  Right, I’m not. Succeeding at an eating disorder takes much more than willpower.  It takes convincing yourself you truly do not want what you want.  You take your want, crush it into a tiny ball until you can’t see it or feel it, and then shove it deep down, where it dissolves into your body, the last bit of nutrient you get: your dying want, as it is absorbed into your stomach alongside zero calorie pickle juice (don’t worry, I don’t drink that anymore – mercifully, they invented kombucha). Listen to your gut, people say.  Oh, darling: I shut that down in 1997. There was something I wanted once: To be a circus performer.  I almost didn’t move to that job in China because I wanted to do circus in New York.  But I did, because I was supposed to want the best job in the world.  I cried the whole way there.  I felt like an outcast until a circus moved to Shanghai and found me.  For 16 months I loved it and it loved me.   The circus closed and I was left with nothing.  There was something else I wanted, secretly. I barely even admitted it to myself.  There was a man I met in Shanghai who lived in New York.  We met right when I moved to China – even before the circus.  He went back to New York, and I watched the back of his head disappear as his taxi drove to the airport.  I wanted to run after him, fly back with him that second, build a life with him.  And maybe do some circus while I was there. Instead, I stood, heart beating in the Beijing sun, fists clenched, repeating to myself: You don’t want those things.  You want to be a professor in China.  You want.  You want.  You want. And so I was, for three years. Except for the circus months, I was unhappy.  I wanted to stop being a professor.   I wanted to live in New York.  I wanted to be with that man. One day, in a moment of strength (or was it desperation?), I acted on all three of those things at once. I have them now. Yet, I wake up every day still empty. Getting the external scaffolding of your life right is no help if there’s no one on the inside. I want. I find I cannot complete that sentence. I have a smattering of jobs and activities.  I’ve lost interest in circus.  The man and I live together and love each other.  I love New York City.  Or, I try to remember how I used to love it.  Some days it feels exhilarating.  Most it feels like prison.  I want. To my horror, I have realized that a lifetime of shutting down my wants has not only left me with no capacity to listen to or trust what I want – but that there’s no want even there.  It’s not like my want is a tiny flame that needs encouragement.  It’s that the flame went out long ago. I want. What do I want? I want to want.  I want to remember who Andrea was before I shut her up.  I want to tell whatever desire it was that was inside me when I was a little girl – that it’s ok to grow back.  That it’s safe now.  That wants are ok.  That as long as what you want doesn’t hurt other people, it’s a good thing to want.  Listen to it.  Let it grow. I am not the only person to be told what to want.  Humans have made a sport of telling each other what to want since we first learned we could. And I know my version of it is mild compared to many – maybe your parents demand you go to Princeton and be a lawyer, lest you be disowned – or you’re forbidden from going to school past third grade because you’re a girl.  My share in this game of being told what to want has actually been quite light. But even that is part of the narrative my brain tells me to shut my desires up.  Just because I have great privilege to be able to even think about what I want doesn’t mean I don’t deserve to want.  We all deserve to want.  It’s all we get, really. Here’s what I want.  To tell other children and adults out there now: You there.  With the sheepish desires and the questions and the “who am I to demand something for myself….?”.  Yes, you.   It’s ok.   You’re ok. Stand up straight.  Proclaim what you want.  Do it.  Keep wanting it. How? Ask somebody else. Fig. 1.  Here’s what I really want are some higher resolution photos. " False text

The first 24 hours of the Bionic Project went amazing, cracking the $1000 mark!!! So a HUGE THANK YOU to everyone that has donated so far! But we REALLY need to keep the momentum going if we want to see the Bionic become a reality, as the subsequent 24 hours have seen donations peter out to juuuust  a smidge under $200. As I’m sure many of you, who have already donated are also realising, it’s really tough to get others to part with their hard earned cash, even when it’s a project they believe in and would love to see become a reality. It’s hard! We’re not exactly a cashed up community. Hence I’ve decided to drop the $1500 fundraising goal to win any existing Transthetics product down to $1000.* So please, share your unique links in your Facebook groups, Reddit forums, Tumblr posts and Twitter feeds! Let’s keep the momentum going!! And if every one of you that reads this post gave just $10, we’d have this fundraiser licked!! So please, if you want to see the Bionic become a reality, put down $10, or $5 or $1 and then do your darndest to win yourself any existing Transthetic product by spreading the word!* DONATE TO THE BIONIC PROJECT AND WIN! * After you donate, you will be issued a unique link to share in your social circle.

If it really does come to fruition, this will be a prosthetic that’s a penis, and is much cheaper than bottom surgery, and actually WORKS. You could pee from it, get erections (something bottom surgery doesn’t provide). And the fact that this post only has 58 notes is a CRIME. This is a trans run business, and while the person in charge words things very very awkwardly (they seem to be a rather awkward person in general), this thing could save so much money and alleviate so much dysphoria.

esce-krane 160840023325 "2017-05-19 15:00:38 GMT" https://esce-krane.tumblr.com/post/160840023325/men-this-is-not-courtesy "worldoflis: bakasara:  preussisch-blau-und-kadmium-auch:  jujubiest:  bakasara:  Yesterday we met up with a bunch of family friends and at one point my dad asked me to move a plastic table. “Can you come up here and help me move the table,” he said, “since it’s light anyway?” I was a bit taken aback by the last comment since, well, I could just go and do it and if it was too heavy I’d notice by myself. But I just say “sure” and decide not to comment on that. So I come up to my dad, lift the large but actually incredibly light plastic table (it was something I could evidently easily lift with one arm, for reference); I realize there’s a bunch of chairs in the way so I tell my dad, who’s on the other side of the table and might not see it. I put down the table and start moving the chairs. All the while he’s started insisting he can call someone else to move the table and I keep saying “really, we just gotta move these chairs that are right here in the way”. He insists and I repeat that, and so on.  Now, most of the time when my dad is being unintentionally sexist I let him know, but this time all I could think of was that I really didn’t have time for bullshit about lifting some feather-light plastic table and I didn’t wanna stress myself out on vacation so I just insisted more forcefully on doing what I was doing. Anyway, after I’ve moved all the chairs out of the way, I pick the table back on, my dad on the other side of it, and I start moving. Immediately another one of the guys runs up to me and starts offering to do this instead, to which again I say “no thanks”, adding “this is really light really” for good measure because I’ve been here many times before and I know that unless I reassure him the object in front of me is so innocuous even I, a woman, can take it!, he’s not gonna listen. He insists, I say no again, he comes up behind me anyway no matter how much I protest that I’m fine and picks up the motherfucking table (which is still being lifted by my dad and I as we move) on my side and starts walking with us while I refuse to let go. By the time we’ve reached some stairs, another two men have appeared behind me and are also insisting I leave the task to them. Eventually they corner me on the stairs and since the stairs are tiny and I don’t want them to fucking cause an incident because they’re basically bodily pushing me aside, I let go. (Funnily enough I end up in a corner and have to yell to let me pass because they’ve become too focused on talking amon themselves and moving the table through the door in front of them to realize they’re about to shove the legs of the table on my face). I cannot tell you how livid I was.  When I told my sister, she told me about this one new guy who wouldn’t hit her no matter how much she insisted it was fine during krav maga practice. She comes from years of various combat arts. He later realized she’s trained and acted surprised despite the fact that she’d told him several times to just do the exercise as he was supposed to.  I told her the two guys at therapy will literally refuse to go through the door if I’m holding it open for them unless I act distracted while I do it (not look at them, make it look like I just casually forgot I’m still holding the door open). They’ll either bodily push me out of the way so they can hold the door open for me instead, or stay still and insist I go until I do it. I’ve had time to experiment. My sister said the men at her therapy group do the same. This isn’t courtesy. You’re not helping someone who asked, or offering help and then listening to the answer. You’re not saving women as a group. You’re not making up for other men’s sexism (or your own). You’re being sexist. You’re being condescending, not listening to the woman in front of you, aggressively trying to keep yourself in a position where you can be the sole offerer of things and the woman can only be in the role of receiving your “kindness” and exchange gratefulness for it, and making it all about your coming to the rescue - even though no-one asked you to in the first place. And if you’re so uncomfortable with any breach of the script that you can’t even walk through a door if a woman is holding it open for you, then there’s a problem, and it’s yours, and working on it is on you, not on me. Same goes when you treat a woman like she can’t perform menial tasks.  This, so much. When I was younger (and not chronically ill) I used to volunteer on the weekends with this group that did things like winter-proofing houses for people who couldn’t afford it, fixing their cars, collecting used furniture and appliances to give to people who needed it, etc. And one Saturday I was assigned–along with a guy about my age, height, build, and level of athletic ability–the task of cleaning and organizing the warehouse where we stored the furniture and appliances. It involved a lot of physical labor, including moving objects of various sizes and weights. And it wasn’t necessarily easy or menial in any way, but it was well within my capabilities and it was, after all, literally what I was there for. But I spent 75% of my energy that morning repeatedly telling the dude to stop trying to keep me from picking up anything heavier than a hand blender. It took me a solid four ours of insisting, cajoling, reassuring, and finally just outright snapping at the guy to get him to lay off and just let me do the job I’d come there to do. Then, when I finally had him resigned (very reluctantly) to only helping me move large, extremely heavy furniture that legitimately required two people to move–which he started out trying to move alone because he was so insistent on “being a gentleman”–his damn stepbrother showed up and started up with the same shit (in addition to giving the dude crap for “letting me” carry all this heavy stuff myself). Well, by that point I’d run out of patience, and I told him in no uncertain terms that I was here to do work, not stand around and look pretty while the big, strong men did all the work for me, and if he wasn’t going to help where it was actually needed to kindly get out of my way and stop being a distraction. I then proceeded to take the feather-light stack of plastic fucking lawn chairs he thought I was too delicate to carry back from him and continue with my work. That day of work got me labeled “too independent” by all the guys in the volunteer group. Even my grandmother, a fierce Annie Oakley of a single parent with no qualms about speaking her mind and making her own way, told me I should have just let the boys “help” me because they were trying to be “nice.” No amount of explaining that they weren’t helping, they were being a hindrance, seemed to get through to anyone. Nothing they did that day to try and “help” me was helpful. The other guy actually ended up injuring himself trying to keep me from helping him move heavy things. And every moment he spent trying to take things out of my hands and carry them for me was a moment he could have just picked up something else and moved it, or cleaned something, or otherwise helped actually make progress on the job we were doing. So my dudes. Listen. I am not “too independent” to accept your help or whatever bullshit, if and when I need it. We all need help sometimes, regardless of gender. But if I say I don’t need your help and you keep insisting, you’re going to get my mean side really quickly.  Ooh, ooh. So back in my girl mode days when I worked at McDs, I was heavily feminine presenting. Like, went to work always with nails done, hair done, full face of make-up… the works. And a lot of the other girls there wouldn’t lift anything heavier than one 10-lb box of sauces… and not even that if they could help it. Like, they’d get a cart and block everything to stock one type of sauce. So one day, about three weeks in, I get told to stock sauce. And there’s a LOT that needs stocked. But the cart is in use. Oh well. I load up all the sauces I need - a good 70 or so lbs; more than half my body weight at the time - and carry them in my hands to the front. Or. I try to. Twice I got stopped by male coworkers getting in my way trying to help me by taking my carefully balanced boxes off my stack. I almost had to shout at them to get out of my way and let me get to the front. Eventually I trained them to just let me haul the heavy shit and not get right in my fucking path. Then we got a new guy. Who did not take, “No.” or “Move.” for an answer. And just yanked the top four boxes of sauce off my stack one day. They fell. And of course the boxes busted open and sauce packets went everywhere. And whose fault do you think this was? Well, obviously the guy’s, but he tried saying that, see, I couldn’t carry all that, I should have let him help. Literally the only thing that shut him up was the male manager saying, “Dude, shut up. She does that all the time; she had it until you got in her way.” Needless to say it is almost a decade later and I am still livid.  It’s almost as if men as a group thought they know how much our bodies can take better than we do and thought they get to decide how much our bodies should take and how we should use them  When I was moving the big stuff back in after my renovation (fridge, couch, washing machine, …), together with my dad, my neighbor literally pushed me out of the way to do it together with my dad. He was an immigrant, which is mostly only relevant because he didn’t speak the language quite yet and I couldn’t argue with him (although really “no” is sort of a universal thing), but I was SO pissed.You know what happens when you carry heavy stuff? You grow some muscles. You learn how to grab on to things, how to balance the weight. You know what happens when men don’t let you do that, and insist they do it themselves? THEY get stronger, and you end up a little flower with no  ability to carry anything anywhere.Men are stronger than me without trying, they always will be, and I have no issue asking for help when I need it. But jfc let me do what I AM able to do. " False text

THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AUGH  Did I mention that this secret intel that Trump passed to the Russians *in the Oval Office* was about ISIS? And that it came from a third party who’s now probably never going to give us information again? Link for people who haven’t seen the Washington Post Story: Trump revealed highly classified information to Russian foreign minister and ambassador  Update: McMaster, head of the NSA, has denied this.  Good. I think we need an investigation to,get,to the bottom of this.  Update on the update: An interesting post at the Lawfare Blog argues that McMaster and Tillerson’s denials are not really denials–that they are, instead, carefully worded statements which strive to give the impression that there is no basis to the Post story, but which in fact don’t actually contradict it. In other words, what they’ve said could be technically true even if the Post story is also true. Which suggests that the Post story is in fact substantially true, and they don’t want to one day be exposed for flat-out lying about it. Reuters has confirmed the story and has provided some more details: On Monday, one of the officials said the intelligence discussed by Trump in the meeting with Lavrov was classified “Top Secret” and held in a secure “compartment” to which only a handful of intelligence officials have access. … While the president has the authority to disclose even the most highly classified information at will, in this case he did so without consulting the ally that provided it, which threatens to jeopardize what they called a long-standing intelligence-sharing agreement, the U.S. officials said. As the Lawfare post points out, the fact that what Trump did is not technically illegal (because the President has the authority to declassify anything) doesn’t mean it’s not a violation of his oath of office or an impeachable offense–or just something which could make it a lot more likely that ISIS will pull off a big terror attack in our neighborhood sometime soon. Also from the Reuters story: U.S. officials have told Reuters they have long been concerned about disclosing highly classified intelligence to Trump. One official, who requested anonymity to discuss dealing with the president, said last month: “He has no filter; it’s in one ear and out the mouth.” Lovely. Buttercup’s favorite outlet, Buzzfeed, has also independently confirmed the story with White House sources. And their sources are a tad more alarmist:   Two US officials who were briefed on Trump’s disclosures last week confirmed to BuzzFeed News the veracity of the Washington Post report, with one noting that “it’s far worse than what has already been reported.” The official was referring to the extent of the classified intelligence information Trump disclosed to the Russian ambassador and foreign minister.   Well, for something a little more cheerful, here’s Buzzfeed’s little roundup of Republican reaction: After news of Trump’s revelations broke Monday, Sen. Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican and chairman of the Foreign Relations committee, said the White House is in a “downward spiral.” “Obviously they’re in a downward spiral right now and they’ve got to figure out a way to come to grips with all that’s happening.,” Corker told reporters in Washington. “And the shame of it is, there’s a really good national security team in place…but the chaos that is being created by the lack of discipline is creating an environment that I think makes — it creates a worrisome environment.” A spokesman for House Speaker Paul Ryan said that “we have no way to know what was said, but protecting our nation’s secrets is paramount.” “The speaker hopes for a full explanation of the facts from the administration,” said Doug Andres, Ryan’s spokesman. Buttercup, it’s not a good sign when even Paul Ryan wants a “full explanation” before he goes to bat for you. " False text

Everyone is here to improve their writing! It’s just helpful! But in reality, by the time a piece is posted to Tumblr or AO3, the vast majority of authors are past the workshop mentality stage. Because, as that next to last tweet says: “There needs to be a sense of accountability in workshop. You are there for each other…” Giving feedback in a Tumblr reblog/AO3 comment makes it a very one-sided experience, which is definitely not in the spirit of workshopping. There is no sense of accountability, because only one person is being criticized. And what’s more, they often didn’t agree to be thrown into the workshop relationship with the commenter in the first place. So even if they might like the opportunity to workshop their pieces in theory, this is not, as Wong says, setting up that key healthy workshop environment, but instead setting up a poisonous one. So if you are a person who wants to offer others feedback (and receive it yourself), I urge you to cultivate relationships with fellow writers that will allow you to form supportive workshopping environments to discuss projects before they are posted in public.  After it’s up, I advocate the same rule I’ve heard people recommend using for commenting on another person’s physical appearance in public: If it’s not something they can fix in less than five minutes, you don’t need to mention it. Just try to be kind, y’all. (And if you can’t be kind, that’s what your friends in the chat function are for.) " False text

Self-interested business owners successfully petitioned the Columbia, Missouri, city council to create a local Community Improvement District, which would have the authority to impose a half-cent sales tax increase with voter approval. However, the district lines were drawn in a manner that attempted to avoid containing any eligible voters, meaning that property-owners themselves would get to decide on the sales tax increase as a way to avoid further property taxes to pay for improvements. Unfortunately for them, things didn’t exactly go according to plan. It soon became known that a single voter, University of Missouri student Jen Henderson, was registered to vote in the new CID. That means that she alone will get to decide whether or not to approve the sales tax increase. The CID has already gone into debt to finance planned improvements and was counting on the increased revenue from the sales tax increase. Predictably, Henderson is not pleased with how manipulative this process has been. She was even asked to de-register so that the vote would revert to property owners. While Henderson hasn’t publicly stated which way she plans to vote, she sounded skeptical of the proposed sales tax increase and rightfully pointed out how it is regressive in nature while the benefits accrue mainly to incumbent businesses. In a delicious twist of irony, if Henderson votes against the sales tax increase or the vote is called off entirely, the only way for the CID to pay off its debts will be to levy further taxes onproperty, which is exactly what these businesses were trying to avoid. Most of the time gerrymandering is successful and unfair, but instances like this show it can sometimes backfire spectacularly.  jakke  This is hilarious.  #POSSIBLY THE BEST POSSIBLE PUNISHMENT FOR TRYING TO GERRYMANDER A DISTRICT INTO HAVING NO VOTERS#GERRYMANDERING A DISTRICT INTO HAVING ONE VOTER#AND SHE’S PISSED (via soundingonlyatnightasyousleep)  AMAZING  i have never been so proud of a student at my school I don’t know her, but I love her " False link

The teacher’s rebuttal:  I just commented this on a transphobic post that was all like, “In a sexual species, females have two X chromosomes and males have an X and a Y, I’m not a bigot it’s just science.” I’m a science teacher so I responded with this. First of all, in a sexual species, you can have females be XX and males be X (insects), you can have females be ZW and males be ZZ (birds), you can have females be females because they developed in a warm environment and males be males because they developed in a cool environment (reptiles), you can have females be females because they lost a penis sword fighting contest (some flatworms), you can have males be males because they were born female, but changed sexes because the only male in their group died (parrotfish and clownfish), you can have males look and act like females because they are trying to get close enough to actual females to mate with them (cuttlefish, bluegills, others), or you can be one of thousands of sexes (slime mold, some mushrooms.) Oh, did you mean humans? Oh ok then. You can be male because you were born female, but you have 5-alphareductase deficiency and so you grew a penis at age 12. You can be female because you have an X and a Y chromosome but you are insensitive to androgens, and so you have a female body. You can be female because you have an X and a Y chromosome but your Y is missing the SRY gene, and so you have a female body. You can be male because you have two X chromosomes, but one of your X’s HAS an SRY gene, and so you have a male body. You can be male because you have two X chromosomes- but also a Y. You can be female because you have only one X chromosome at all. And you can be male because you have two X chromosomes, but your heart and brain are male. And vice - effing - versa. Don’t use science to justify your bigotry. The world is way too weird for that shit.   Addressing this to the TERF that assaulted me. " False link

About 70 members of Congress said they support the bill. The bill would classify conversion therapy and those practitioners who offer it as fraudulent. As you know, it’s been shown many times that conversion therapy does not work and is actually deeply harmful.  “The bill is very simple,” Lieu told The Washington Post. “It says it is fraud if you treat someone for a condition that doesn’t exist and there’s no medical condition known as being gay. LGBTQ people were born perfect; there is nothing to treat them for. And by calling this what it should be, which is fraud, it would effectively shut down most of the organizations.” The Washington Post article linked above provides a really good history of conversion therapy, from its earliest opponents to its documented harmful effects to the politicians who still won’t say whether or not they’d support a ban.

African leaders are seeking ways to feed their peoples and become players in the global economy. In the second edition of The New Harvest: Agricultural Innovation in Africa, I argue that Africa can feed itself in a generation. However, efforts to achieve such an ambitious goal continue to be frustrated by policies adopted by Africa’s historical trading partners, especially the European Union. There are at least three ways in which EU policies affect Africa’s ability to address its agricultural and food challenges: tariff escalation; technological innovation and food export preferences. African leaders would like to escape the colonial trap of being viewed simply as raw material exporters. But their efforts to add value to the materials continue to be frustrated by existing EU policies. Take the example of coffee. In 2014 Africa —the home of coffee— earned nearly $2.4 billion from the crop. Germany, a leading processor, earned about $3.8 billion from coffee re-exports. The concern is not that Germany benefits from processing coffee. It is that Africa is punished by EU tariff barriers for doing so. Non-decaffeinated green coffee is exempt from the charges. However, a 7.5 per cent charge is imposed on roasted coffee. As a result, the bulk of Africa’s export to the EU is unroasted green coffee. The charge on cocoa is even more debilitating. It is reported that the “EU charges (a tariff) of 30 per cent for processed cocoa products like chocolate bars or cocoa powder, and 60 per cent for some other refined products containing cocoa.” The impact of such charges goes well beyond lost export opportunities. They suppress technological innovation and industrial development among African countries. The practice denies the continent the ability to acquire, adopt and diffuse technologies used in food processing. It explains to some extent the low level of investment in Africa’s food processing enterprises.  @kawuli? Would you add anything? So in addition to the stuff on import tariffs the article goes into the issue of the EU essentially exporting extremely restrictive policies on GM crops. That part’s actually fascinating–there are publicly developed GM technologies to deal with disease in bananas in Uganda (where they’re a staple food, not just a tasty snack) and to control a very annoying moth pest in black-eyed pea (aka cowpea) in Nigeria. Both of these are potentially super useful!  This is the kind of thing that I’m talking about when I say “GM technology is fine, the problem is the application.” These are publicly developed technologies that could have wide-ranging benefits. I worked with black-eyed peas aka cowpea. Pest control is a HUGE issue. GM cowpea doesn’t fix the problem of needing better seed commercialization systems, and you’ll need different varieties for different conditions, which is why it’s important not to focus on GM to the exclusion of all this other important stuff. But still, potentially very helpful. These varieties–developed by public research institutes, not big corporate nonsense, remember –can’t be released, because of overly restrictive biosafety rules which are in many cases promoted by the EU and EU and North America based NGOs.  The one thing that this article doesn’t go into is dumping of exports from the EU into Africa. The one I’m most familiar with is powdered milk. The EU subsidizes the everloving hell out of agriculture, so EU-produced milk powder is super cheap. To the point where in Mali it is cheaper to buy imported powdered milk than to buy local milk. Which means that farmers who would like to get into dairy production can’t do so, because they can’t compete. Not because their costs are higher–they are definitely not–but because European milk powder is artificially cheap.   In regards to milk powder, the same thing happened in Jamaica when the IMF imposed trade policies flooding the market with artificially cheap milk powder.  Jamaica already had robust dairy production, but they were all put out of business by these imports.  The cows were sent to slaughter, the machinery sold off, the workers laid off and the dairy expertise lost.  When there’s a downturn in the Jamaican economy and they can no longer afford imports they just go without milk, since bringing dairy production back online is a long and costly process.  The same thing happened to other agricultural production.  Imported subsidized carrots and potatoes undercut Jamaican farmers and now much of their agricultural land goes uncultivated. and I think one of the most glaring examples of European complicity in starving Africa is the history of Thomas Sankara’s revolution in Burkina Faso.  In the span of four years the revolution achieved agricultural self-sufficiency in one of the poorest and most arid countries in the world.  Since Francois Mitterrand’s France and their neocolonial puppets in Cote d’Ivoire could not abide Sankara’s refusal to pay colonial era debts (at the expense of his desperately poor people) he was assassinated and Burkina Faso slid back into aid dependency and continued underdevelopment.  Much of American foreign aid and IMF development plans revolve around destroying a nation’s internal markets and reducing its tariffs so that their basic goods will have to be provided by an outside power that can produce them more cheaply, namely America and the EU, with their subsidized food. Theoretically, this is justified by the classical economist Ricardo’s theory of comparative advantage. Since third world nations have lots of labour, they should put it into doing labour intensive things well, like producing consumer goods for Western nations, not providing food for themselves. In practice, it ends up ensuring that if any government that comes to power in these countries defies America in any way, their internal market can’t provide the necessary amount of food to keep their own citizens well fed, and the nation faces either starvation or whatever punitive measures are put on. (the assassinations and coups usually come after a nation attempts a crash course in food self sufficiency anyways)  more ways that Europe and Usa continue to use Africa to subsidize their wealth  This reminded me of an article I read and saved.  “The European Union (EU), has urged Nigeria Government to increase export of agricultural produces like rubber, cocoa and palm oil to the EU countries. The Head of EU Delegation to Nigeria and ECOWAS, Mr Michel Arrion, stated this at a press conference on commemorate the 40 years of EU-Nigeria partnership on Wednesday, in Abuja. Arrion said there were potential exports, which Nigeria could develop in commercial quantities for export, lamenting that such exports to the EU were currently in low quantities.”  Here is most of the article    “Perhaps the call is coming as a result of the fear that Nigeria is looking more to Chinese technology and developing a higher trading relationship. The Union has every cause to worry because its traditional source of cheap raw material is being threatened by the growing trading relation between Nigeria and China.  All along and in the last forty years as it claims, the Union has not considered it necessary to set up local processing plants in Nigeria to process agricultural produce to either semi processed or finished products that could command higher value in their home countries. Even when Nigerian businesses struggle to set up such processing plants they are denied access to European market in the name of quality.  It is quite unfortunate that it is at this time that the present government is trying to refocus the economy that the EU is asking Nigeria to concentrate in producing and exporting primary commodity to Europe. In the opinion of the EU “There are potential exports like rubber for instance for tiles that Nigeria could certainly develop. We will be delighted to import and to buy more rubber from Nigeria; the problem is that the production is very small. We will be delighted to buy more cocoa from Nigeria. We are buying most of our cocoa from Ivory Coast and Ghana, while not from Nigeria?” he said.  Is the EU a true friend of Nigeria? Knowing that the current economic crisis the nation is facing arose from the collapse of commodity prices in the global market, the EU is still urging Nigeria to continue to export primary commodities to it without adding value to them.  The government must be wary of such advice and take the necessary measures to ensure that no commodity is exported from Nigeria without value addition in the near future. The current Federal government’s policy on agriculture should be comprehensive enough to embrace the entire value chain in each of the commodities it intends to develop fully. The European Union knows too well that in the last ten to fifteen years nearly half of the country agricultural produce are wasted as a result of lack of storage facilities and processing capability. It has not one day attempt to offer a solution.  In recent years farmers in the northern part of the country had suffered losses of tones of tomatoes as result of lack of processing facilities. In recent months thanks to brave Nigerian business men like Dangote and the rest that have to set up tomatoes processing plants to help arrest the continued influx of processed tomatoes that were being dumped into the Nigerian market.”  Read more at: vanguard     Reading what has been discussed so far shines the EU’s request for more exports of rubber, cocoa and palm oil in a different light… " False link

If that wasn’t already good enough news for you, one of the show’s characters is gender-neutral.   The students are racially diverse and include Hank, a piano-playing prodigy who uses a wheelchair and Riley, who is gender-neutral. “If pressed we’d say she’s a girl, but maybe not forever,” said Andrews’ daughter, Emma Walton Hamilton, who created the show with her mother. “We wanted to be diverse as possible.” Aside from the greenies the series will feature celebrity guest stars such as Tituss Burgess, Chris Colfer, Idina Menzel and Carol Burnett. “This project represents the fulfillment of a long held dream to educate children about the wonder of the arts,” Andrews said in a statement announcing the show.  I am here for this.  It has an episode where Spike, the black boy, is encouraged to write even though he insists that “no one” like him is a writer (the phrasing makes it very clear that it is a racial issue).  And then the next episode is about the boys learning that ballet isn’t just for girls, and Hank learns that he can still dance, even in the chair. Plus there’s music every episode and theater/exercise warm ups for kids! And all the puppets are by the Henson Company!  My favorite so far is Fizz!  She’s a precious girl who is never mocked for asking questions, is in fact encouraged to explore things.  Plus, their overarching plot is putting on a musical about an Ogre that takes away “all the arts”.  It’s a simply WONDERFUL series.

I rushed into the bedroom and watched my wife, Rachel, stumble from the bathroom, doubled over, hugging herself in pain. “Something’s wrong,” she gasped. This scared me. Rachel’s not the type to sound the alarm over every pinch or twinge. She cut her finger badly once, when we lived in Iowa City, and joked all the way to Mercy Hospital as the rag wrapped around the wound reddened with her blood. Once, hobbled by a training injury in the days before a marathon, she limped across the finish line anyway. So when I saw Rachel collapse on our bed, her hands grasping and ungrasping like an infant’s, I called the ambulance. I gave the dispatcher our address, then helped my wife to the bathroom to vomit. I don’t know how long it took for the ambulance to reach us that Wednesday morning. Pain and panic have a way of distorting time, ballooning it, then compressing it again. But when we heard the sirens wailing somewhere far away, my whole body flooded with relief. I didn’t know our wait was just beginning. I buzzed the EMTs into our apartment. We answered their questions: When did the pain start? That morning. Where was it on a scale of one to 10, with 10 being worst? “Eleven,” Rachel croaked. As we loaded into the ambulance, here’s what we didn’t know: Rachel had an ovarian cyst, a fairly common thing. But it had grown, undetected, until it was so large that it finally weighed her ovary down, twisting the fallopian tube like you’d wring out a sponge. This is called ovarian torsion, and it creates the kind of organ-failure pain few people experience and live to tell about. “Ovarian torsion represents a true surgical emergency,” says an article in the medical journal Case Reports in Emergency Medicine. “High clinical suspicion is important. … Ramifications include ovarian loss, intra-abdominal infection, sepsis, and even death.” The best chance of salvaging a torsed ovary is surgery within eight hours of when the pain starts. * * * There is nothing like witnessing a loved one in deadly agony. Your muscles swell with the blood they need to fight or run. I felt like I could bend iron, tear nylon, through the 10-minute ambulance ride and as we entered the windowless basement hallways of the hospital. And there we stopped. The intake line was long—a row of cots stretched down the darkened hall. Someone wheeled a gurney out for Rachel. Shaking, she got herself between the sheets, lay down, and officially became a patient. We didn’t know her ovary was dying, calling out in the starkest language the body has. Emergency-room patients are supposed to be immediately assessed and treated according to the urgency of their condition. Most hospitals use the Emergency Severity Index, a five-level system that categorizes patients on a scale from “resuscitate” (treat immediately) to “non-urgent” (treat within two to 24 hours). I knew which end of the spectrum we were on. Rachel was nearly crucified with pain, her arms gripping the metal rails blanched-knuckle tight. I flagged down the first nurse I could. “My wife,” I said. “I’ve never seen her like this. Something’s wrong, you have to see her.” “She’ll have to wait her turn,” she said. Other nurses’ reactions ranged from dismissive to condescending. “You’re just feeling a little pain, honey,” one of them told Rachel, all but patting her head. We didn’t know her ovary was dying, calling out in the starkest language the body has. I saw only the way Rachel’s whole face twisted with the pain.  Soon, I started to realize—in a kind of panic—that there was no system of triage in effect. The other patients in the line slept peacefully, or stared up at the ceiling, bored, or chatted with their loved ones. It seemed that arrival order, not symptom severity, would determine when we’d be seen. As we neared the ward’s open door, a nurse came to take Rachel’s blood pressure. By then, Rachel was writhing so uncontrollably that the nurse couldn’t get her reading. She sighed and put down her squeezebox. “You’ll have to sit still, or we’ll just have to start over,” she said. Finally, we pulled her bed inside. They strapped a plastic bracelet, like half a handcuff, around Rachel’s wrist. * * * From an early age we’re taught to observe basic social codes: Be polite. Ask nicely.Wait your turn. But during an emergency, established codes evaporate—this is why ambulances can run red lights and drive on the wrong side of the road. I found myself pleading, uselessly, for that kind of special treatment. I kept having the strange impulse to take out my phone and call 911, as if that might transport us back to an urgent, responsive world where emergencies exist. The average emergency-room patient in the U.S. waits 28 minutes before seeing a doctor. I later learned that at Brooklyn Hospital Center, where we were, the average wait was nearly three times as long, an hour and 49 minutes. Our wait would be much, much longer. Everyone we encountered worked to assure me this was not an emergency. “Stones,” one of the nurses had pronounced. That made sense. I could believe that. I knew that kidney stones caused agony but never death. She’d be fine, I convinced myself, if I could only get her something for the pain. By 10 a.m., Rachel’s cot had moved into the “red zone” of the E.R., a square room with maybe 30 beds pushed up against three walls. She hardly noticed when the attending physician came and visited her bed; I almost missed him, too. He never touched her body. He asked a few quick questions, and then left. His visit was so brief it didn’t register that he was the person overseeing Rachel’s care. Around 10:45, someone came with an inverted vial and began to strap a tourniquet around Rachel’s trembling arm. We didn’t know it, but the doctor had prescribed the standard pain-management treatment for patients with kidney stones: hydromorphone for the pain, followed by a CT scan. The pain medicine started seeping in. Rachel fell into a kind of shadow consciousness, awake but silent, her mouth frozen in an awful, anguished scowl. But for the first time that morning, she rested. * * * Leslie Jamison’s essay “Grand Unified Theory of Female Pain” examines ways that different forms of female suffering are minimized, mocked, coaxed into silence. In an interview included in her book The Empathy Exams, she discussed the piece, saying: “Months after I wrote that essay, one of my best friends had an experience where she was in a serious amount of pain that wasn’t taken seriously at the ER.” She was talking about Rachel.   “Women are likely to be treated less aggressively until they prove that they are as sick as male patients.” “That to me felt like this deeply personal and deeply upsetting embodiment of what was at stake,” she said. “Not just on the side of the medical establishment—where female pain might be perceived as constructed or exaggerated—but on the side of the woman herself: My friend has been reckoning in a sustained way about her own fears about coming across as melodramatic.” “Female pain might be perceived as constructed or exaggerated”: We saw this from the moment we entered the hospital, as the staff downplayed Rachel’s pain, even plain ignored it. In her essay, Jamison refers back to “The Girl Who Cried Pain,” a study identifying ways gender bias tends to play out in clinical pain management. Women are  “more likely to be treated less aggressively in their initial encounters with the health-care system until they ‘prove that they are as sick as male patients,’” the study concludes—a phenomenon referred to in the medical community as “Yentl Syndrome.” In the hospital, a lab tech made small talk, asked me how I like living in Brooklyn, while my wife struggled to hold still enough for the CT scan to take a clear shot of her abdomen. “Lot of patients to get to, honey,” we heard, again and again, when we begged for stronger painkillers. “Don’t cry.” I felt certain of this: The diagnosis of kidney stones—repeated by the nurses and confirmed by the attending physician’s prescribed course of treatment—was a denial of the specifically female nature of Rachel’s pain. A more careful examiner would have seen the need for gynecological evaluation; later, doctors told us that Rachel’s swollen ovary was likely palpable through the surface of her skin. But this particular ER, like many in the United States, had no attending OB-GYN. And every nurse’s shrug seemed to say, “Women cry—what can you do?” Nationwide, men wait an average of 49 minutes before receiving an analgesic for acute abdominal pain. Women wait an average of 65 minutes for the same thing. Rachel waited somewhere between 90 minutes and two hours. “My friend has been reckoning in a sustained way about her own fears about coming across as melodramatic.” Rachel does struggle with this, even now. How long is it appropriate to continue to process a traumatic event through language, through repeated retellings? Friends have heard the story, and still she finds herself searching for language to tell it again, again, as if the experience is a vast terrain that can never be fully circumscribed by words. Still, in the throes of debilitating pain, she tried to bite her lip, wait her turn, be good for the doctors. For hours, nothing happened. Around 3 o’clock, we got the CT scan and came back to the ER. Otherwise, Rachel lay there, half-asleep, suffering and silent. Later, she’d tell me that the hydromorphone didn’t really stop the pain—just numbed it slightly. Mostly, it made her feel sedated, too tired to fight. If she had been alone, with no one to agitate for her care, there’s no telling how long she might have waited. Eventually, the doctor—the man who’d come to Rachel’s bedside briefly, and just once—packed his briefcase and left. He’d been around the ER all day, mostly staring into a computer. We only found out later he’d been the one with the power to rescue or forget us. When a younger woman came on duty to take his place, I flagged her down. I told her we were waiting on the results of a CT scan, and I hassled her until she agreed to see if the results had come in. When she pulled up Rachel’s file, her eyes widened. “What is this mess?” she said. Her pupils flicked as she scanned the page, the screen reflected in her eyes. “Oh my god,” she murmured, as though I wasn’t standing there to hear. “He never did an exam.” The male doctor had prescribed the standard treatment for kidney stones—Dilauded for the pain, a CT scan to confirm the presence of the stones. In all the hours Rachel spent under his care, he’d never checked back after his initial visit. He was that sure. As far as he was concerned, his job was done. If Rachel had been alone, with no one to agitate for her care, there’s no telling how long she might have waited. It was almost another hour before we got the CT results. But when they came, they changed everything. “She has a large mass in her abdomen,” the female doctor said. “We don’t know what it is.” That’s when we lost it. Not just because our minds filled then with words liketumor and cancer and malignant. Not just because Rachel had gone half crazy with the waiting and the pain. It was because we’d asked to wait our turn all through the day—longer than a standard office shift—only to find out we’d been an emergency all along.  Suddenly, the world responded with the urgency we wanted. I helped a nurse push Rachel’s cot down a long hallway, and I ran beside her in a mad dash to make the ultrasound lab before it closed. It seemed impossible, but we were told that if we didn’t catch the tech before he left, Rachel’s care would have to be delayed until morning. “Whatever happens,” Rachel told me while the tech prepared the machine, “don’t let me stay here through the night. I won’t make it. I don’t care what they tell you—I know I won’t.” Soon, the tech was peering inside Rachel through a gray screen. I couldn’t see what he saw, so I watched his face. His features rearranged into a disbelieving grimace. By then, Rachel and I were grasping at straws. We thought: cancer. We thought: hysterectomy. Lying there in the dim light, Rachel almost seemed relieved. “I can live without my uterus,” she said, with a soft, weak smile. “They can take it out, and I’ll get by.” She’d make the tradeoff gladly, if it meant the pain would stop. After the ultrasound, we led the gurney—slowly, this time—down the long hall to the ER, which by then was  completely crammed with beds. Trying to find a spot for Rachel’s cot was like navigating rush-hour traffic. Then came more bad news. At 8 p.m., they had to clear the floor for rounds. Anyone who was not a nurse, or lying in a bed, had to leave the premises until visiting hours began again at 9. When they let me back in an hour later, I found Rachel alone in a side room of the ER. So much had happened. Another doctor had told her the mass was her ovary, she said. She had something called ovarian torsion—the fallopian-tube twists, cutting off blood. There was no saving it. They’d have to take it out. Rachel seemed confident and ready. “He’s a good doctor,” she said. “He couldn’t believe that they left me here all day. He knows how much it hurts.” When I met the surgery team, I saw Rachel was right. Talking with them, the words we’d used all day—excruciating, emergency, eleven—registered with real and urgent meaning. They wanted to help. By 10:30, everything was ready. Rachel and I said goodbye outside the surgery room, 14 and a half hours from when her pain had started. * * * Rachel’s physical scars are healing, and she can go on the long runs she loves, but she’s still grappling with the psychic toll—what she calls “the trauma of not being seen.” She has nightmares, some nights. I wake her up when her limbs start twitching. Sometimes we inspect the scars on her body together, looking at the way the pink, raised skin starts blending into ordinary flesh. Maybe one day, they’ll become invisible. Maybe they never will.  This made me SOOOO FUCKING ANGRY  children get ignored the same way, incidentally. when i was 12 i waited 4 hours in the emergency room with an impacted bowel. i was in so much pain that i bit through the corner of a paperback book. even with both my parents flagging down nurses and doctors multiple times to say “you don’t understand, this is not how he reacts to things, he has a really high pain tolerance, he laughed off a broken collarbone, he never cries,” all i got was scolded for making noise. that’s right, a 12-year-old child failed to contain his cries of agony, and the hospital staff snapped at him for it. when at last the x-ray happened, the tech made fun of me for clutching a comfort toy. the solution to my problem was an enema. i’d been retching up bile from the pain for hours; when they gave me the enema, i convulsed for the millionth time and basically exploded from both ends. the nurse overseeing this let me know how disgusted she was with me for making such a mess. when we took this story to my GP and she looked at the information, she told me my bowel could have ruptured at any time, and without treatment i would’ve lived no more than 24 hours, probably less than 12. 4 of which i spent waiting for someone to even try to help me. because ‘kids exaggerate’ and ‘teenagers play things up for attention’. abdominal pain has been a PTSD trigger for me ever since, and will be for the rest of my life. every time i get a stomachache, every time i get gas, every time i see someone on tv get gutshot or even punched in the stomach, there it is: the memory of torment so extreme that i physically couldn’t stop myself from screaming, while my mother wept and my father desperately tried to hold himself back from hulking out, and knowing that the people who could save me refused to try because they held me in such contempt.  Yeah.  Friend of mine fainted in class, multiple times, before anyone decided her anemia might be serious.  She had thyroid cancer.  Same friend: appendix RUPTURED,  because everyone, including her, thought it was period cramps until she was in the early stages of septic shock.Lower pelvic pain is seen as nfbd in people with certain anatomy.  We’re routinely expected to shrug it off, told it can’t be that bad, we endure it regularly, everyone feels that way.  I’ve seen fibroids bigger than your head.  Ovarian cysts that weighed more than an infant.  No big deal.  Right?We know so little about the uterus and ovaries and their effect on the human body, and yet we don’t want to study them.  *pissed OFF.*  I think Graham’s right when he said that a lot of the ignorance and misinformation around uterine healthcare is based off a desire to keep people with them disempowered.  Doctors gave me a decade of “ice and ibuprofen” noise for excruciating wrist and hand pain and numbness until i said the magic words “the pain is so bad it wakes me up at night” For some reason, that exact phrase opens doors. But you have to say it, not just describe it, or they will let your problem sort itself out until you do. Three excruciating nerve conduction tests didn’t open that door, but mentioning how it messed up my sleep (the least of my problems, i had thought) threw it right open. Do not be timid, they will send you away with the least help they can provide. Assume any doctor is deaf to anything short of certain rote declarations of suffering that have been trained to listen for and make them hear you.  I read that book of essays in college, and I still have it. Honestly, they’re so true to my own experience. I had some debilitating lower abdominal pain a while back, and when the nurse called with the ultrasound results istg she was practically laughing at me when she said “it’s just a little ovarian cyst, sweetie, everyone gets them and they usually go away on their own” like bitch?? If EVERYONE with ovaries goes through that maybe we should?? I dunno?? LOOK INTO A WAY TO PREVENT IT?? That level of pain is NOT normal, and it’s so disgusting to have people who are supposed to be medical professionals act like you’re playing it up for laughs. Like who do you think has to pay the medical bills?? Do you think I’d come into a US emergency room if I didn’t feel like I was dying??  A coworker of Howler’s had her pain ignored, no scans done, referred to PT. They didn’t catch her cancer until it had already metastasized. One scan, and they would have caught it in time to treat it. She is now dying because no one would take her pain seriously. " False link

The first one, was this: “What do you do after you’ve finished draft one and had beta readers review? Hire a professional editor? More beta readers?” This is a great question, and one that kind of ties into a big part of working a novel, namely, how do you know when you’re ready to submit? This answer, of course, is going to vary writer to writer. But generally, my process looks like this: Draft the book—first draft.  Take a break from the book.  Revise—second draft (which often requires many rounds of revisions). Send to first round of critique partners.  Revise with first round notes—third draft (which also often requires many rounds of revisions).  Send to second round of critique partners, plus sometimes first sensitivity readers. Revise with second round notes—fourth draft (which also (surprise!) often requires several rounds of revisions).  Send to sensitivity readers I haven’t already sent it to.  Revise with sensitivity readers notes—fifth draft.  Send to agent.  If I didn’t have an agent, step ten would be to start querying. Basically, that’s the point where I say, “okay, I’ve made this as good as I can for now—it’s time to get some industry opinions.” That’s the point where I believe I’ve taken all the steps I can to make my work as good as it’s going to get for now.  While I personally never hired a freelance editor to work on my manuscripts (mostly because, to be completely transparent, I couldn’t afford it), I am, as most of you know, a freelance editor. So I’m very well aware that many writers work with freelance editors before querying—which is cool! As an editor, I do everything I can to point out the problem areas and make suggestions to help my clients better prepare their manuscripts for submission. Very rarely have I worked with a client where I thought they were already pretty much ready to go (I can think of maybe two or three cases total, in nearly a year of freelancing)—so I do think it can be helpful to work with an editor before you submit, if that’s something you can afford. As a freelance editor, however, I always recommend working with critique partners and betas first, before you hire a freelance editor. There’s a ton you can learn from other writers—for free!—so that you get the basic stuff out of the way before you work with a professional. So if I were to work with a freelance editor, I’d personally make that my Step 10, before I sent the manuscript off to query. Ultimately, here’s what you want to make sure you cover before you start querying: Have I made my work the best I can reasonably make it at this time?  Have I worked with others to make sure I’ve fixed problems I couldn’t catch on my own?  If representing a (or many!) marginalized group(s), have I worked with sensitivity readers and taken their notes into account to make sure I’ve respectfully and accurately portrayed that marginalization to the best of my ability?  The steps you take—and how many steps you take, and in what order—are going to vary both on your manuscript and your own process. I now take many more steps that I did years ago when I first started out—and it’s not a coincidence that my work has improved markedly since then. But what’s important is you’re honest with yourself about whether you’ve really done enough to get your manuscript ready—and when you reach that point, you take a deep breath, and let your work fly. What steps do you take to make your manuscript query-ready? " False link

The Russian newspaper says it confirmed the news with government officials and an analyst of the region also confirmed the news to the Times with her own sources. Three men are known to have been murdered, although the real number is likely to be higher.  in almost every genocide, the first “act” is the rounding up and killing of a group of men, specifically.  In “root and branch” genocides they [”civilian men of ‘battle age’”] are often the first group to be separated out and massacred, paving the way for the murder of women, children, and elderly men. In more common articulations of genocide, however, they can be the only group slated for outright massacre, while women, children, and elderly men suffer a range of alternative fates involving rape, sexual exploitation, torture, forced maternity, murder, and expulsion. Gender and the Future of Genocide Studies and Prevention   as the rest of this article explains this isn’t to say that men have it worst in a genocide, but that it’s important when you see a very common red flag for genocide to pay attention to the “conflict” in case any more markers of an impending genocide occur.  the g word is really loaded and i’m not bringing this up because i want to start an avalanche of “CHECHNYA IS COMMITTING GENOCIDE AGAINST GAY PEOPLE” fear mongering (that is the absolute last thing that i want). it’s just not possible to prevent any genocide without questioning whether a current conflict might eventually get there. and i do not think it’s nothing that genocide watch is reporting on this.  UPDATE 4/10/17 Chechnya has opened concentration camps for gay men   Gay men arrested in a ‘purge’ in the Russian region of Chechnya are being held in concentration camp-style prisons, reports have alleged. Early reports emerged earlier this month that gay people are being targeted in the region, which is part of Russia but has substantial autonomy. Russian newspapers and human rights groups report that more than 100 gay men have been detained “in connection with their non-traditional sexual orientation, or suspicion of such” as part of a purge. Several people were also reportedly feared dead following violent raids. In a chilling response, a Chechen government spokesperson denied that there are any gay people to detain, insisting that “you can’t detain and harass someone who doesn’t exist in the republic”. The Kremlin denied any knowledge of a purge. But reports have since emerged that the men arrested are being kept in horrific concentration camp prisons, where violent abuse and torture is common. Based on interviews with eyewitnesses and survivors, Novaya Gazeta reports that a secret prison has been set up in the town of Argun to detain the men arrested in the purge. One man who was released from the camp told the newspaper that he was subjected to violent “interrogations” at the camp, as Chechen officials attempted to get him to confess the names and locations of more gay men. The officials also seized his mobile phone, targeting his network of contacts regardless of whether they were gay or not. The camp was reportedly set up by Chechen forces in a former military headquarters in the town. The newspaper reports allegations that the Speaker of the Parliament of Chechnya was among officials to visit the site, though the claims have not been substantiated. The detainees face electric shock torture and violent beatings, while some of them have been held to ransom and used to extort their families. Tanya Lokshina of Human Rights Watch wrote: “For several weeks now, a brutal campaign against LGBT people has been sweeping through Chechnya. She continued: “Law enforcement and security agency officials under control of the ruthless head of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, have rounded up dozens of men on suspicion of being gay, torturing and humiliating the victims. “Some of the men have forcibly disappeared. Others were returned to their families barely alive from beatings. At least three men apparently have died since this brutal campaign began.” She added: “These days, very few people in Chechnya dare speak to human rights monitors or journalists even anonymously because the climate of fear is overwhelming and people have been largely intimidated into silence. “Filing an official complaint against local security officials is extremely dangerous, as retaliation by local authorities is practically inevitable. “It is difficult to overstate just how vulnerable LGBT people are in Chechnya, where homophobia is intense and rampant. “LGBT people are in danger not only of persecution by the authorities but also of falling victim to ‘honour killings’ by their own relatives for tarnishing family honour.” What Can We Do?   Alexander Artmyev from Amnesty International spoke to Metro.co.uk. He said that people who are not in Russia can help by joining the charity’s Urgent Action on Chechnya. The action encourages people to write in Russian or your own language to Chairman of the Investigation Committee and Acting Head of the Investigation Committee for the Chechen Republic. Amnesty has also asked the letter, which should ask for an investigation and appeal for protection for LGBT individuals, to be copied into Human Rights groups and diplomatic missions from your country.

On Wednesday, the massive adult entertainment destination took the  somewhat surprising step of launching the “Pornhub Sexual Health  Center.”  They’re hoping the free sub-site  will become a go-to resource for some of their 70 million daily users  on all manner of topics, including STIs, sexual safety and how to manage  relationships. They’ve chosen Dr. Laurie Betito, a renowned sex therapist, to direct  the site and they’ll also be working with a number of doctors,  therapists and other experts to offer advice and answer questions.  Corey  Price, Pornhub’s Vice President, told Mashable, “Our goal is  to provide our visitors with a site that has credible and insightful  information, rather than have them scouring the internet.” While it’s a database they’ll build up over time, a first look  reveals they’ve started with the fundamentals — with answers to things  like “Babies. Where do they come from?” and “Are there really three  holes?”  These might seems almost laughably basic to adult consumers of  hardcore porn, but there are a lot of young people for whom these are  very real questions.  Price told Mashable they weren’t aiming the content  specifically at beginners.  He said they simply want to appeal to “those  who are looking for trustworthy sex tips and health advice provided by  experts.”  But it seems like they realize this could prove to be an  especially valuable resource for their younger audience, who most likely  isn’t getting comprehensive (much less sex-positive) sex ed in schools. There are, of course, plenty of online sexual health and education  resources, but for many kids, landing on sites like Pornhub is already  their way into learning about sex.  Porn can obviously teach you plenty  about the basics and mechanics of intercourse, but there’s a whole range  of other things — biology, health, consent, relating to intimate  partners, just to name a few — that you won’t pick up from watching  videos like “Big tits round asses” or “Sloppy throat games.”  So if they can slide their curious audience over to the PSHC while  they’re already on the site, it could function as pretty useful one-stop  shop for filling in the blanks left by spotty sex ed classes and the  birds and bees talks given by often bewildered parents.   Neat!  Holy shit their section on trans people was actually really good and not what I expected from something hosted by a porn site! If they had a containing various sexualities and whatnot as well, they’ll definitely have a good resource on their hands!  when a god damn porn site has better information about trans health than most school systems  " False link
