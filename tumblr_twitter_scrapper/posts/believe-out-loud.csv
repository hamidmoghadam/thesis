We send our prayers out to our trans community and their allies.  equalitymi:  Statewide LGBT Anti-Violence and Advocacy Organizations Urges LGBT People to Be Extra Cautious in Palmer Park Area DETROIT – Detroit Police are investigating three possibly related violent crimes near Palmer Park, located along Woodward Avenue between 6 and 7 Mile in Detroit.  At least two of the victims are transgender women, and one victim, whose gender identity is not yet public, was killed in Palmer Park last Friday. In that case, it is believed the victim may have been killer’s partner, and that after the murder took place, the perpetrator drove off, crashed into another car and ran away on foot, but a gun was left behind. The shooting on Sunday and another last week were not fatal, but the victims were transgender. No one is in custody but police say they have a person of interest. Equality Michigan, the statewide anti-violence and advocacy organization serving Michigan’s lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and HIV communities, supports victims of anti-transgender crime and tracks violence against transgender people throughout Michigan. The group has been helping law enforcement officials investigate the cases. Statement by Yvonne SiferdDirector of Victim Services, Equality Michigan “We are saddened to hear of the targeting of transgender people yet again in Michigan and that yet another life has ended too soon. We urge anyone with information about these shootings to contact the Detroit Police at 313-596-2260 or if you have information that you would like to report anonymously call Equality Michigan at 313-537-7000. We unequivocally offer our support to the victims and their families, and stand with our trans sisters who experience violence at disproportionate and alarming rates. We hope that those responsible are swiftly apprehended and brought to justice.” “Transgender women are far too often victims of the most severe violence. Our most recent report through the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs, Hate Violence Against Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and HIV-Affected Communities in the United States in 2013,consistent with previous trends noted, the vast majority of anti-transgender incidents reported were committed against transgender women. Transgender women are twice as likely to experience discrimination, 1.8 times more likely to experience harassment, and 1.5 times more likely to experience threats and intimidation compared to overall survivors. Equality Michigan and the NCAVP denounce violence and seek to raise awareness of the violence faced far too often by LGBT people in Michigan and especially people in the transgender communities. We encourage members of the LGBT community to be extra cautious around Palmer Park until the those responsible are caught.” ### Equality Michigan has worked passionately for over 20 years to achieve full equality and respect for all people in Michigan regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.

Kittredge Cherry compiles information on the “queer side” of St. Francis:  When Francis (1181-1226) was a young man, he had an unnamed male companion whom he dearly loved – and who was written out of history after the first biography. Other Franciscan friars referred to Francis as “Mother” during his lifetime. He encouraged his friars to be mothers to each other when in hermitage together, and used other gender-bending metaphors to describe the spiritual life. He experienced a vision of an all-female Trinity, who in turn saluted him as “Lady Poverty,” a title that he welcomed.   In another article on Jesus In Love, Franciscan scholar Kevin Elphick reveals new information about St. Francis’ earliest companion, who he believes to be Brother Elias of Cortona.  Image Credit: “They Shelter in a Cave” by José Benlliure y Gil (1926), via Jesus In Love Blog" True text
