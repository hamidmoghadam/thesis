That it would not destroy the American economy completely.  I’d quit my job also for $1k/mo.  Two roomies on $2k/mo can live reasonably well, especially when you consider that major work related expenses would be gone.  A family of 4 would make $48k/year tax free. To do nothing. @fandomsandfeminism thinks it should be $4k/mo.  A family of 4 would clear $192k/year tax free TO DO NOTHING. This is who fucking stupid people on the left are. SHE CLAIMS THIS IS THE MINIMUM NEEDED TO SURVIVE.  This is why she blocked me. She knows how fucking greedy and insane she is.  Who would anyone ever work?  In order to pay something along the lines of $12/trillion a year to all americans there would be a tax rate of 80%. ON TOP OF EXISTING TAXES.  Let’s pretend its just 80%. You would have to get paid $240k/year to make $48k after taxes.  No one would work jobs like burger flippers and sewage for $0 additional money. If you made $10/hr to do nothing would you work a 40 hour grueling job to make make $15/hr? So burger flippers would have to get paid in the area of $480k a year to justify even working compared to doing nothing make doing nothing.  They think all of this could be done without inflation.    This is how fucking stupid the left is.   Someone tag @fandomsandfeminism   She needs a math lesson.     @fandomsandfeminism ^thoughts Lazy people admitting that they would be lazy.  Like, you would actually stop working if you didn’t have the threat of starvation hanging over you?

Like, for example, graduating from high school, or nursing babies. The other thing this person misses: Robots can flip burgers. Robots can make reasonably decent burritos. It won’t be long before taxi drivers can be replaced by self driving cars. How are people going to survive if there are no jobs to be had. If your answer is: They don’t then you are supporting the end of our civilization, because once unemployment hits a certain level and hunger hits a certain level, then a violent revolution becomes pretty damn inevitable. Also, when calculating how to pay for UBI, then consider this: 1. The money saved by not having to decide who is eligible for welfare (disability is a slightly different matter, because disabled people have higher living costs and may require some system of grants/allowances). UBI would replace unemployment benefits, WIC, SNAP, etc. 2. The studies done on UBI demonstrate that health care costs drop, primarily due to reductions in drug/alcohol abuse, domestic violence, mental health costs in general and road traffic accidents (apparently people who aren’t worried about their survival drive more safely). SOME people are going to be lazy. Some people are always going to be lazy. Most people want to be doing something productive with their lives. (Now, I can’t actually support myself and my husband on 2k/month because of the CoL here. I would need something like 4k, because 2k is typical rent for a one bedroom in this area. I’m lucky mine’s a bit cheaper. Any basic income amount would have to be locally determined and flexible over time). Oh, and UBI is not a communist concept. " False text

We’ll focus on making her more sympathetic and less crazy. We’ll show she has a deep, real, and profound connection to the earth. We’ll show that she is struggling to maintain her humanity in light of a darkening situation and that she still feels compassion for human life, as it is also part of the earth. She will only apathetically kill people who are 100% irredeemable. She will have many moments in which she spares human life. She will have many complicated relationships with other women in the Universe, including Batgirl, Catwoman, Harley Quinn, Wonder Woman, Black Canary, the Birds of Prey, and many others. These relationships will range from uneasy trust or anger to understanding and love. She will not show romantic interest in men and will not be a sexually driven character. She will be a member of many hero teams, including the Birds of Prey and the Justice League, even if there are missteps in the writing of the character. Most of the Bat-family will recognize Ivy as a grey-area case that must be handled on an individual basis and will acknowledge that her situation is centered around tragedy and loss of self. They will recognize that Ivy could very well be the thing the saves the entire planet. They will recognize that Arkham is making her worse, and will do what they can to reason with her.  Wonder Woman will acknowledge that the Green and Mother Gaia chose Ivy as her protector and that she was wise to do so. (Sensation Comics #31) Batgirl will show numerous moments of concern and understanding and will even acknowledge that if they were in another world, their relationship would be very different. She will value Ivy’s powers as a source of good and believes Ivy’s struggle stems from the flawed nature of humanity. (Batgirl Annual #2, various) Batman will return to Ivy to ask her for help, knowing that when the world is at stake, she is a trustworthy ally to the Earth. (Swamp Thing) (Sensation Comics) (Detective Comics, various) (Justice League United) (Animal Man) There will be many moments where the relationship between the part of Ivy that is still human and the part that is the Green struggle to cooperate or have complexities in their natures. (Cycle of Life and Death) (No Man’s Land) (Birds of Prey) Harley Quinn will express implicit love for Ivy and in certain series, they will be in a canon loving relationship. This will not be subtext as it has been in the past. We will show an actual relationship between two women that isn’t just for eyecandy. (Harley Quinn series) (Bombshells) Yes, there will be missteps in the canon as many different hands are working between many different series, but overall the character will have undergone a complete transformation that far exceeds the previous incarnations.

Doctor finds anecdotal evidence that people are passing kidney stones after riding on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad at Disney World 2. Doctor makes 3-D model of kidney, complete with stones and urine (his own), takes it on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad 60 times 3. “The stones passed 63.89 percent of the time while the kidneys were in the back of the car. When they were in the front, the passage rate was only 16.67 percent. That’s based on only 60 rides on a single coaster, and Wartinger guards his excitement in the journal article: ‘Preliminary study findings support the anecdotal evidence that a ride on a moderate-intensity roller coaster could benefit some patients with small kidney stones.’” 4. “Some rides are going to be more advantageous for some patients than other rides. So I wouldn’t say that the only ride that helps you pass stones is Big Thunder Mountain. That’s grossly inaccurate.” 5. “His advice for now: If you know you have a stone that’s smaller than five millimeters, riding a series of roller coasters could help you pass that stone before it gets to an obstructive size and either causes debilitating colic or requires a $10,000 procedure to try and break it up. And even once a stone is broken up using shock waves, tiny fragments and “dust” remain that need to be passed. The coaster could help with that, too.” SCIENCE: IT WORKS  Update:  “In all, we used 174 kidney stones of varying shapes, sizes and weights to see if each model worked on the same ride and on two other roller coasters,” Wartinger said. “Big Thunder Mountain was the only one that worked. We tried Space Mountain and Aerosmith’s Rock ‘n’ Roller Coaster and both failed.”Wartinger went on to explain that these other rides are too fast and too violent with a G-force that pins the stone into the kidney and doesn’t allow it to pass.“The ideal coaster is rough and quick with some twists and turns, but no upside down or inverted movements,” he said.

Motorists are urged to seek alternative routes until further notice, DeKalb police said. To continue westbound on I-20, motorists must leave the highway at Flat Shoals Road, Exit 63, and travel on Cook Road to re-enter the interstate. Witness Greg Phillips saw a motorcyclist, who he said was going about 55 mph, crash when it happened. “(The motorcycle) just fell in,” Phillips said. “It was like a dip.” No cars hit the man who fell from his bike. The bike landed about 50 yards away.  JUST IN: Motorcyclist driving on I-20 as road buckled was flung into air and is in critical condition, police say https://t.co/kaAbgkT4o7 pic.twitter.com/4E0fyXww5v— WSB-TV (@wsbtv) April 17, 2017  “That’s a heck of a place in the road for this to happen,” Phillips said. “More work for the DOT.” GDOT crews were headed to the scene for repairs about 12:15 p.m. Phillips said more than 10 people rushed to help the man who fell from the motorcycle. Some of the people said they worked at Grady Memorial Hospital. The biker had multiple fractures and his leg was likely broken, paramedic Dennis Pierre Charles said. As he tried to help, Charles said he watched the bump in the road grow.  “The roadway just started getting higher and higher,” Charles said. “I’m not sure if something shifted underneath.”    The Atlanta highway grid system just can’t catch a break. First I-85, now I-20.     Now explain why we need a wall when the highways are crumbling.  Double whammy, Pipeline and Highway.  Or, as Bill Nigut of GPB put it today, “…the city is one traffic incident - or one good rainstorm - away from total collapse.”He was not exaggerating. Re the gas - the  pipeline is one of those urban ones for natural gas (NG). Atlanta Gas Light was drilling it and fouled up. No NG released, and no actual gas leak.  We really need the extra urban NG capacity too, here in ATL, otherwise existing pipes (which wear out and already need to be replaced), break, cause leaks, and do massive environmental harm, to say nothing of potentially causing explosions. And the first collapse (I-85), may have been a result of our chronic homeless problem in the US. Allegedly, a homeless man set the fire by lighting up a discarded couch, and the fire spread to the stored construction materials. Try to increase pipeline capacity, collapse highway.  Don’t try to solve homelessness, collapse highway.  Takeaway: fixing infrastructure is an intersectional problem, and may have negative externalities.

The teacher’s rebuttal:  I just commented this on a transphobic post that was all like, “In a sexual species, females have two X chromosomes and males have an X and a Y, I’m not a bigot it’s just science.” I’m a science teacher so I responded with this. First of all, in a sexual species, you can have females be XX and males be X (insects), you can have females be ZW and males be ZZ (birds), you can have females be females because they developed in a warm environment and males be males because they developed in a cool environment (reptiles), you can have females be females because they lost a penis sword fighting contest (some flatworms), you can have males be males because they were born female, but changed sexes because the only male in their group died (parrotfish and clownfish), you can have males look and act like females because they are trying to get close enough to actual females to mate with them (cuttlefish, bluegills, others), or you can be one of thousands of sexes (slime mold, some mushrooms.) Oh, did you mean humans? Oh ok then. You can be male because you were born female, but you have 5-alphareductase deficiency and so you grew a penis at age 12. You can be female because you have an X and a Y chromosome but you are insensitive to androgens, and so you have a female body. You can be female because you have an X and a Y chromosome but your Y is missing the SRY gene, and so you have a female body. You can be male because you have two X chromosomes, but one of your X’s HAS an SRY gene, and so you have a male body. You can be male because you have two X chromosomes- but also a Y. You can be female because you have only one X chromosome at all. And you can be male because you have two X chromosomes, but your heart and brain are male. And vice - effing - versa. Don’t use science to justify your bigotry. The world is way too weird for that shit.   Addressing this to the TERF that assaulted me. " False link
