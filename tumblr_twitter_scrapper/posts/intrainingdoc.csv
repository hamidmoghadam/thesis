But when it gets nasty, it gets really nasty.  I started my rotation in the ED last week, and my second patient was a 4 week old with a finger fracture.  Read that again.  FOUR weeks old. Meaning that he can’t roll over, can’t crawl,  can only see about a foot in front of his face and can’t lift his head. So that fact that he reportedly just “woke up like that” sketched us all out. So we got a skeletal survey, which is a series of x-rays of every bone in the body that we get on babies when we’re concerned that they’re being abused. And the results made me literally gasp out loud and feel like I was going to vomit. 12 fractures. 9 posterior rib fractures, which happen when adult hands squeeze a baby so hard that it breaks them. Two leg fractures, which happen when an adult picks a baby up and swings them by their leg. And then the finger, which I don’t even want to imagine.   It was then my job to go tell the parents what we had found and what was going to happen now. I took care of all of my other patients first and fiddled around on my computer for a few minutes. When I finally couldn’t put it off anymore, I walked towards their room, shaking so badly I wasn’t sure my voice would work. I was so afraid of what their reactions would be. Would they scream at me? Be physically violent? Take the baby and run (it happened to another resident earlier this month!)?  ""The x-rays came back and we found multiple rib fractures and two leg fractures. They are already healed and are older than the finger injury. At this point, we are required to contact CPS and admit him to the hospital to make sure that he will be safe at home before he can leave.”  The mom was shocked beyond words and wanted to know how this could have happened. I thought “You tell me and we’ll both know,” but said “I can’t tell you how the fractures happened, I can just tell you that they’re there.” The dad had his face in his hands and… didn’t seem too surprised. I’ll never know the whole story.  When we were in med school and all deciding which field to go into, people would often say, “I can’t go into Peds because seeing kids get sick with cancer is too sad.” I disagree. Our cancer patients are some of the strongest and pure-souled people on the planet. I am so honored to get to walk along side them on their journeys, and getting to know them is one of the best parts of my job. But child abuse sucks. It keeps us up at night and makes us lock ourselves in the bathroom at the hospital to cry. It puts fire in the eyes of even the sweetest and gentlest pediatric nurses and doctors. It’s what I hate the most about my job. Child abuse is one of, if not THE, worst thing that could ever happen to a child, and is 100% preventable. There are no excuses for hurting a child and there are no excuses for turning a blind eye when you see it. Everyone who works with children has to be on high alert and always trust their instincts. If you want to learn more, check out: https://www.cdc.gov/features/healthychildren/ and https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/preventing/preventionmonth/   This is so true. Cancer isn’t the saddest part of pediatrics. It’s what adults do to children that is the worst and the saddest part.Thank you to everyone in peds for doing what you do.  " False text

For 4 years, we cram everything into our heads, a little about every specialty. In the end, we all just can’t wait to specialize in our own fields and not have to remember the majority of other stuff we memorized. We can always just consult someone else if we need help right? Well… What if you didn’t recognize the underlying problem in the first place? This week on neurology, we had a 27 year old woman who was admitted overnight for severe headache. They ended up doing a brain MRI, which showed several small diffusion weighted defects in the posterior brain consistent with strokes. We were asked to see her in the morning for evaluation of “strokes”. I was asked to read her chart and go see her. I thought it was a little odd that a healthy 27 year old had strokes, but you never know. I start reading up and see that her systolic blood pressure has been above 160 all night. They were allowing some degree of permissive hypertension for her strokes. Her creatinine was 1.4. They also assumed this was because of her elevated blood pressures. Finally, there was protein in her urine. I keep reading and notice she is 4 days postpartum. I haven’t even seen the patient yet and put the pieces together in my head. Elevated blood pressure, severe headache with visual scotomas, elevated creatinine, protein in the urine, postpartum… Holy shit, this person has preeclampsia with severe features and needs to be started on a magnesium drip immediately! I want to go into Ob/Gyn, so naturally I was a little excited that I recognized this. I immediately went to my 70 year old attending and told him this. He looked surprised, and I could tell he probably hadn’t thought about this disease in decades since usually they are admitted to ob/gyn and not neurology. He asked me to call the ob/gyn that was on. Within a few hours, she was seen and started on a magnesium drip for preeclampsia with severe features. My attending and I went to radiology and had them re-read the scan. She had PRES not strokes. This woman could have gone home on aspirin, an anti-hypertensive, and a statin with neurology follow-up and had a seizure a day later from full blown eclampsia. In the end, I learned about how one person going down the rabbit hole of one diagnosis can lead to a series of several providers going down it as well. It was a shining moment for me as a medical student, not going to lie. But it also showed me the importance of being well read and not shutting out my mind to other specialties. We all need to know a little about everything and when to realize our limits and consult someone else. And a lot of the time, medical school is the only immersive experience we will get in many of these specialties. It matters more than just learning for the sake of the shelves. " False text

They discovered that regional  cerebral blood flow is reduced in the Broca’s area – the region in the  frontal lobe of the brain linked to speech production – in persons who  stutter. More severe stuttering is associated with even greater  reductions in blood flow to this region.  (Image caption:  Broca’s area, located in the frontal lobe of brain, plays a key role  in expressive speech. Blue regions represent areas of decreased blood  flow in children and adults with stuttering when compared to fluent  healthy participants. The red areas represent relatively higher blood  flow) In addition, a greater abnormality of cerebral blood flow in the  posterior language loop, associated with processing words that we hear,  correlates with more severe stuttering. This finding suggests that a  common pathophysiology throughout the neural “language” loop that  connects the frontal and posterior temporal lobe likely contributes to  stuttering severity. Peterson, who is director of the Institute for the Developing Mind at  CHLA and a professor of the Keck School of Medicine at the University  of Southern California, says that such a study of resting blood flow, or  perfusion, has never before been conducted in persons who stutter. His  team also recently published a study using proton magnetic resonance  spectroscopy to look at brain regions in both adults and children who  stutter. Those findings demonstrated links between stuttering and  changes in the brain circuits that control speech production, as well as  those supporting attention and emotion. The present blood flow study  adds significantly to the findings from that prior study and furthermore  suggests that disturbances in the speech processing areas of the brain  are likely of central importance as a cause of stuttering. According to Peterson, the new study – published on December 30 in the journal Human Brain Mapping  – provides scientists with a completely different window into the  brain. The researchers were able to zero in on the Broca’s area as well  as related brain circuitry specifically linked to speech, using regional  cerebral blood flow as a measure of brain activity, since blood flow is  typically coupled with neural activity. “When other portions of the brain circuit related to speech were also  affected according to our blood flow measurements, we saw more severe  stuttering in both children and adults,” said first author Jay Desai,  MD, a clinical neurologist at CHLA. “Blood flow was inversely correlated  to the degree of stuttering – the more severe the stuttering, the less  blood flow to this part of the brain,” said Desai, adding that the study  results were “quite striking.” " False text

However, researchers at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine found that a large portion of female patients with this eating disorder first develop one symptom of starvation at a normal BMI. The study was published in the International Journal of Eating Disorders.  “A person’s current BMI alone may not capture the impact of weight loss on psychological symptoms in those battling an eating disorder,” said Laura Berner, PhD, lead author and fellow at the UC San Diego Eating Disorders Center for Research and Treatment.  The study found that approximately 63 percent of patients first experienced amenorrhea, the absence of menstruation, in the mild AN severity category and more than one-third reported amenorrhea at an objectively normal BMI (at or above 18.5 kg).  “Menstrual function is an indicator of starvation and physical health. Our results add to a growing body of research suggesting that patients may show signs of starvation and severe psychological symptoms before an objectively low weight is reached,” said Berner.  Signs of starvation can also include diminished vertebral strength, abnormally slow heart rate, dizziness due to unstable blood pressure, high levels of concern about body shape and weight and extreme attempts to restrict dietary intake. The study findings have implications for both early detection and intervention for AN.  “All of the women in our sample were at an objectively low weight and were receiving an intensive level of treatment for their eating disorder. However, more than a third of these patients first showed a sign of starvation at a weight that might not have alarmed most health care providers,” said Berner. “The results highlight the importance of clinician assessment of weight history, not just current weight, and awareness of serious symptoms that may appear at a normal weight and could predict severe anorexia nervosa later.”  " False text

We all know that it is expensive, but when I say “expensive,” I actually mean “entirely unfeasible for many Americans.” I didn’t really understand either until I went from being a healthy kid to being in the PICU overnight, only to leave with hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical debt before my 17th birthday (and I was fortunate enough to have insurance!). I cannot begin to describe the impact this has had on my life. I’m saying this because there’s a lot of insensitivity going around about sick people who can’t afford care… about how they are just “lazy” and want a handout, or how if they’d just get a job, they might be able to pay their medical bills without destroying their lives. Frankly, it’s bullshit. In a system like ours where care is SO outrageous, and where health insurance is a necessity to make these costs even remotely feasible, it’s not just a simple personal failing due to laziness when someone can’t afford care. Particularly in light of what is going on with the ACA, there are going to be a lot of people voicing their very cruel and frankly incorrect opinion that people who can’t afford healthcare are just lazy mooches who don’t want to get a job. A little bit of sensitivity for such a complex issue would be nice. While there’s plenty that needs to be criticized and targeted about US healthcare, the patients struggling to get life-saving treatments aren’t it, and doing so just diverts attention away from the fact that US “medicine” has become a joke. And I’m saying this as someone in the thick of it, as both a chronically ill patient and a student doctor. " False text

Sanford Guide to Antimicrobial Therapy A great deal of emergency department patients are discharged or admitted on antibiotic therapy.

It details residency life in the 1970s. You can talk about this book with almost any medical student or attending. It is practically a medical school requirement.  Intern: A Doctor’s Initiation by Sandeep Jauhar A more modern look into medicine residency intern year from the perspective of Cardiologist Dr. Sandeep Jauhar. Comes with the highs and lows you can expect. After having been through 6 months of residency, I would say it is very accurate. Gifted Hands: The Ben Carson Story by Ben Carson. Just because I find Ben Carson incompetent as a politician does not mean I do not respect him as a doctor. He is a phenomenal pediatric neurosurgeon and this book details his story. On Doctoring: Stories, Poems, Essays by Richard Reynolds A book of stories and poems from doctors throughout time and also from famous poets and authors depicting their views of medicine. Private Practice: In the Early Twentieth-Century Medical Office of Dr. Richard Cabot by Christopher Crenner An interesting look into a Boston medicine clinic from the early 1900′s. With excerpts from old patient notes which I found very interesting.  And if you have an interest is something more dark: Blind Eye by James B. Stewart The real story of a doctor murderer from the 1990′s who killed multiple patients without getting caught for several years. Devil in the White City by Erik Larson  The story of the World’s Fair in Chicago in the late 1800′s. A great look into the history of Chicago and the murderous doctor who roamed its streets. And lastly: The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams. Just a great book in general. My favorite. Suggested by other users: The Making of a Woman Surgeon by Dr. Elizabeth Morgan Suggested by http://thetay-in-the-757.tumblr.com This book is my all time favorite, as I am a female aspiring to work in the healthcare system myself. Dr. Morgan chronicles her own journey in the male-dominated arena of medicine in the 1970s and 1980s, as she struggles to maintain an appropriate balance between remaining empathetic towards her patients and yet must toe the line of not becoming too emotionally involved with her patients so that she burns out, as well as maintaining her own femininity in a man’s world. When Breath Become Air by Dr. Paul Kalanithi Suggested by http://nandemokandemo.tumblr.com When Breath Becomes Air is an autobiography written by an esteemed neurosurgeon who discovers he has Stage IV lung cancer in his final stages of residency. It appeals to not only medical students, with his profound impressions of cadaver dissection and his first life and deaths, but also to current medical professionals by questioning philosophical domains of mortality and what a meaningful life is, as well as to non-medical professionals with moving thoughts on family, life, death and meaning. It is not a novel to be missed by any person.   " False text

Personalization of medicine on the social and psychological level is important to understanding the patient’s disease and choice of treatment. Furthermore, this approach guides diagnoses and may improve efficiency and accuracy. As the medical community absorbs technological advancements and applies them to patients, we find day after day that these advancements are still deficient if the patient is seen as a list of numbers and lab results. Once we know that patients are much more than a mathematical puzzle to be solved, and that illness is socially, psychologically and biologically intertwined, we will have truly taken the next step in medical advancement.” Samer Bou Karroum at American University of Beirut reflects on how the show “House” predicts the future of medicine."
