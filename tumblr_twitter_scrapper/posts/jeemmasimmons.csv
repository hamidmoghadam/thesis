No, listen. They are scientists, first and foremost, which means RESEARCH. Lots and lots of research. Do you think Simmons “I have two PhDs” and Fitz “I’m a rocket scientist” aren’t going to research the shit out of sex? They’ll start with the Karma Sutra and just go, full steam ahead, from there. Not to mention the fact that Fitz and Simmons are so in-tune with each other that they can read each other’s responses. And they are a couple that COMMUNICATES. And they’re a couple who likes to one-up each other. They’re competitive. You know what that means? Orgasm competitions. That’s all I’m saying. Fitz and Simmons have sexy times in bed where they try to make their partner orgasm more times. Wait. They probably have categories for their orgasms. Like longest, most intense, most frequent etc. Like I said, Fitz and Simmons have the best sex ever." False text
