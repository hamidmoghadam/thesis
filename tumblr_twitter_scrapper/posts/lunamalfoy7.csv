More on that later.)  Included in my group of friends was my friend Anna who had recently come forward as trans. She had very recently started presenting as a woman, and was pretty insecure in it, and had never met my father previously, so it wasn’t as though I had time to brief him on the situation. Anna was pretty shy during the whole ride, tucked in the back and letting her friends talk over her. She only spoke up after I had gotten my car back, thanking him for helping out. The next day, I called to thank him for that night, and he asked me who was the girl with the deep voice. At first my heart sink in my guts, but without missing a beat, he started raving about how he LOVED her voice. He listed off a few actresses from his day who had had very deep voices, and how he adored it, and that kind of slow sultry speaking had been fading more and more as pop culture pushed for childish voices in women. Your deep voice is gorgeous trans friends (and cis friends too.) it is warm and low and smooth like honey and perfect in every way. It is smoldering and evocative and absolutely beautiful.

During a speech to Muslims in Saudi Arabia, Trump referred to “Islamic extremism” instead of “Islamist extremism,” as had been written. While that may sound like a distinction without a difference, Reuters explains: The term “Islamist extremism” refers to Islamism as a political movement rather than Islam as a religion, a distinction that the Republican president had frequently criticized the administration of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, for making. Trump often referred to “Islamic extremism” and criticized President Obama for using the term “Islamist extremism.” But, because he is playing nicey-nicey with the Saudis, he tried to modulate his rhetoric, but he failed. His apparent exhaustion put him right back into campaign mode. That wasn’t the only symptom of his exhaustion. Following the speech, Trump was supposed to appear at the Tweeps Forum. Instead, he sent his daughter Ivanka. Trump is 70-years-old. His diet consists of chocolate cake, double scoops of ice cream on top of a cream pie, Kentucky Fried Chicken (and other fast food) and well-done steak with ketchup. As for exercise, well, he doesn’t. He thinks exercise kills people. You’d think he would be able to handle his nine-day trip. He claims he only needs three to four hours sleep a night.  It’s understandable that a man of his age and his fitness level would have trouble keeping up with the rigors of such an ambitious trip, but one can’t help but note the hypocrisy, especially after saying this about Hillary Clinton:“To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina,” Trump said in the first presidential debate. “You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals … with Japan, with Saudi Arabia.”  Source: Washington Examiner Trump is just one country in and he’s exhausted.  Three days into the trip.  Also  is daughter should never be filling in. When a president is sick they don’t have their children do their job they have people whose job it is to step in do it. So ignoring for the moment that he shouldn’t even be exhausted and if he really is too fucking bad, his kid shouldn’t be doing the job of the president. " False link
lunamalfoy7 160983409898 "2017-05-23 13:00:15 GMT" https://lunamalfoy7.tumblr.com/post/160983409898/the-killing-joke-doesnt-deserve-the-credit-for "dr-archeville:  Alan Moore and Brian Bolland’s classic and controversial Batman: The Killing Joke is making waves once again after the the animated adaptation debuted at San Diego Comic Con and reportedly doubled down on the damseling and objectification of Batgirl.  Without spoiling the changes (you can read about them here),  Barbara Gordon’s reliance on men’s approval is a big theme of the film,  and only serves to give Batman more angst when the events of the comic  play out. Fans of The Killing Joke will often defend it by pointing out that without the story, Barbara Gordon would not have become Oracle, the Batman family’s computer whiz and one of the most prominent disabled superheroes in comic books.  However, crediting The Killing Joke for the creation of Oracle is wholly inaccurate and does a disservice to the true creators of the reinvention, John Ostrander and Kim Yale. (Note: This article contains some language that readers may find upsetting.) The reinvention of Barbara Gordon as Oracle is often attributed to  Moore and Bolland, and as such the trauma and objectification she  endures in The Killing Joke are seen as justified.  According this argument, Oracle was the end goal, and Killing Joke should be lauded for everything that happened to Barbara Gordon afterwards. That  couldn’t be further from the truth, and Alan Moore has gone record  saying that Baraba’s trauma was an afterthought.  Quite famously, he  approached his editor Len Wein with the idea, seeking approval, and Wein responded with “Yeah, okay, cripple the bitch”. Brian Cronin’s A (Perhaps Unnecessary) Guide to Oracle’s Formative Years  goes into more detail about the timeline of Barbara Gordon’s  transformation into Oracle, and with one quote from John Ostrander,  proves itself to indeed be very necessary. “There were no plans for her in the continuity at that  time.  We decided that if that happened, we weren’t just going to make  her better magically — we wanted to explore what happened when someone  like her was crippled and how she would respond.” By the time The Killing Joke happened, Barbara Gordon had  retired as Batgirl and was living a peaceful civilian life.  She was  revived by Moore and Bolland solely to be assaulted — grievously and  sexually — by The Joker, all as part of his effort to get to her father and, by extension, Batman. There is a concept called the “Sexy Lamp test,” coined by writer Kelly Sue DeConnick, that  says If you can take out a female character out of a story and replace  her with a sexy lamp you are, to quote DeConnick, “a f—— hack!”. So let’s apply that to The Killing Joke.  Barbara Gordon is nothing more than a sexy lamp to Commissioner Gordon  and Batman, an object that they like a lot, which The Joker can exploit  to hurt them.  At the end of the story, no-one cares about the lamp or  its future. It took John Ostrander and Kim Yale to reintroduce Barbara Gordon as the computer savvy hacker Oracle in the pages of Suicide Squad, giving the character new purpose and showing that disabled people aren’t broken, and they certainly aren’t disposable. As a member of the Suicide Squad, Barbara proved that people with  disabilities can be superheroes too, and the character had enough  support from the likes of Barbara Kesel, Denny O’Neil and Chuck Dixon to survive the end of Suicide Squad and become one of the most iconic DC characters of the ’90s. The Killing Joke is a classic comic, but it can still be  criticized for its misogynistic treatment of the one female character in  the comic.  When you give credit to Alan Moore and Brian Bolland for  starting Barbara Gordon on the path to becoming Oracle, you’re not only  wrong, but you diminish the legacy of two of the most underrated  creators of that era.  Saying The Killing Joke is responsible for Barbara Gordon becoming Oracle is like saying the “Death (and Return) of Superman” story was responsible for Hal Jordan becoming The Spectre. " False link

I came prepared, with printed and highlighted court cases, state statutes, and title IX excerpts. They didn’t listen, and refused to provide notes on the meeting or confirm that they had plans to punish me. I listened for about a week, and like before, I grew bolder, and stopped. I concurrently sent a FOIA Request for the communication between the school administration and the attorney, and after that was denied, submitted another request for a clarification of what happened in the meeting and the guidance they had given me. I was called down to my dean’s office and told to calm down. I didn’t. I instead sent my principal a letter and CC’d every faculty member of importance at the school. Mr. Jay Hoffmann and Associates, I regret to inform you that I sustained a mild head trauma some time before break, I am in fair condition and high spirits, but I must alert you to the fact that my memory was slightly affected by the incident and I have lost the ability to recall a particular event that took place in mid October, 2011. While I am not completely able to remember the exact happenings of said event, through a series of email searches I have managed to determine that this meeting concerned my ability to use the bathroom while attending school, but I have no recollection as to what specifically happened at the aforementioned meeting. If there happened to be anything of importance said during the October meeting concerning special instructions on how I am supposed to function within the school due to your understanding of my body or identity, I would like to know. Due to my active role within my community, the chances of me sustaining another memory altering head injury within the near future are staggeringly high — if you and your staff would like to avoid explaining what happened in the initial meeting and subsequent meetings with great frequency, as further head injuries occur, I highly suggest that you provide me with an official letter concerning any special instructions or punitive actions to be taken against me if I fail to comply. Since this head injury, I have used the school’s facilities as permitted by the Illinois Human Rights Act and will continue to do so until I am told differently in writing. Please note that any punitive actions taken against me will most likely result in a filing with the Human Rights Committee, FOIA requests for all communications pertaining to the event, press releases, news tips, and the raising of community awareness. I didn’t get called to the office anymore after this. In fact, the administration refused to speak with me until after I graduated. I didn’t get in trouble, and since I left, there have been roughly a dozen other trans kids who have gone un-bothered by the administration Could this have gone differently, particularly if I wasn’t in a state with laws on the books to help me? Definitely. But the point is, draconian laws are much harder to enforce on people who will fight you. If you’re a trans high schooler, have Title IX complaints typed up — yes, you can still file those — and let your administration know that you have them. Go scream at your school board until they carry you out. Show up at your principal’s office until you become a nuisance. Fax your superintendent until their machine runs out of ink. Send FOIA requests for everything you can think of, costing your school time and money. They want us to cower, so don’t.  I am proud to share a state with this young woman. Fantastic work, @alx-972 and that’s some seriously awesome lateral thinking.  Congratulations on graduation and keep fighting and inspiring!  hell yes.  this woman is my new role model.   I’ve had the opportunity to work with @alx-972 before when we were both younger. She’s a great person. Hey!  I wanted to clarify again that I am not Alex Sennello (username similarity aside), I just read and shared her article. Not only is there more at the link, but I’m sure she’d love to hear from you in the comments on Medium. " False link

In July last year, the court heard Lane stole Ms Grice’s keys and broke into her home to watch her sleep. He was cautioned for this offence and told to stay away from her, but Ms Grice’s complaints that he was following her and making “heavy breathing” calls were apparently labelled as “low risk” by police.”  27 year old man abusing a 19 year old woman… but yeah low risk for sure  This is the police. Don’t forget. Ever. Reporting is bullshit in a system built and run by people (men) who have a stake in keeping you scared and abused all without consequence for the male abuser.  “But why don’t women just report their abuse to the police?!?”  The police have the stalkers back when they charge the victim, eh? I guess they relate more to the perp than the victim. How could they know she would end up dead just because it happens every day?  this is why i fucking cringe when MRA’s talk about how women have such an advantage when it comes to accusing men of violent and sexual crimes " False link

The teacher’s rebuttal:  I just commented this on a transphobic post that was all like, “In a sexual species, females have two X chromosomes and males have an X and a Y, I’m not a bigot it’s just science.” I’m a science teacher so I responded with this. First of all, in a sexual species, you can have females be XX and males be X (insects), you can have females be ZW and males be ZZ (birds), you can have females be females because they developed in a warm environment and males be males because they developed in a cool environment (reptiles), you can have females be females because they lost a penis sword fighting contest (some flatworms), you can have males be males because they were born female, but changed sexes because the only male in their group died (parrotfish and clownfish), you can have males look and act like females because they are trying to get close enough to actual females to mate with them (cuttlefish, bluegills, others), or you can be one of thousands of sexes (slime mold, some mushrooms.) Oh, did you mean humans? Oh ok then. You can be male because you were born female, but you have 5-alphareductase deficiency and so you grew a penis at age 12. You can be female because you have an X and a Y chromosome but you are insensitive to androgens, and so you have a female body. You can be female because you have an X and a Y chromosome but your Y is missing the SRY gene, and so you have a female body. You can be male because you have two X chromosomes, but one of your X’s HAS an SRY gene, and so you have a male body. You can be male because you have two X chromosomes- but also a Y. You can be female because you have only one X chromosome at all. And you can be male because you have two X chromosomes, but your heart and brain are male. And vice - effing - versa. Don’t use science to justify your bigotry. The world is way too weird for that shit.   Addressing this to the TERF that assaulted me. " False link
