This proposed budget eliminates funding for IMLS, a federal agency that provides critical support for Native American, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian libraries across the country. The American Indian Library Association (AILA) is calling on all tribal librarians, archivists, community members, and the public to share stories to help us fight for continued federal funding for the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). We are seeking short stories from your communities to demonstrate the role tribal libraries play in supporting culture, community, and education. Use this form to share your story and upload any photos to accompany your story. Funding for Native American libraries and information services has been a long struggle for those committed to the development of libraries in Indian Country since the 1970s. Strong and consistent advocacy from American Indian leaders helped to secure federal funding that would be used by tribes, for tribes, to meet their library and information needs. Vine Deloria, Jr. and other American Indian leaders have reminded us that the federal support of tribal library services is a function of Indian treaty rights as tribes sacrificed land and resources in exchange for educational services.  Our communities stand to lose millions in federal support for childhood literacy, language revitalization, digital infrastructure, college and vocational prep, job-seeking support, and so much more. In some cases, IMLS provides the only consistent source of library funding. In a very real way, the defunding of IMLS could mean the loss of tribal libraries. " False text

Transgender students deserve the right to use restroom facilities that are aligned with their gender identity. On average students spend 6-7 hours per day at school, and every student deserves to learn in an environment free from discrimination. We believe this federal policy must be reinstated because it ensures that all students are treated fairly nationwide. “ALA, its members, all librarians and library professionals are committed to diversity, inclusiveness, and mutual respect for all human beings, and we will work tirelessly to ensure full representation of all members of society. “ALA provides gender neutral restrooms at our conferences, and we will not hold our large and economically impactful meetings in states where ‘bathroom bills’ have been passed. Our Association for Library Service to Children (ALSC) division canceled one such program in North Carolina last year.  “We stand with our transgender members, colleagues, families and friends, and we fully support the work of our Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Round Table (GLBTRT), whose members continue to lead the fight to abolish intolerance for all of society. “ALA will work closely with all of its partners for reinstatement of these protections as soon as possible.” View the press release here or here.

Turn that commitment into action by building a strong team that will be ready to put strategies into action on day one.Think about who has stepped up for and is passionate about your library. Who would be an effective spokes­person? Who has connections in the community you can leverage? Who has time to devote? Who can organize tasks and people? It’s not just your board and Friends. Think about patrons, community/opinion leaders, and moms and dads who are committed to the library’s programs and services. Put together a core group of five to ten people who are forward thinking and can plan for future efforts. Use online tools such as Google Calendar, Google Groups, and Google Drive to keep everyone informed.Create your advocacy plan. Now that you’ve got a core group together, figure out what your goal is. Is there a library budget or building referendum ballot in your future? Do you need to impress upon your local municipality the importance of increasing the library’s funding? Once you know your goal, you can map out objectives such as messaging and campaign branding, community outreach for support, phone banking and other voter identification activities, outreach to elected officials, Get Out the Vote, etc.Figure out who is doing what. Who will write materials? Who will speak with the press? Who will coordinate community outreach and presentations? Who has the relationship with the mayor and local elected officials? These are all important questions you ask—and then need to answer—while creating your plan. The core of any effective advocacy team is the willingness to take responsibility for tasks. It’s not enough for folks to say, “Yeah, I’ll help out.” We need team members to say, “Yes, I’ll schedule all the public presentations,” or “I’ll coordinate the campaign’s messaging,” or “I’ll organize the phone banks.”Determine library stakeholders and get them involved. Reaching out to library stakeholders and other community/opinion leaders is essential. You don’t necessarily want them on the core team, but you do want them speaking out on behalf of your library’s goal. Voters and elected officials expect to hear how important the library is from trustees, Friends, or active volunteers. But hearing your library’s advocacy message from the president of the local chamber of commerce, the chair of the Rotary Club, the head of the school board, or the president of the Little League will carry as much, if not more, weight because they are not directly related to the library. Once you identify these folks, ask them to speak out at specific venues or meetings and make sure they have your talking points. They can fashion them to match up with their own thoughts, but these stakeholders have to stay on the library’s message.Have a campaign calendar that drives your advocacy goal. Make sure everyone involved knows what has to be done when. Keep adding to the calendar—community meetings, deadlines for mailing materials, dates for phone banking. Having an advocacy plan that is driven by a calendar that the team has access to and can add to will keep everyone on task. Building an Advocacy Team and Getting It Engaged by Libby Post" True text
