Both my parents are mixed. I have white family on both sides,” she said. “The older I get, the more I experience life, I am identifying more and more with being black, and what that means — being more and more proud of that and feeling connected to my roots and my history.”Kravitz said attending predominantly white schools often made her feel disconnected from her blackness growing up and that fully embracing her identity was sometimes a struggle. “It’s been a really interesting journey because I was always one of the only black kids in any of my schools,” she said. “I went to private schools full of white kids. I think a lot of that made me want to blend in or not be looked at as black.”“The white kids are always talking about your hair and making you feel weird,” she added. “I had this struggle of accepting myself as black and loving that part of myself.”Kravitz said she has since evolved and experienced a “big shift” in her life that has led her to fully embrace her identity and take pride in being black, which she says especially means a lot to her father, who is no stranger to unapologetic expression.“Now I’m so in love with my culture and so proud to be black,” she said. “It’s still ongoing, but a big shift has occurred. My dad especially has always been very connected to his history, and it’s important to him that I understand where I come from.” (cont. HuffPo) Keep that in mind because I’m coming back to it, but first I want to address The Real Housewives of Potomac aka The Sisterhood of the Travelling Vanessa Williamses.A bit of history on this show for those who are interested and/or aren’t familiar.  (You can skip this paragraph if this doesn’t appeal to you.)  The first season of this show had a decidedly tepid reception, especially from the Black community to which it was marketed given that it was bundled with The Real Housewives of Atlanta.  So many of the episodes seemed to revolve around etiquette, decorum, manners, behavior in their social circle of elite Black folks in Potomac, which was already a stretch because A) some of them didn’t live in Potomac and B) Black folks only make up 4.6% of Potomac.  We were all worn out from hearing them give each other lectures on how to behave in social situations, but that’s how the show was pitched to the cast by Bravo.  It was supposed to be a look at a group of women associated with Jack & Jill of America, the bougie, elitist Black organization based in Washington DC and how they represent themselves and the organization.  J&J heard about the show and told Bravo they wanted no part of it, they wanted no association with Bravo, and they wanted no mention of Jack & Jill on Bravo, ever.  So, the show was re-tooled about three-quarters of the way through filming and became a Real Housewives franchise instead.  The second season is decidedly less focused on manners and feels more like the rest of the franchise, but if you managed to finish last season like I did, you caught some very real conversations about race that I personally had never seen on television before.In the first season, there were two mixed cast members: Ashley (white mom, Black dad)and Katie (Black mom, white (Jewish) dad)There were also two very light, very blonde women who did not consider themselves mixed at all:Robynand GizelleDuring one argument, Robyn asks Katie a question about white men (both Katie and Ashley were in relationships with white men, while Robyn & Gizelle only date Black men) and Katie makes the point that she’s biracial and so are Gizelle and Robyn.  Robyn and Gizelle both say they’re Black because they have no direct white ancestor, and that’s a topic that never really gets fleshed out when we talk about race in America.(I assume by “direct white ancestor” she meant no white parents or grandparents because clearly someone is white further down her tree and almost certainly more than a few people.)Katie and Ashley both grew up in a household with one Black parent and one white parent.  They were exposed to both sides.  They grew up as biracial girls.  The fact that both of them are dating white men also speaks to that point because – like it or not, the facts can’t be denied – Black women are less likely to date outside of their race than any other demographic.  Two biracial women in a cast of six both married to or dating white men definitely lends more credence to that statistic, that you are more likely to date a white man if you are a biracial Black woman than if consider yourself to be only Black.Robyn and Gizelle, phenotypically, appear much closer to white than Katie, but both of them are Black women because they didn’t grow up with a white parent.  Obviously they both are children of mixed parents and it could go back generations.  Because of colorism and “passing” and the paper bag test, there are quite a number of Black families in this country where everyone looks more like Gizelle than Katie because to maintain that social capital from Reconstruction through the Civil Rights movement, they only married other very light skinned Black people who were also the products of mixed parentage at some point in their history.  But.  They’re still Black.  Both of Gizelle’s parents went to segregated schools in the South.  When her father was elected to the Texas House of Representatives in 1966, he was among the first Black Representatives in that state since 1896 (two other Black candidates were elected in the same year).  The reason Gizelle and Robyn are so connected to their Blackness is because they are the children of mixed Black people who were born in the 30s and 40s.  You didn’t identify as “mixed” back then.  If you had any Negro blood, you were Black and you lived with all of the restrictions that being Black shackled you with.Zoe Kravitz is the child of mixed parents who were born in the late 60s.  Lisa Bonet and Lenny Kravitz both have one white parent and one Black parent, but neither of them remember an America before the Civil Rights movement.  Lenny Kravtiz grew up in Beverly Hills even further removed from the day-to-day issues of being Black in America.  Lisa Bonet grew up on the Cosby Show as part of America’s Ideal Black Family, but clearly she doesn’t move through the world the way a mixed Black woman like Tracee Ellis Ross does.  It seems trite and superficial to point it out, but it’s relevant to how we contextualize race.  Because race is a social construct, most of how we perceive it is based on social interaction and the society in which we live.  A mixed woman who looks like Lisa Bonet benefits from more social capital and privilege than a mixed woman who looks like Halle Berry.Now you can see a distinct contrast between a Black-identifying woman like Gizelle Bryant who grew up with two Black-identifying parents of the pre-Civil Rights Movement, and a mixed-identifying woman like Zoe Kravitz who grew up with two mixed-identifying parents of entertainment industry in a more accepting racial climate.  Even now, Zoe has a long road ahead of her on her way to full acceptance of her Blackness and how she moves through the world because she has yet to address the benefits of her mixed heritage.  Because of how light she is, she gets to be the token speck of color in all white casts like Little Big Lies and that horrendous looking Scarlett Johansson comedy coming out soon, while also serving as the love interest in a Black cast for movies like Dope. I think we’re in a time where “mixed” as a self-identifier is finally becoming socially acceptable.  At the same time, mixed and Black aren’t mutually exclusive, because race being the social construct that it is, most mixed people are still considered Black by the world.  Still, that doesn’t take into account that they have two distinct cultures and parental histories that inform their upbringing.  I had a conversation like this with a mixed Black woman a few weeks ago who’d had an argument in college about how she identifies.  Zoe Kravitz is definitely mixed and I don’t want to take any of that away from her.  But she’s also a Black woman with a voice and a platform and in this political and social climate, I’m glad to see that she’s starting to embrace that more."

It overturned “separate but equal,“ ending legal school segregation. Students were finally able to say the Pledge of Allegiance together. (Facebook: NAACP) This is three years old, but I just saw the memory and these things always make me think of my parents, neither of whom ever shared a school with white kids even though they graduated long after this ruling.  Our ""history” is so current, and the people who were alive during this fight and pushing back against integration are currently our teachers, police officers, elected officials, judges, and bankers.  Attorney General Jeff Sessions, an Alabama native of Wilcox County, was 8-years-old when Brown vs. the Board of Education was settled, and this New York Times article from 1972 – eighteen years later –  shows how upset white families remained long after public schools were supposedly integrated.  White parents in Wilcox County pulled their kids out of public schools when the faculty was finally ordered to desegregate because they didn’t want Black teachers instructing their white children.  In the twenty years between the end of segregated schools and this article, only one Black student had graduated from a traditionally white high school in Wilcox County, the county where Jeff Sessions received his diploma.  Those twenty years were filled with lawsuits, protests, strikes, and violence because Wilcox County was a predominantly Black county deep in the Black Belt of the South, which means every public school would have more Black students than white if schools were integrated with respect to the area’s racial makeup.Guy S. Kelley, the superintendent of schools for Wilcox County, locked his hands behind his head, leaned back in his chair and began a discussion of some of his problems as a professional educator.“They won’t leave us alone,” he philosophized, pausing momentarily to adjust the weight of the 32‐ caliber revolver dangling in a shoulder holster beneath his left arm pit. “Ever since we lost the war—let’s see now, that’s been about a hundred years, isn’t it?— they’ve been kicking us around like we was dirt.”(cont. New York Times) They would be the Federal Government and the Department of Justice, where one of their own is now supposedly leading the charge to ensure that the law is just and that the system works for all Americans.  I’m not saying a disposition toward equality and fairness is impossible for a white man hailing from a community in the Deep South that was so against integration that all the white kids were pulled out of school two decades after the Supreme Court ruled because they didn’t want to be taught by Black teachers, but it’s highly improbable.  By comparison, Bill Clinton’s school district was integrated with very little fanfare, he memorized the “I Have a Dream” speech, and his grandparents, who owned a store, sold goods on credit to both white and Black customers.  That’s about the best you can hope for from the South out of that generation, and we still got a massive expansion of the prison system that will take generations to undo.There are versions of Jeff Sessions at every level of government.  When someone tells me “slavery was so long ago” as if that fixes all of the problems, I think about my parents, whose first day-to-day interactions with white people were at their first jobs where none of my mom’s co-workers would sit at the same lunch table with her, where my dad carried a knife because of workplace skirmishes with Southern white men who also never went to integrated schools.  I know these stories because my parents told me.  On the other side of that lunchroom, where all the white women sat who wouldn’t sit with my mom, other stories were being formed.  Those women had kids too and I’m sure they told the same stories.  I just wonder what their version is like."

Original stars Roseanne Barr (Roseanne), John Goodman (Dan), Sara Gilbert (Darlene), Laurie Metcalf (Jackie), Michael Fishman (D.J.), and Lecy Goranson (Becky) will appear on the show, which will also feature Sarah Chalke (who played Becky in later seasons) in an undefined role.“The Conners’ joys and struggles are as relevant — and hilarious — today as they were then, and there’s really no one better to comment on our modern America than Roseanne,” Dungey in a press release.(cont. EW) Roseanne is one of my favorite television shows of all time and of my top 20, only the Golden Girls, the Comeback, and Roseanne have all-white casts.  I grew up during the Golden Age of Black Sitcoms because from the late 80s through the early 00s, I could always turn on the television and see people who looked like me.(And then there was that dead space between the end of My Wife & Kids and the debut of Blackish where there were literally no Black television shows on network television.)The point I’m making is, I watched Living Single instead of Friends.  I watched Girlfriends instead of Will & Grace.  But honestly, I also watched Roseanne instead of the Cosby Show, because it was funnier, and looking back on it, more socially relevant.  It was such a smart show and an almost perfect capsule of that time, and that’s why I want them to leave it alone!Exhibit A:  The last season was the worst final season in the history of great television shows.  I don’t even watch the last season anymore and I pretend it doesn’t exist.  What is the continuity supposed to be like when the show comes back?  We learn in the finale that most of the series was a work of fiction in Roseanne’s mind, that Dan was actually dead, that Jackie is a lesbian, and it was the worst closure to any TV show.  Are they going to pretend that last season didn’t happen?Exhibit B: We are living in Trump’s America.  Say what you want about the median income of Trump voters being higher than the media will lead you to believe, that still doesn’t discount the fact that poor white families in the Midwest overwhelmingly voted for him.  In my mind, the Conners were on my side of every important issue from gay marriage to the economy.  Also in my mind, a lot of white families like that in real life were on my side of the important issues and still voted for Trump because they just “didn’t trust Hillary” or some other lame explanation as a front for their white paranoia.Exhibit C:  Roseanne Barr today is not the Roseanne Barr of the 90s.  I can’t stand her.  I don’t know what happened between then and now, but her commentary on the world is always off and more often than not, she completely contradicts herself.  Y'all, she was out here trashing Hillary because Hillary was a career politician and, according to Roseanne, you can’t get that way without taking money from shady characters.  All the while she’s praising Donald for being a man about law & order even though he’s one of the shady characters who tried to buy politicians!  She was pro-Trump because she believes “illegal immigrants come here and get a lot of benefits that our own veterans don’t get.”  She literally said “We would be so lucky if Trump won.”  I don’t want This Roseanne writing another season of one of my favorite television shows. Every single attack on @POTUS is really a disguised attack on American voters who rejected Obama-Clinton-Bush’s bleeding of R treasury.— Roseanne Barr (@therealroseanne) March 20, 2017 Hopefully some information will start to leak out once it goes into production so I can gauge whether or not I should be tuning in for the premiere.  In the meantime, I still have old Roseanne episodes to go on.  It will be great to see Laurie Metcalfe back on television again now that Getting On is off the air.Oo!  And ABC is also Shondaland!  They should do a crossover with Cyrus and bring back the crazy lady.Randomly looked up that crazy lady on Scandal to see if her Southern accent was real and her parents are Jackie and Cyrus. Random. #Scandal pic.twitter.com/p96JHlXBjm— Marine Le Flop (@RafiDAngelo) May 5, 2017 (They shouldn’t really do that.  I just wanna make sure y’all know who the crazy lady’s parents are because my mind was blown.)"

I love all the extra punctuation.  I can just see the flurry of fingers and the angry little expression as @blackwidowlatex came up with his ultimate Ha! Gotcha! moment, as if that argument was so watertight no one would ever be able to counter it.  You know what else isn’t mentioned in the Bill of Rights?  Freedom from slavery, yet here we are, as decent human beings, with the knowledge that you shouldn’t be able to buy and sell people.  The Bill of Rights isn’t the beginning and the end of how an advanced society is supposed to treat its citizens.  I’m not sure if you know this or not, but the Bill of Rights is just the first ten amendments to the Constitution and we’ve been amending it ever since because – you may want to sit down, I don’t want to shock you – legal documents written by rich white men (who lack any familiarity with demographics outside of their own) sometimes have to be adjusted to be inclusive of the population as a whole. Trying to draw these distinctions between what is expressly set down in law and what is acceptable behavior because we’re an advanced society of supposedly logical people is the reason why President Velveeta is able to do half the crap he gets away with. Keep reading  I don’t know where that report was from or what the situation was, but a few years ago my mother was bitten by a cottonmouth (a deadly snake in the southern USA) and her bill wasn’t nearly that high. She was perfectly fine. However, when she was in college she almost died because she had an asthma attack in Canada and couldn’t get into a hospital due to the overcrowding as a result of free healthcare. She was lucky to get into New York to go to the hospital.  4 things: 13th, 14th, 15th and 19th amendments. Not the “Bill of Rights,” but they all guarantee rights to non-whitemen. The 14th especially has been used to grant rights to minority groups, yet there is nothing that guarantees the right to anything for free, even health or support.  Also, I hate to tell you, but Barron Trump is going to go to private school no matter where he lives, and it is very difficult for a child (especially one in his situation) to move schools so abruptly. I do not believe any presidential child has gone to public school in DC, ever.  1) http://www.cbsnews.com/news/rattlesnake-selfie-results-in-a-153k-medical-bill/2) You’re missing the point.  It doesn’t have to be in black & white for it to be a right in a decent society.3) We paid a million dollars a day (actual cost is closer to a million every two days) to cover the cost of protecting Melania and Barron in Trump Tower because they refused to move to the White House in the middle of the school year, like the Obamas and the Clintons did.  They kept him in school in New Jersey instead of moving to DC to put him in school there.  It’s not about the cost of his education – that doesn’t come out of taxpayer funds.4) You wasted a lot of time."

Reuters) This non-ruling from the Supreme Court sets absolutely no precedent and has no implications for future cases of restrictive voting legislation, but it’s still a relief.  The way this SCOTUS is set up at the moment, there’s no certainty that the 4th Circuit’s ruling wouldn’t have been overturned and North Carolina would’ve continued it’s descent into the abyss of white paranoia and bigotry.I’m not going to take you back down all of the history.  I wrote about the Court’s neutering of the Voting Rights Act in 2013 and then I wrote about this very law coming out of North Carolina a few weeks later after basically being given the green light by the Court.  I just want to draw attention to the fact that the Conservative/Liberal balance of the Supreme Court in 2013 was the same as it is right now.  So, the Court that chunked the most important part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is basically the same Court that would have to rule on voting legislation coming out of North Carolina, legislation that the NC Congress and Pat McCrory pushed into law as soon as it became possible to do so under the weakened VRA.  North Carolina wanted to make it harder for minorities, young people, and older people to vote – all demographics that skew Democrat – and they succeeded.  The NAACP appealed and Circuit 4 ruled in favor of justice, so the law became null and void.  Then North Carolina appealed to the Supreme Court.  The reason this case is being thrown out is because of the bickering back and forth over who should be allowed to take responsibility for it.  This issue is a Republican cause and it has made its way to the highest court in the land on the backs of a Republican governor and a Republican attorney general.  Neither of those two people are in office any longer and the Democrats currently holding those posts in North Carolina have no desire to put this case in front of the Supreme Court.  They have the ruling they want right now, from the 4th Circuit.  They risk the Supreme Court ruling in favor of discrimination if they swing for a precedent-setting determination in this case.  NC Republicans in Congress say the case should go forward, the governor and the AG are understandably reluctant to move it forward, and the Court has refused to hear it on the basis of that legal wrangling alone, not because of the merits of the case.  So this issue isn’t decided for the country, but for North Carolina it’s dead for at least another election cycle until there’s enough Republican support from top to bottom to write new legislation to keep Democrats out of the voting booth.  It’s a win on a technicality, but we gotta take what we can get at this point."

Overly Confident Alexis says she’s fine going first or last, since those are the two hardest parts and I guess she wants to shine.  However, she’s still in her head about the reading challenge because the other queens read her about her size, but Alexis……didn’t you just say Shea was gnawing on set pieces?  Body is something you can actually change relatively cheaply, but with lots of effort and determination.  You’re stuck with your teeth unless you have a whole lot of money to fix them, and Shea isn’t in the corner crying about something she has no control over.  However!RuPaul comes in with Ross Matthews and during their little convo with Alexis, she says that the other girls knew about her body image issues and it was something they had all discussed.  So I see her point. If someone says they’re insecure about their body and that they’re struggling with it, why would you make fun of it?  Especially when there’s so much more to work with.Of course RuPaul Andre If You Let Words Hurt You That’s Your Own Problem Charles just disregards that part of the conversation, where Alexis points out it’s a sensitive issue for her that she’s talked about with the girls, and boils it down to Alexis making fun of others but others not being able to make fun of Alexis.Farrah gets a little consult where she says she doesn’t want to be mean because it doesn’t come naturally to her, so Ross gives her some advice there since his brand is also pretty upbeat and jovial.  Let’s see if she takes that advice to heart.Peppermint is funny, but she hasn’t been very witty at all, so who knows how this roast is going to turn out for her since that’s not part of her personality or her act. And Sasha is intellectual so nobody knows how that’s going to translate into roasting a very average “celebrity” to a room of very average people.So the bottom two and the winner are all in that consultation edit with Ross and Ru, obviously, because that’s how the show works, and you might as well call Farrah for the bottom two.  Is this the week she finally goes home?This week’s Backstories While We Beat is super short and centers on Peppermint being detained in Russia 8 months ago.  (The show was shot in 2016, so I’m guessing it was the tail end of 2015 or the very beginning of last year.)  She was presenting as female, which is actually illegal there, but her ID says male, so the agent at the airport flagged her and she was detained.  She took her wig off in line to prove her identity matched the one on the ID, but Peppermint says that still doesn’t take away her womanhood.  Werq, Miss Agnes.I’m here for these glimpses into her trans identity.Time to see what tired jokes these queens wrote about Michelle Visage.  But!  Before we get into the roast, please get into Tamar Braxton’s beat for this episode!!  Refresh your memory with this snap from her last appearance.God bless a drag reality show for forcing you to step up your contouring game!(Try to ignore whatever is going wrong with her weave closure and I’ll try to ignore everything that is going wrong with your life as well.)Anyway, there’s no runway challenge this week, so I'ma throw some pics in here with the queens’ best lines from their performance.Shea Coulee had a few predictable lines about Michelle Visage being a slut (why is that always the go-to? did I miss a tell all biography or something) but she killed me with her closer.If you liked my performance, my name is Shea Coulee.  And if you hated it, my name is Nina Bo'Nina Brown.Sasha Velour just keeps surprising me!  She read everybody on the stage before she hit me with her Jersey Jokes.Michelle is so Jersey her idea of classical music is Lisa Lisa.To get that reference probably takes a certain level of familiarity with 80s pop culture, but I just tweeted a video from Lisa Lisa earlier this week because my neighbor was jamming to it, so it was right in my ballpark.  YAAAAAAAAAAAASSSS!  I used to LOVE this song.  I don’t think I ever knew who it was by. https://t.co/Gq0obhWQkA— Marine Le Flop (@RafiDAngelo) May 11, 2017 Plus, this look is kind of everything and I’m finally getting into her style.  I have to add one more from Sasha while she was introducing the next queen:A queen who combines all the excitement of smiling with the thrill of just standing there, give it up for Valentina!Valentina committed to her Latina Peg Bundy, but she didn’t really deliver anything.  She kind of hit once.Michelle is such a cochina, she can say and spell harder in six different languages.Trinity Taylor’s only successful joke landed because of her costume and because Valentina was up before her.Thank you, Pedro.  Moh-wee, bee-yin.Farrah Moan landed zero punchlines because she’s a complete waste of space in this competition.  She is very lucky Tamar didn’t go straight Baltimore on her ass because she did not sign up for this at all.Tamar Braxton.  She’s Toni Braxton’s less talented, more annoying sister.GIRRRRRRRRRRL!Thank GOD she bombed in such an epic fashion.  There’s no way she’s escaping the bottom two.Peppermint came out and slayed!  Who knew she had all these jokes in her!  Every punchline landed, her energy was right, and her delivery was perfect.  Not since Destiny’s Child has a Michelle become so famous for riding someone else’s coattails.She definitely made up for that disastrous snatch game where I just wrote her off as a bubbly entertainer with nothing to say.Nina Bo'Nina Brown came out in character, which was very smart, because it forced her to speak more slowly and it gave her a funny place to launch from.  None of her jokes really landed, but she did give me my biggest laugh of the night when she looked at Fortune Feimster and, in her nice-nasty old Black Southern woman way that we all know, asked:What’s your name baby?I didn’t know either!  I had to look her up just now in order to get her name correct for this lil recap.Alexis Michelle’s Elphaba from Patterson New Jersey who didn’t paint her feet was the most uncomfortable thing I’ve seen on the show this season.  I don’t have to say anything.  You can just look at the reactions.Clearly she’s in the bottom, and though I’ve seen her live and it’s nothing overly impressive or exciting, Farrah is literally a waste of time and Alexis should easily out lip-sync her.Before the judges critiques, Valentina and Nina Bo'Nina Brown Earl Jones are both safe, which is totally acceptable.  They both landed like one good joke and that’s it.Shea is in the top because she opened the show with the right tone, energy, and laughs.  Sasha is in the top because she was able to show what a roast would like like from her very specific kind of POV.  Tamar said “she was really smart about being smart” which really is a breakthrough, because y'all know I thought her intelligence and intellectualism (<– actual word, I’m smart too, hoe) would ultimately defeat her.  Peppermint rounds out the top three because she had the best energy and the best jokes and none of them fell flat.  The judges say that’s the best she’s ever looked, but she looked like a very dated drag queen from a 2003 pageant to me so I’m not sure what curve they’re grading her on.None of Trinity’s jokes landed, so she’s in the bottom.None of Farrah’s jokes landed, so she’s in the bottom.None of Alexis’ jokes landed, so she’s in the bottom.Trinity got saved from the bottom two because she came out in a character that did manage to garner a few chuckles, so it’s Farrah vs. Alexis for the lip sync which was WIGGITY WHACK WHACK WHACK.  Alexis won, because look who she was going up against, but can we get into this lo-key shade from RuPaul toward Tamar?  Whenever a guest judge is a musician, the lip-sync done to something from their discography.  This season we’ve had Meghan Trainor and the B-52’s, but for Tamar’s episode, the lip sync was to Dolly Parton.  And let’s not say it’s because none of Tamar’s songs are recognizable enough since I for damn sure had never heard that Dolly song.  Plus, the last time Tamar was on the show as a judge, the girls faced off to Michel'le “No More Lies” and I’m positive the vast majority of the viewing audience has no idea who Michel'le is (or how to pronounce it correctly).The next time y'all have Tamar Braxton on the show, you better have a song queued up from her album.  I’m proposing “Catfish”or “Tip Toe.”Anyway, that’s that, and after this week, Sasha moves up for me once again.  She’s a lot more well-rounded that I gave her credit for at the beginning.5.

Anslinger is the root of marijuana legislation.  Anslinger worked for the Treasury during Prohibition and became the first commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics which was formed in 1930.  (Government note:  illegal narcotics – and alcohol back then – is enforced under the umbrella of the Treasury because they’re products which aren’t taxed and are therefore lost sources of revenue.)  Anslinger up until the 1930s said marijuana was not a problem and that any propaganda trying to paint it as a source of violent tendencies was absurd.  However, the government needed a new target once Prohibition ended and alcohol was legalized again, and Anslinger tied marijuana to Mexican immigrants and ramped up the propaganda campaign against it.  The federal government bought the lie that marijuana would make Mexicans (and Negroes) into violent savages coming to rape their white women, so marijuana was made illegal in 1937 and Anslinger was behind the first mandatory sentencing minimums – two to 10 years for your first possession.From the 1940s onward, research showed that marijuana didn’t cause any sort of “reefer madness” and in 1973, advisers made the suggestion to Nixon that marijuana be decriminalized because it’s safe.  Instead, he declared a war on drugs, which was actually a war on Black America and his political enemies.  The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.  – John Ehrlichman, Assistant to the President for Domestic AffairsSo that brings us up to date where marijuana prosecution is still a war on Black people.  Usage of marijuana is about equal in Black and white communities, but Black Americans are four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana.  Also, white people are more likely to use “harder” drugs, but marijuana – which causes no deaths, is used for medicinal purposes, is legal in many countries, and is legal in many states right here in this country – is still a schedule I narcotic alongside heroin.  Combined with the fact that marijuana makes up half of all drug arrests, and Jeff Secessions’ new directive to be tough on crime and roll back the Obama-era directives on prosecuting non-violent drug offenders means this is indeed war on Black communities again.Attorney General Jeff Sessions has a new directive for federal prosecutors across the country: charge suspects with the most serious offense you can prove.Friday’s announcement follows a line of several other significant departures from Obama-era domestic policies at the Justice Department, but this decision crystalized Sessions’ position in the criminal justice realm.“Charging and sentencing recommendations are bedrock responsibilities of any prosecutor and I trust our prosecutors in the field to make good judgment,” Sessions said Friday at a news conference in Washington. “They deserve to be un-handcuffed and not micromanaged from Washington.”In a brief one-and-a-half-page memo, Sessions outlined his new instructions for charging decisions in federal cases, saying that his new first principle is “that prosecutors should charge and pursue the most serious, readily provable offense.”“The most serious offenses are those that carry the most substantial guidelines sentence, including mandatory minimum sentences,” Sessions later added.(cont. CNN)Secessions is off the mark in every way, but two specific points.  Mandatory minimums are the definition of micromanaging from Washington.  He says prosecutors deserve to be un-handcuffed, but that would mean handing the discretion over to them when it comes to what charges should be on the table.  The related point goes in hand with those charges because the attorney general says the most serious charges are the ones that come with mandatory minimums, and that’s absolutely not the case, unless you’re basing your legal theory on racist propaganda from the 1930s that says marijuana is dangerous and causes violence against white women when we know that isn’t accurate.  If I steal $1000 or more, that’s grand theft, and the minimum sentence is usually 12 months of probation (though obviously you’ll get more time if you’ve stolen a lot more than $1,000).  If I’m also carrying marijuana, that could be a federal charge of possession with a minimum sentence of at least a year in prison.  Which one of those is more serious, the weed I want to smoke that doesn’t hurt me or anyone else or stealing property?  Attorney General Gump says the weed is more serious and he’s taken the discretion away from prosecutors to make that decision for themselves.Even more disastrous is the end to former Attorney General Eric Holder’s Smart On Crime initiative.  Holder and Obama realized drug possession is not always the marker of a criminal threat to society, so the goal of Smart on Crime was to reduce the number of felons behind bars for non-violent drug offenses.  If the accused had no violent criminal record, wasn’t tied to drug trafficking, and was not caught with a weapon or in the process of committing a violent crime, federal prosecutors were instructed to avoid any drug charges which would trigger a mandatory sentence.  Jeff Secessions formally put an end to that.  If you get caught with weed, you’re going to prison.  None of this matters to the blind apologists who answer any sort of judicial criticism with “if you committed a crime, you should go to prison, why are you trying to find ways to keep criminals on the streets.”  All arguments are lost on them, but some of them are your aunts, cousins, fathers, etc. so you can still try.  Put it simply.1) Weed is not harmful.  It’s an actual lie created by the government to demonize first Mexicans and then Black people.  That’s not a conspiracy theory – you can actually look up the words spoken by the people in power to make policy.2) The rate of usage for marijuana is the same for Blacks and whites, but Black people are arrested four times as frequently.  That means the police are targeting Black people.  Picture five white guys and five Black guys smoking a joint.  Four of the Black guys get arrested and only one of the white ones does.  That’s the actual statistic.3) The new attorney general is doing away with Obama’s efforts to mitigate that effects of policing prejudice.  He’s on the cable news circuit talking up evils of marijuana which do not exist and are based on racist propaganda from the 1930s.4) Being convicted of and then sentenced to prison for a crime that Connor isn’t even arrested for is one of the bottom rungs on a ladder of almost insurmountable hurdles toward equality in areas ranging from housing to employment.This is what happens when Coretta Scott King writes a 10-page letter against a racist but the country puts him in charge of the judicial system.  Let’s see what other ways he comes up with to make good on his racist history on the bench in Alabama."

Bills changing that have been introduced in the Missouri legislature for 19 years without getting much traction.“You can fire somebody for just cause if you find out they’re gay,” Engler said. “I think that’s sick. We should be disgusted we have that policy in this state.”Rep.

I’m gay today,” he said. “And it’s just a part of who I am.”But Rep.

Message every headless torso you find that says “masc vgl wm discreet 4 same” or some other iteration of such because, as a self-proclaimed expert in straight, closeted, bi-curious, or in-denial dick, I can see the faggotry in his eyes.Homophobes are almost always repressed gays.  We already know this.  And I’m telling you, Rick Brattin is the type of gay4pay amateur porn star that tells everyone how straight he is on Twitter every five seconds and then “retires” with some tacky interview about being tricked down the wrong path while praising some very average woman from Oklahoma named Rebecca Sue who saved him and brought him back to Christ…until he shows up 18 months later working for another gay porn site sporting different facial hair and a new tattoo.So.  Let’s start the countdown.  Somebody has nudes of him and just hasn’t realized he’s a homophobic politician.  Tell your Missouri gays to keep an eye open."

This is true for the simple reason that the Constitution is based on lasting principles of sound government that provide balance, stability, and consistency through time.

The radium basically destroyed them from the inside out to the point where some women walked around with handkerchiefs to soak up the constant seeping of pus and blood from their mouths while they picked out pieces of bone from their own jaw.And of course the companies responsible hushed up the results of investigations into radium poisoning, stole dead bodies before they could be autopsied, and repeatedly published false reports that working with radium was completely safe. Things didn’t begin to change until a man died, because obviously the women didn’t matter.With the report hushed up, the women’s biggest challenge was proving the link between their mysterious illnesses and the radium that they’d been ingesting hundreds of times a day. Though they themselves discussed the fact that their work must be to blame, they were fighting against the widespread belief that radium was safe. In fact, it was only when the first male employee of the radium firm died that experts finally took up the charge. In 1925, a brilliant doctor named Harrison Martland devised tests that proved once and for all that radium had poisoned the women.(cont.)  A perfect storm of capitalism and sexism led to unbelievably painful deaths for countless women and I had never even heard of this story.

The position of White House Chief Usher goes back to a time when someone would “usher” guests into the White House.

They are the head of the household responsible for every function it takes to run a mansion of that size and they oversee a budget of just under $20 million.It’s also a position that you don’t get fired from. You work until you resign for another job or until you retire. It’s not turned over with a change of administration and people have kept the position for decades, because running the White House as a home and public building is a detailed position wholly outside of the political arena.I think it’s just telling that Angella Reid got fired, ostensibly so Trump can appoint someone who he feels is loyal to him and not the position, someone he can trust not to write a tell all or leak his garbage behaviors to the press.

A federal judge on Tuesday blocked the Trump administration from enforcing a threat to take away funds from sanctuary cities – the latest blow from the federal judiciary to President Donald Trump’s immigration agenda.In his ruling, Judge William H. Orrick sided with Santa Clara County, the city of San Francisco and other jurisdictions, who argued that a threat to take away federal funds from cities that do not cooperate with some federal immigration enforcement could be unconstitutional.

That undermines the purpose of local law enforcement which exists to protect the people in their jurisdiction. Think of it this way: If you, as an undocumented immigrant, know that the police will deport you if they find out about you, you wouldn’t call the police when you or someone needed help. Mothers in domestic violence situations are especially vulnerable because they don’t want to be separated from their children so they avoid seeking help even though they’re being abused. The federal government can’t cut funding to local police when the police say “hey, we’re not going to assist your deportation efforts – that’s all on you.

Maybe this is widely represented in the progressive, ultraliberal bubbles I run in, maybe I just have a unique set of friends.

And because I remember a lot of these WPF foods growing up, and I remember exactly why we ate them: because they’re cheap as fuck. I compiled a list of every single specific food people sent me, and each one could feed a family of six for like five dollars. And they all were easy to make, too, because you really don’t want to spend a lot of time cooking (or washing a billion dishes after) when you’re trying to wrangle four kids and two dogs.

The gag is……this guy’s argument immediately defeats itself.  He  wants to define our hatred of White People Food among classist lines of “this is what poor white people eat” when soul food – the only great American cuisine – is based on scraps given to slaves who had to work to make food taste good.   White People Food, by definition, must not be Black People Food, yes?  But Black People Food *slash* Soul Food is poor people food and it’s one of the few culinary traditions that actually exists in this country.  I’m sorry none of y'all’s white ancestors took the time to make cheap ingredients into a culinary tradition that has spread around the globe, but it has nothing to do with class or access to better foods. Honestly…I don’t actually know why white people can’t cook.  (We already know that’s a generalization.  I don’t need you to send me your Grandma Susan’s recipe for Red Velvet Cake to combat it.)  But what I do know is this isn’t strictly an American issue and has nothing to do with class.  I don’t want to eat at your white friend’s house in the UK either – the food is too bland.  If you give me the choice between a French restaurant with a menu priced at X amount and an Indian restaurant with a menu priced at X amount, I’m going to choose the Indian restaurant.  Brown people make cheap food taste great.  You have to really come out of your wallet before you actually hit a quality level of French cuisine or English cuisine or German cuisine.So basically, white folks’ ancestors don’t have good culinary traditions for the average person (the Italians and the Greeks come closest, but there’s not a lot of variation in the ingredients).  The rest of us do.  So find another reason to cry about your unseasoned chicken breast."

Cummings (D-Md.) said they believe Flynn neither received permission nor fully disclosed income he earned for a speaking engagement in Russia and lobbying activities on behalf of Turkey when he applied to reinstate his security clearance. They reached this conclusion after viewing two classified memos and a financial disclosure form in a private briefing Tuesday morning.(cont.)So…Michael “Lock Her Up” Flynn didn’t disclose payments from Russia and Turkey before he applied for security clearance again. That’s a huge no-no, but if there’s no impropriety there and the payments were on the up and up, this could easily be smoothed over by making public the details of his travel, payments, engagements, and activities before and after Trump named him National Security Adviser, a position he had to give up when he was caught lying about other contact with Russia. You’d think the White House would want this all to go away.So the House Oversight Committee asked the White House for its information on Flynn, and the White House said “no.” They wrote a letter and basically said That Ain’t Your Business.Clearly there’s something to hide there. Can’t wait to see if former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates has anything to say about this, because you know she was fired for going against Trump’s Muslim ban and they’ve since tried to block her from testifying about his relationship with Russia. She definitely won’t answer any questions with That Ain’t Your Business." True link
