He claws his way up and out of the cold and damp and crushing weight, holding his breath, chest aching. As soon as he breaks the surface, he lies there, still half buried, and gasps in lungful after lungful of cold, fresh air. It’s only when his breathing finally calms that he pulls himself the rest of the way out of the ground. He tries to stand but winds up falling to all fours, fabric of his damp clothes chafing against his knees, his elbows. He settles for kneeling, instead, as he tries in vain to shake the sand from his hair and clothes, wipe it from his skin. As the sun finally peeks over the mountains, he twists his head, looks over his shoulder. They buried him where he fell. In the early morning light, he can make out the shape of his own damaged wings seared onto the ground, stretching out on either side of where he lay. There is no cross marking his grave, no cairn, just a small circle of carefully placed rocks and a pair of familiar bootprints not yet washed away by the elements. Castiel turns back around. He rises slowly to his feet and stumbles into the house. Weiterlesen @phan-band-fandoms I need this for my sanity" False text

Based on the character’s repeated, emphasized disinterest in girls, Jughead has been the focal point of much speculation regarding his sexuality over the course of the comics’ eight decades of publication. As recently as last year, the characters was revealed to be canonically asexual. With the aging comics’ relevance revitalized via the CW’s Riverdale, many fans are wondering just how much the underrepresented sexuality (or rather, absence of) would be specifically emphasized. And there’s no greater advocate than the character’s actor himself. “I hope that huge corporations like the CW recognize that this kind of representation is rare and severely important to people who resonate with it,” Sprouse tells Teen Vogue, “That demands representation. It would be a wonderful thing if that were the case.” Sprouse does reveal that the first season of Riverdale will not directly touch on asexuality; however, he does call the show an origin story, where the characters will learn, grow, and discover who they are. In the meantime, Sprouse says he will “keep fighting for this pretty heavily.” Riverdale airs Thursdays at 9 on the CW. " False link

There were dozens of causes and concerns represented — reproductive choice, sexual violence, income inequality, Idle No More, trans rights, solidarity with immigrants and refugees, Black Lives Matter, environmental protection — but everyone seemed united in a common purpose. One of the speakers on the dias yelled out over the crowd of 60,000: “I have all the feminist feels!”The gathering included veteran activists and protest virgins; people of every background, gender and orientation. There was a large contingent of men and boys, but mostly it was women and girls, bright in pink hats and scarves, hopeful about the possibility of change, filling the grounds at Queen’s Park and spilling onto University Avenue.But it was two girls who weren’t present who were on my mind all day. Two girls who had recently passed away, gone, in part, because they’d lost their sense of hope. Jolynn Winter committed suicide on January 8, and two days later her friend Chantel Fox did the same. Both girls were just 12 years old and lived in Wapekeka First Nation, in northern Ontario. Wapekeka has a population of about 400 and the only access in or out is by plane. The nearest medical care centres are in Sioux Lookout and Thunder Bay — 450 km and 600 km away, respectively. Last summer, adults learned that a number of children had created a suicide pact and they immediately asked Health Canada to fund local suicide prevention services. The request was denied. It was an “awkward time” in the funding cycle, a rep at Health Canada said.The children didn’t get help and the problem didn’t go away. On Facebook, shortly before her death, Jolynn posted a status update that read: “Wake up, pretend I’m okay, sleep.” Since Jolynn and Chantel died, four other girls have been flown out of Wapekeka for psychological care. Another 26 children are still thought to be at a high risk for killing themselves.This is just the latest chapter in Wapekeka’s struggles. In the 1970s and ’80s, an Anglican minister and Boy Scout leader named Ralph Rowe sexually assaulted more than 500 indigenous boys in Northern Ontario, many from Wapekeka. Two years ago, the sole elementary school in Wapekeka burned down. There is no high school; in grade nine, children have to move away in order to get an education.The trauma of residential schools has been passed down through generations; schools and health care don’t get decent funding; languages have been lost; a succession of governments have been negligent or outright hostile. The conditions that set in motion the mental health crisis in Wapekeka can be seen in other First Nations all across Canada.Continue Reading." False link
