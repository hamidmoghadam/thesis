But look closer. It’s actually a map. In fact, the area around the butterfly’s body contains secret military information about the whereabouts of an enemy fortress. The drawing’s creator Robert Baden-Powell, in his 1915 book My Adventures as a Spy, wrote: “This sketch of a butterfly contains the outline of a fortress, and marks both the position and power of the guns. The marks on the wings between the lines mean nothing, but those on the lines show the nature and size of the guns, according to the keys below.” It was espionage by entomology.” - Atlas Obscura  " False text

He happens to pull up in front of the house in his car as this is going on and immediately floors the gas and tries to make a break for it…. A high speed chase ensues….  The feds chase the guy, he loses control of the car, takes out a telephone poll, a clothing donations box, an old ladies car, and smashes head on into a bus full of children! He’s ejected from the car by the impact, and witnesses report the guy is lying on the ground literally “holding his head together so his brains don’t fall out screaming in agony!” This bloody debacle is witnessed by the bus full of now traumatized school children…. As the news interviews people, they get the one guy that says, “Oh drugs are so bad. This shows you how dangerous the neighborhood has become. blah, blah, blah, blah!”  How hard is it to see that it’s not the drugs but the DRUG WAR! The “drug war” has caused more problems than the drugs could of ever created in the first place.  If they legalized drugs tomorrow, most people aren’t going to run out and buy crack cocaine, or heroin, just because they can. What would happen is that drug addicts would get pure drugs, not laced with FDA approved Fentanyl, drug overdoses would be substantially lowered, people could buy their drugs in a safe, non violent atmosphere, health issues would be minimized, drugs are no longer sold in the neighborhoods and purchased at pharmacies, and scenes like the above described, would rarely, if ever take place! WAKE THE FUCK UP PEOPLE! The drug war causes more problems than the drugs themselves could ever cause! The drug war is an epic failure, and it’s time to put an end to it. STOP THE INSANITY!"

As far as I knew, it was also completely ok to eat sushi with chopsticks if you can, just use them properly.  I believe they were only talking about not using chopsticks with nigiri, but other sushi is fine.  I don’t know how much of this is just satire so I don’t know how much of any of this to take seriously, but on the chopsticks and nigiri, why is it/would it okay to eat sushi with chopsticks except for nigiri?  I hear ya. ^^ A little humor to set the tone. A little light reading suggest sushi was traditionally eaten by hand though I’m certain it’s all good either way. Some purist may compare eating pizza with a fork, methinks. Supposedly, it’s just rude to rub the chopsticks in respect to the restaurant’s quality of their utensils. i.e. putting sauce or spices on food before tasting it in respects to the quality of the food. ^^ Other shindigs seem to just help savor the taste of such a benevolent delicacy.  I’m guilty of putting the soy sauce and wasabi on everything. When I lived in Las Vegas my sushi chef used to get so mad at me. Then he’d laugh and say, “White people put soy sauce on everything!“" False text

You have no right to tell artists to censor themselves - you may criticize what others do, you may dislike it, that’s fine - but actively asking for censorship when you could easily unfollow or block a person just makes you look incompetent in your use of the internet. 5.
