It actually means nothing of any significance at best and is sometimes even the more wasteful, more hazardous option. A shitload of “natural” food including a lot of imported produce is grown and harvested through slave labor in inhumane conditions. Pizza, fried chicken, french fries, fast food, candy bars and chips ARE nutritious. They are loaded with good things. Just because they have an abundance of excess fats and might not be healthy as a staple doesn’t mean they are “nutritionless” or that their calories are “empty.” Those are hokey buzzwords pushed by the people in charge of how much you pay for the alternatives. Eating healthier costs more. Much more. Looking down on people for their reliance on cheaper food is extremely classist and expecting everyone to be able to live off fresh veggies and cage-free meats is insultingly unrealistic in the modern world. “Processed” literally only means the food went through some kind of automated process. This can be literally the exact same thing a human being would have done to the food for it to be labeled “unprocessed.” Being processed does not make something less healthy.  Chemicals with long, scary names are part of nature. An apple is full of compounds you probably can’t pronounce. A shorter ingredients label only means they didn’t bother listing all 300 things the product is actually made of and HAS to be made of. Preservatives, artificial flavors and other additives are not the devil. Most are harmless and in general they are part of the reason you haven’t already starved to death or died of a food borne illness. MSG is not bad for you at all. The fact that something might be made of “scrap” meats like pig snouts or chicken necks only means one thing: that we didn’t waste perfectly normal, edible meat. I DON’T KNOW HOW I FORGOT THIS IN MY FIRST VERSION OF THIS POST BUT GMO’S ARE NOT DANGEROUS TO EAT. GMO’S ARE SAVING LIVES. YOU’VE ALREADY EATEN GMO’S BEFORE YOU EVEN KNEW THE TERM. IT’S FINE. EAT THEM.  I agree with everything except the msg one. People with chronic migraines really should not have MSG; it can give us terrible headaches.  MSG is a type of salt so it’s only as bad for you as any other salt. That is, only if you have certain conditions, or if you have way too much of it. " False text

Twelve-year-old Kara escaped the doomed planet Krypton with her parents’ help at the same time as the infant Kal-El. Protected and raised on Earth by her foster family, the Danvers, Kara grew up in the shadow of her foster sister, Alex (Chyler Leigh), and learned to conceal the phenomenal powers she shares with her famous cousin in order to keep her identity a secret. Years later, Kara was living in National City and still concealing her powers, when a plane crash threatened Alex’s life and Kara took to the sky to save her. Now, Kara balances her work as a reporter for CatCo Worldwide Media with her work for the Department of Extra-Normal Operations (DEO), a super-secret government organization whose mission is to keep National City – and the Earth – safe from sinister threats. At the DEO, Kara works for J’onn J’onzz (David Harewood), the Martian Manhunter, and alongside her sister, Alex, and best friend, Winn Schott (Jeremy Jordan). Also in Kara’s life are media mogul Cat Grant (Calista Flockhart), James Olsen (Mehcad Brooks), a photo journalist who moonlights as Guardian, a masked vigilante, Lena Luthor (Katie McGrath), and Mon-El of Daxam (Chris Wood), whose planet was ravaged by Krypton’s destruction. As Kara struggles to navigate her relationships and her burgeoning life as a reporter, her heart soars as she takes to the skies as Supergirl to fight crime. Based on characters created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, SUPERGIRL is from Berlanti Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television, with executive producers Greg Berlanti (“The Flash,” “Arrow”), Andrew Kreisberg (“The Flash,” “Arrow”), Sarah Schechter (“Arrow,” “The Flash”), Robert Rovner (“Private Practice,” “Dallas”) and Jessica Queller (“Gilmore Girls,” “Gossip Girl,” “Felicity”).

Below is her response in its entirety:  “Hi Adi,  Thank you for thinking of me. I’m glad you are a fan of my work so much that you want to provide more visibility for my career to inspire “other working women.” However, I’m for women who actually empower other women.  I don’t believe that IvankaTrump.com is truly “a non-political platform of empowerment for [women]”.

EW can exclusively reveal that the season finale will be titled “Nevertheless, She Persisted,” per executive producer Andrew Kreisberg. The title is inspired by Senator Elizabeth Warren’s refusal to be silenced during the debate to confirm Senator Jeff Sessions as Attorney General. Warren spoke out against him, reading a letter by Coretta Scott King, during which she was interrupted several times before a vote was called to effectively silence her. After the incident, Senator Mitch McConnell said, “Senator Warren was giving a lengthy speech. She had appeared to violate the rule. She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted.” Much more than just becoming a meme online, it became a rallying cry about women’s ability to break barriers if they persist, which seems apropos for what’s ahead for Supergirl (Melissa Benoist) in the finale. Not only is Daxamite Queen Rhea (Teri Hatcher) planning something nefarious in retaliation for losing her son, Mon-El (Chris Wood), but anti-alien group Cadmus is still lurking in the shadows, while Kryptonian villain Zod (Mark Gibbon) is also expected to appear. Good thing Kara will have extra help on hand with the returns of Superman (Tyler Hoechlin) and Cat Grant (Calista Flockhart) in the season ender! Supergirl airs Mondays at 8 p.m. ET on The CW. The finale will air May 22.  “Nevertheless, She Persisted?” Wow, it’s almost like the show is based on the strength of women. Never could’ve guessed by the way it’s been going lately. " False link

A series regular in season 1, Flockhart took on a recurring guest star role when production on the CW super series moved to Vancouver in season 2. The character exited in the second episode of the season, during which Cat declared it was time for her to move on — she had dominated the media world, but felt stagnant, so she took a leave of absence to conquer new challenges. She has not been seen since. Back in February, executive producer Andrew Kreisberg seemed optimistic that Flockhart would be back by season’s end. “We’re working on it,” Kreisberg said. “We love Calista, Calista loves us, she loves the show.

According to early reviews of the film, the character of Trini the Yellow Ranger, played by the pop star and actor Becky G, is revealed in one scene to be having “girlfriend problems”, a moment that the film’s director has described as “pivotal” in the film. “For Trini, really she’s questioning a lot about who she is,” Power Rangers director Dean Israelite told the Hollywood Reporter. “She hasn’t fully figured it out yet. I think what’s great about that scene and what that scene propels for the rest of the movie is, ‘That’s OK.’ The movie is saying, ‘That’s OK,’ and all of the kids have to own who they are and find their tribe.” LGBT superheroes have been a mainstay in comic books in recent years, with Wonder Woman, Batwoman and Iceman each appearing as gay or bisexual at some point during their runs. But depictions of LGBT superheroes have been largely absent from film. Marvel’s antihero Deadpool, who identifies as pansexual, was one recent prominent big-screen exception – although he wasn’t shown having a non-heterosexual experience in the film. The news about the Yellow Ranger comes shortly after Disney revealed that the character of LeFou in the live-action version of Beauty and the Beast is gay. The “exclusively gay moment”, as Beauty and the Beast director Bill Condon described it, received much attention in the build-up to the film’s release. Russian cinemas handed it an adults-only rating, and censors in Malaysia requested the scene be cut. Disney has refused to remove the scene and postponed the film’s Malaysian release date. The controversy has done little harm to Beauty and the Beast’s standing at the box office, where it enjoyed a record-breaking weekend across the globe. Power Rangers will be released on 24 March.
