THIS is puppet animation: the funniest part is that most puppet animation isn’t even done in flash anymore. people use after effects instead because it has MUCH more sophisticated and useful tools meant specifically for puppet animation. the technique can be used well, however. my little pony does it so fluidly it looks practically seamless. homestar runner doesn’t focus nearly as much on fluidity, but instead on constructing strong, expressive key poses and making every frame really count. puppet animation isn’t even limited to digital mediums. in fact, it’s not new at all. the adventures of prince achmed is the world’s oldest surviving feature-length animated film - that’s right, predating snow white by over 10 years - and it was done entirely using puppet animation; black paper cutouts atop illuminated backgrounds. and it’s truly fucking breathtaking.  Things I believe needed to be said. It’s not the technique or the tool, it’s what the artist does with it.  " False text
