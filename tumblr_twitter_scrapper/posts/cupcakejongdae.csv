I hope they wont act all cool just because that’s how western artist usually do. I want them to show their real self, all smiles, and show how much grateful they are for the awards. And we all know namjoon probably feels super nervous right now for the acceptance speech. I just hope he is not too nervous and even if he made a mistakes in english, its super okay because he sincerely learned the language and tried his best even tho its not his first language. And one more thing, I just hope all the fans not take namjoon’s effort to speak in english for granted cause he learned it to communicate with us, his fans." False text
