Only to find out they have needles inside and pierced her tongue] The fanartist in question is Avimedes, a Taiwanese fanartist who draws primarily for Undertale. On May 10th she posted on her Plurk (warning for images with blood, needles) that she was given cookies as a gift; she ate one and a needle pierced her tongue.  Here is a translation of her post:  Warning, these photos contain a lot of blood. I’m very sorry that I haven’t had a chance to say my thanks (for the convention?) and I am venting. But I received a needle in my dessert gift from the convention. Thank you, I have one more piercing now. I am not trying to ask for comfort, I am only trying to tell everyone how serious is this matter, so do not comfort me. This matter is unable to be investigated and hopeless to be investigated. This matter has made me lost of trust towards something, but from today onwards, I will not be accepting any more handmade food by others. Any more follow up and notice will be posted(if there’s any), thank you for your attention.  From discussion (Twitter, Reddit) it seems likely that she was given these cookies because she draws Sans/Frisk art, and a “fan” decided that drawing a ship they didn’t like was worthy of attempted murder. Had Avimedes swallowed the needle it could have done considerable and possibly irreparable internal damage.  So I will say this again: DO NOT HARM REAL PEOPLE OVER FICTIONAL ENTITIES. I don’t care what the content is. These purity crusades need to STOP. The amount of vitriol and anger that the anti-shipping circles not only accept but encourage is dangerous, unhealthy, and unless stopped will lead to more people being hurt. There’s already been at least one incident of an artist being harassed into a suicide attempt.  Your moral indignation/righteous anger/upset feelings DO NOT justify the injury or death of other people. You have every right to protect yourself from viewing objectionable content, but that right stops far, far short of hurting other people. Going on these crusades DOES NOT HELP against the sort of issues that are purportedly being championed; it only causes more harm. We need to break away from this mindset, from purity culture, before someone is permanently injured or dies.    FICTION =/= REALITYSTOP HURTING PEOPLE " False text

But pretend the raisins are interesting and well rounded fictional characters with significant roles in their stories.  We’re sharing these raisins at a party for Western Storytelling, so we get out two bowls.   Then we start filling the bowls. And at first we only fill the one on the left.   This doesn’t last forever though. Eventually we do start putting raisins in the bowl on the right. But for every raisin we put in the bowl on the right, we just keep adding to the bowl on the left.   And the thing about these bowls is, they don’t ever reset. We don’t get to empty them and start over. While we might lose some raisins to lost records or the stories becoming unpopular, but we never get to just restart. So even when we start putting raisins in the bowl on the right, we’re still way behind from the bowl on the left.  And time goes on and the bowl on the left gets raisins much faster than the bowl on the right.     Until these are the bowls.  Now you get to move and distribute more raisins. You can add raisins or take away raisins entirely, or you can move them from one bowl to the other.  This is the bowl on the left. I might have changed the number of raisins from one picture to the next. Can you tell me, did I add or remove raisins? How many? Did I leave the number the same?  You can’t tell for certain, can you? Adding or removing a raisin over here doesn’t seem to make much of a change to this bowl.  This is the bowl on the right. I might have changed the number of raisins from one picture to the next. Can you tell me, did I add or remove raisins? How many? Did I leave the number the same?  When there are so few raisins to start, any change made is really easy to spot, and makes a really significant difference.  This is why it is bad, even despicable, to take a character who was originally a character of color and make them white. But why it can be positive to take a character who was originally white and make them a character of color. The white characters bowl is already so full that any change in number is almost meaningless (and is bound to be undone in mere minutes anyway, with the amount of new story creation going on), while the characters of color bowl changes hugely with each addition or subtraction, and any subtraction is a major loss.  This is also something to take in consideration when creating new characters. When you create a white character you have already, by the context of the larger culture, created a character with at least one feature that is not going to make a difference to the narratives at large. But every time you create a new character of color, you are changing something in our world.  I mean, imagine your party guests arrive  Oh my god they are adorable! And they see their bowls  But before you hand them out you look right into the little black girls’s eyes and take two of her seven raisins and put them in the little white girl’s bowl. I think she’d be totally justified in crying or leaving and yelling at you. Because how could you do that to a little girl? You were already giving the white girl so much more, and her so little, why would you do that? How could you justify yourself? But on the other hand if you took two raisins from the white girl’s bowl and moved them over to the black girl’s bowl and the white girl looked at her bowl still full to the brim and decided your moving those raisins was unfair and she stomped and cried and yelled, well then she is a spoiled and entitled brat.  And if you are adding new raisins, it seems more important to add them to the bowl on the right. I mean, even if we added the both bowls at the same speed from now on (and we don’t) it would still take a long time before the numbers got big enough to make the difference we’ve already established insignificant.  And that’s the difference between whitewashing POC characters and making previously white characters POC. And that’s why every time a character’s race is ambiguous and we make them white, we’ve lost an opportunity. *goes off to eat her chocolate covered raisins, which are no longer metaphors just snacks*  Because given recent events, THIS CLEARLY FUCKING NEEDS TO BE SAID AGAIN.  It’s back! *REBLOGS AND QUEUES*  Holy shit this is brilliant. " False text

What I’ve SEEN is people asking the question: if someone starts to RP in this game tomorrow and asks what server to roll on, what the hell do we tell them? I think as a community we need to have care for people just arriving, and ensure they have somewhere to go. THAT’S why I’m invested in seeing a genuine alternative arise, despite the fact I have zero intention of transferring away myself.  This. This is the reason. Literally. We need to help those who cannot reach us. We are more than just Balmung, we a community grouping of the entire game. It’s about time we opened our eyes and started caring for more than what is at our feet.   I’d probably start alts somewhere else since I have no FC and no friend group on Balmung. I wouldn’t transfer my mains off because I do have a few friends, but my point is, I have zero attachment to the Balmung RP community and wouldn’t mind seeing another fresh group of people start a thriving community. I know it’s an unpopular opinion, but I personally find the community to be very saturated as it is and I’m kind of just wanting a fresh start, with new RPers, new groups of people, with new ideas.  Same honestly. Aside from my wife (and she only plays very rarely) I don’t have any friends or an FC on Balmung. I attend events but I don’t have a dedicated group to RP plot and character growth with as most have already established groups, and for quite some time. I’d be down to joining new RPers on a low pop server - so deciding where they will all congregate is really important for the community so we can keep from getting to dispersed." False text
