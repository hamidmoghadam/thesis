They’re like, “We’ve waited so long for this.”JACK: Any sort of tweet that we do or any social media thing, it’s always like — [looking through Twitter on his phone] — trying to find a good example I saw earlier. They’re always incredibly offensive, like “F–king sluts, where’s ‘Disconnect’? F–k you!” Let’s put the fans at ease: Is “Disconnect” a song that’s possibly going to end up on your second album?G: Yeah, yeah. That is a really special song for us.JACK:  [Still reading tweets] Like, “You dusty-ass possum! Please ‘Disconnect’.” What does that even mean?GRACE:  I don’t know.JACK:  We put that photo [online] of Luke nominated for this award, and that’s a comment on there.GRACE: That song with Marina And The Diamonds is a really special song for us, but since we performed it live at Coachella we’ve been trying out different directions for the production. Now we’re kind of thinking we might go back to the original, so there was no need for anyone to wait two years!JACK: It’s like maybe 30 different versions of it on my laptop. I think we’ve finished one, actually — I was working on it on the way [to New York] on the plane, so I think we’re going to have a nice surprise for them soon.  (Source) " False text

Like they’re acting so goofy, like she’s killing her career or something. How artists out there don’t actually meet their fans? This isn’t anything new? And if she’s tired after shows, she’s tired. And if people were abusing the MarinaMeets privileges then Marina wasn’t completely in the wrong for stopping it.  I didn’t have a chance to even try to get chosen for a MarinaMeets thing because she’s not coming back to Indy anytime soon. So I’m a lil upset too, but the way some of y'all are acting is so obnoxious omg.  Knowing Marina she’s probably gonna address sometime soon, so chill the hell out please. Y'all are still gonna support her, buy her music, and call her fucking Madre like get over it.  The way some fans act regarding this MarinaMeets mess is honestly reprehensible. People will drag her, leave petty comments on her Instagram pics, blame her for something a fan allegedly did and just act like Marina is actually responsible for the good behavior of her entire fanbase. Then they act like she’s not allowed to be disappointed and/or angry at the way she’s treated by the very same people who claim to love her. It’s heartbreaking that the respectful and supportive fans lost the opportunity to meet her because others think they’re entitled to Marina’s personhood. She deserves better than to have to deal with disrespectful, self-centered “fans” " False text

Pre-sale goes live on Wednesday (September 16); general sale goes live on Friday (September 18). The Neon Nature Tour shows will be split up into three acts: Act I (The Family Jewels), Act II (Electra Heart), and Act III (Froot). Each act will feature visuals from the corresponding eras and Marina will be playing her favorite songs from each era. Marina has decided against a Froot repackage, which she initially considered because she had a new song called “I’m Not Hungry Anymore.” Marina may still release “Hungry,” although she isn’t satisfied with it yet. Meet and greets for the Neon Nature Tour will work as follows: Marina’s management will randomly select 20 people to meet Marina before the show. The meet and greets will be free. In the next few weeks, Marina will be posting images of what the Neon Nature Tour stage will look like. Also, in the beginning of October, Marina will release a lookbook for all the stage outfits she will be using for the tour. “Disconnect,” Marina’s collaboration with Clean Bandit, will be released some time in 2016. There is new Neon Nature Tour merch available, which will be available at all shows and will be made available for purchase online in December. Vinyls of The Family Jewels and Electra Heart will be made available on October 30th. Pre-order will be available tomorrow (September 15). " False text
