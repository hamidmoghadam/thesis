Fucking amazing.  We got to know a lot more of Jack’s backstory, many old friends and objects returned, the CGI was amazing, the story was well written, the after credits scene was really cool. It was full of little jokes but it was still shocking and sometimes sad, so the usual PoTC atmosphere. It didn’t seem forced at all. It had the cliché heteromance™ because which one doesn’t, but it was awesome even tho it was the 5th episode, and many movies don’t even succeed at making an enjoyable 2nd , let alone a 5th, but this sure did. 10/10 would recommend!"

Wow. I can honestly say that is the best movie I have seen in a long time, if not, ever. It was also the funniest. Oh my god I’m so emotional about it. If you’ve kept up with the series, even if you didn’t watch the 4th one, definitely go see this one. Not only will you love it, but the better the movie does in box office, the sooner they’ll get a sequel out there (which is already on IMBD and has a 2019/2020 rumored release date). If you haven’t kept up with the series but you want to see this you need to watch the first three at least because you will be so confused if you don’t (and helllo the first three are AMAZING) so yeah go see it I’m not going to spoiler anything but if you’ve kept up with the movies there are some BIG twists coming. And DONT forget to stay for the after credits scene.  tl;dr Go see Pirates of the Caribbean 5 it was so good watch the first three if you haven’t or you’ll be confused and don’t forget to stay for the after credits scene.

There, he set-up a “Colonel Kurtz-like compound of guns, sex and madness,” according to a statement. In the film, a Wired magazine investigator “accepts what he thinks is a run-of-the-mill assignment to interview McAfee, but once he arrives in Belize, he finds himself pulled into McAfee’s escalating paranoia, slippery reality, and murder.” " False link
