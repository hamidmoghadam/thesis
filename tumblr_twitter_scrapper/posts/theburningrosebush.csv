Ochre, an iron-rich rock characterized by a red or yellow color, is found at many Middle Stone Age sites. The largest known East African collection of Middle Stone Age ochre, found at Porc-Epic Cave in Ethiopia, weighs around 40kg and is thought to date to ca. 40,000 years ago. The authors of the present study conducted a detailed analysis of 3792 pieces of ochre, using microscopy and experimental reproduction of grinding techniques to assess how the ochre was processed and used over a 4,500-year timespan.

And what ended up happening as a  result was the internet had been completely shut down, world wide. The  gaming industry had also been wiped out. All the giants, Nintendo, Sony,  Microsoft, Capcom, EA, everything, bankrupt and gone. The comic and  book industries were also gone. Toast. Marvel, DC, even goliaths like  Archie went under within months. Total, catastrophic collapse of all of  the big arts and creative media industries all over the word. Each week,  there was news of SJWs destroying another big company and the industry  around it crumbling. All that was left of our beloved hobbies was the  indies. Small groups of those of us who truly love our craft and would  willingly go through hell to share our love with others.The  dream opened up with me trying to build one of these groups. Without the  aid of the internet, it was getting really hard for indie groups to  start forming. But that was the basis of the dream. Everything artistic  was gone, and it was up to us to pull together to rebuild our hobbies.  Comic groups were being created, game dev groups were forming, writers  were getting a hold of typewriters and forming indie writing clans, amateur film, etc.  It was like a post apocalyptic world, but with art and media, and we  had to work to rebuild the world by rebuilding creative expression, and a  new culture that would allow things to go back to how they used to be.  Where people got to express what they wanted without fear of feminist  CEOs and executives. Which was hard to do, because of the new  authoritarian feminist government monitoring phone calls for incorrect  language and wrongthink.It was kind of cool, an underground  rebellion by creativity and artistic freedom, but it was also scary,  because the world had gone to hell, and Islam had taken over, leaving  only small societies of people willing to fight in our own way.I’ll say it again, I’m really glad for GamerGate.

The venture capitalist asks what the act is and they  reply: “A new block of transactions is created every ten minutes or so, with  12.5 bitcoins (BTC) reward (plus any fees on the transactions) attached.  Bitcoin miners apply as much brute-force computing power as they can to  take the prize in this block’s cryptographic lottery. Unprocessed  transactions are broadcast across the Bitcoin network. A miner collects  together a block of transactions and the hash of the last known block.  They add a random ‘nonce’ value, then calculate the hash of the  resulting block. If that number is lower than the current mining  difficulty, they have mined a block! This successful block is then  broadcast to the network, who can quickly check the block is valid. They  get 12.5 BTC plus the transaction fees. If they failed, they pick  another nonce value and try again. Since it’s extremely hard to pick  what data will have a particular hash, guessing what value will give a  valid block takes many calculations – as of October 2016 the Bitcoin  network was running 1,900,000,000,000,000,000 (1.9x10^18, or 1.9  quintillion) hashes per second, or 1.14 x 10^21 (1.14 sextillion) per  ten minutes. The difficulty is adjusted every two weeks (2016 blocks) to  keep the rate of solved blocks around one every ten minutes. The 1.14  sextillion calculations are thrown away, because the only point of all  this is to show that you can waste electricity faster than everyone  else.” The venture capitalist says: “Holy shit, that’s the worst idea I’ve ever  heard!

Recognize this so you can be in a better position to stand your ground and ensure your wellbeing   Tips: 1)NEVER give a customer your real name,location, the name of your university (regardless of how prestigious it is, if the customer is an alumnus, or if they attend the school. I don’t care. Don’t do it) 2) Don’t give customers your actual number. It’s far too easy to reverse search people via numbers. Get a trap phone or a google voice number  3) Always have your phone on. Better yet, download the Life360 app so your loved ones can keep track of your location  4)Diversify your routes back home and monitors the car behind you 5) Have a male employee escort you to your car and park your car at a well lit parking space 6) Keep an eye on your drinks. I always bring my drinks with me to my stage sets. If you have to go up to leave momentarily, bring your drink along with you. 7) get a can of pepper spray.  8)never stop at any restaurants or business within a mile radius of work coming to or leaving your shift  9)If you’re in an uncomfortable situation with a customer at VIP, feel free to leave even before the times up and tell management about the customer  10)don’t let anyone treat you badly or violate your comfort zone, regardless of whether or not you’re being paid to spend time with them. You’re not working a regular 9-5 so you’re not obligated to follow the “customer is always right” line of reasoning. When it comes to your comfort, never give a customer an inch; he’ll always take a mile  11) if you’re faced with a circumstance in which you have even the smallest bit of apprehension, don’t follow through with it.

I don’t woo with these, though there are many fine uses for them in several magical paths. I use these to get rid of bugs. Specifically fleas, though there is evidence that it works on bedbugs too. The brand I buy (from a metaphysical shop, which never ceases to amuse me) is Deer brand, which is a decent enough brand for my uses. If you are doing anything but chasing away bugs, go for a better brand. Camphor is toxic when eaten. Especially the suspicious probably-mostly-chemicals kind like Deer brand. So, depending on the pets/small children involved, you need the smell to permeate your home (and it will, this shit is strong) without having it where small folks will eat it. IF YOU HAVE BIRDS I WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST RESEARCHING INTO TOXICITY FOR THEM. THEY CAN BE DELICATE, AND BETTER FLEAS THAN A DEAD FEATHERED FRIEND. DO NOT dissolve it in water and spray; baaaad idea. I have the joy and curse of non-working floor vents in my home, so I drop a tablet down them wholesale. My cat can’t reach it and if any rodents find it they’re welcome to have a bite. My folk’s house doesn’t have vents at all. Over there, we take orphan socks and put a tablet in the toe, knot it, then shove it as deep in the couch and recliner as it will go. The dogs don’t like the smell and leave them well enough alone. You can tuck one under beds or dressers, in the bottom of cabinets- anywhere a sock can safely hide. Now, this method does not kill them. It merely drives the fleas away. We recently sock-bombed my folk’s house, so the fleas have been fleeing for safer ground. In this case- my house, which is why I went and bought more blocks to prevent a decent foothold getting established here. Deer brand doesn’t store for long here. They dissolve over time into powder. So blocks may need to be replaced, depending on how long it takes them to repel your bugs. If you’re in an apartment building, do your whole apartment all at once if possible. And while the camphor is repelling invaders, deal with the source of the issue- hopefully, your own animals. Bathe them, flea-powder them, whatever. If your infestation is bleedover from a neighbor, do your area and keep a regular outpost of camphor closest to the source. If you’re in a house, I would probably consider doing the whole shebang if possible. If not, place camphor around the non-infested zone, then work your way across the infested area. Be prepared for the fleas to cling to clothing and try to make it past the blocks. This stuff is not a forcefield, but over the course of a couple days you will see drastic reduction in fleas, if your infestation was anything like mine. When I had a bad infestation of fleas that made it into the closet we keep our clothes in, the blocks got rid of them. Bedding? clear. Kitchen floor? clear. I went from killing 20+ fleas a hour to maybe 5 to nothing in 2 days. I also had the clearest sinuses in the county. You have to be able to stand some serious sniffy stuff to use this method, but it does work.  A small note: even in small doses, camphor can cause tachycardia. It may be psychoactive, as well, even when enhaled. It was used as an early treatment for melancholia, although its toxicity and tendency to cause seizures in large doses lead to other treatments being sought out. So, also avoid camphor if you have epilepsy, probably.   I just use essential oils for that sort of thing." False text

I had no idea. It was first used, no joke, in the 1700s for that purpose. I also remembered that it was used in “twilight sleep” treatments: German and Russian doctors would combine camphor and henbane (scopolamine) and give it to pregnant women, before the treatment reached the states. In the U.S. we combined scopolamine and morphine. Unfortunately, scopolamine is very hallucinogenic, and “twilight sleep” treatments were horrible for the women that endured it while giving birth.   On a personal note, I always hated the smell of camphor."

But the implications of belief of this on a large scale are…not good.  i recently heard an interview with a guy who wrote this book “the geography of genius” and all the while the interviewer was like “well what is genius?” and it’s so obvious that, to the author anyway, genius is male. the book is about centers of thought and innovation throughout history (greece, scotland, silicon valley, hangzhou) and who/why “genius” is concentrated in certain physical spaces and times. i think his definition is ALSO very white, though he seems to have taken steps to at least appear as though he thought about non-white genius. his “genius centers” or whatever outside of europe are pretty lacking. calcutta and hangzhou are the only two non-western centers he talks about. aside from the fact that his “research” seems more like excuses to travel somewhere (which, full disclosure, i would totally take advantage of if i could), it’s so glaring and obvious throughout the interview and presumably throughout the book that i will definitely not read, he only mentions men. like, exclusively. and it’s such a huge disappointment although completely non surprising. he opened the interview by saying genius is not just IQ, it’s like, everyone around you has to recognize that spark or special something, the x factor. and at the beginning i was like oh boy this is gonna be interesting! let’s talk about how social perceptions of genius are affected by racism and misogyny!  and he didn’t go there, not even a little bit. he was mostly interested in white guys drinking whiskey or coffee and being extremely smart and deep and alluring. yawn " False text

[…] Our ancestors in healing, the long-ago plant people, were in service to their human community as well as the medicine allies they harvested from the hedges.  These plant people often lived on the edge of town and worked as not only healers of physical sickness, but also practitioners of spirit, shamans of the village soul, and knowers of, or in old English ‘cunners’ of, the ‘wort’, or herb. Some were called wortcunners. Some were called magicians. Some were called witches. There are many different types of herbalists now and in the past. In ancient times — interestingly! — they were called the rhizomati, or by some sources, rhizotomoki, meaning ‘root gatherers’ or ‘root cutters’.The rhizomati were rhizomatic practitioners of underground and lateral energy patterns as found in the plant kingdom.  According to Christian Rätsch, ‘the rhizotomoki still spoke with the plant spirits…’ He adds: ‘These root-gatherers observed the gods sacred to the respective plant. They made use of the moon’s energy and knew the particular oath formulas for each plant. Witchcraft medicine belongs to the spiritual and cultural legacy of the rhizotomoki.’Rätsch asserts, therefore, that ‘witchcraft medicine is wild medicine. It is uncontrollable, it surpasses the ruling order, it is anarchy. It belongs to the wilderness.’²  Anarchy and wildness, in this sense, are not instances of chaos, mayhem, or lack of a system; rather, it is a system that is self-organised, organic, self-regulated, and impervious to oppressive external control mechanisms.The rhizomati were carriers of traditional healing knowledge and have emerged at various points in time. In fact, as would a rhizome — going underground for a time and sprouting their legacy up to the surface in another place or time. Renowned modern-day herbalist David Hoffman has compared herbalists of our time to the Greek ‘rhizotomoi’ who held a very special place in the hierarchy of health-care practitioners during ancient times. He asserts that, now as then, herbal healers ‘breach so many realms.’""   " False link

This architecture, anchored by racism, classism and placeism (discrimination on the basis of neighbourhood), fosters ill health in the most marginalized and vulnerable groups, such as poor black people in urban areas and rural working-class white people. For the most unfortunate, such assaults on health status shave away decades of life. As Ansell shows, there is as much as a 35-year difference in life expectancy between the healthiest and richest US neighbourhoods and the most ill and deprived.  " False link

The poor already feel humiliated by life circumstances. I know because I looked into my mother’s eyes, and into the eyes of hundreds of other disenfranchised Americans who have real economic needs for themselves, and their children.  Poor people who refuse that shame and poor people who value other poor people and name and resist those social institutions reap a lot of punishment and stigma.  Poor people who don’t behave apologetically or ashamed enough are treated as particularly immoral and dangerous.

Migrants are, in fact, human beings who are just as capable as anyone else as getting pissed off at bad pay and crappy conditions and fighting to change them. While the TUC leadership seems capable mainly of organising symbolic marches, and Labour MPs give navel-gazing speeches about how to placate racists, migrants are fighting the battles that are defining the British workplace. Migrants are not a threat to British workers, but they are a threat to the government. They’re also showing British workers’ useless representatives up. They don’t deserve to be sold out by the left. If anything, an ungrateful left doesn’t deserve immigrants.  i’m going to reblog this every time one of the shitmunchers in the labour party / soft ‘left’ talks shit about immigration.  British workers should check the most succesful Dutch strikes of the last decade, particularily the Cleaners Strike. Workers rights were won specifically by organizing with migrant workers, putting migrants in leadership positions in the strike, recruiting a LOT of translaters, printing all material in multiple languages, etc. Organizing together is how you fucking win.

A number of years ago, I accidentally OD’ed on lorazepam. I’d been prescribed it for anxiety, at the same time as I was prescribed a number of other drugs including venlafaxine (an SNRI, brand name Effexor) and olanzapine (an anti-psychotic, marketed as Zyprexa). I was also stepping down doses of imipramine, a tricyclic anti-depressant. I’d been diagnosed as bipolar (type 1, your classical manic depressive). I’ve never met an SSRI or SNRI that I didn’t react badly to, and venlafaxine was no exception. In conjunction with all the other drugs, I was having one hell of a bad time, and I had a really bad interaction between all the drugs. The net effect was a perpetual ongoing panic attack. It was pretty damned horrible. The lorazepam was prescribed as a way to counteract the panic attacks. So I started taking it. And as the panic attack continued, I kept taking it. It seemed to make sense. I was having a panic attack, the lorazepam was meant to stop the panic attacks, so I figured if I kept taking it the panic attack would stop. So I accidentally OD’ed. Unlike Chris Cornell, I had people close to me who spotted something was wrong. @reddragdiva phoned me at one point and my responses were slurred and incoherent - much as Chris Cornell’s to his wife were. I was living with my ex-husband, our kids and his wife at the time as their lodger, and Diva badgered them on the phone. Jude, my ex’s wife, checked on me and took me straight to hospital. I got lucky. I lived. Chris Cornell didn’t. That’s the only difference between us, and dear gods do I feel for his wife and friends. He shouldn’t have died. It was an accident. And it could have been me. " False link

An expert in Mesoamerica, the evolution of complex societies, political economy and cultural ecology and armed with a voracious curiosity, Pool began his fieldwork at the Olmec site of Tres Zapotes, Mexico, in 1995, some 140 years after a farmworker’s hoe first scraped the top of a buried stone head. After numerous stone monuments were unearthed at Tres Zapotes, additional evidence of a highly sophisticated ancient culture was discovered. Archaeologists were lured away from Tres Zapotes by the discovery of the remains of several other ancient cities nearby and the tantalizing theory that the region was home to an early nation held together by a centralized monarchy. “Tres Zapotes had been abandoned as an active site when I arrived; it had been nearly 20 years since the most recent archaeological excavation of the area,” said Pool. Although huge prehistoric sculptures were fascinating, Pool was interested in learning something beyond the surface others saw and recorded. He wanted to learn how the citizens of Tres Zapotes lived their daily lives. How big was the city? How was it organized? Was there any connection with other ancient cities located nearby at San Lorenzo and La Venta? Did the nearby cities share in commerce, in politics, in beliefs? Pool worked in Tres Zapotes six or seven years before he started “thinking differently” about the site. While he agreed with other experts that it appeared that most of the Olmec society had a strong, centralized rulership, he suspected Tres Zapotes was idiosyncratic, even unique among the other Olmec cities. “Tres Zapotes is an unusually long-lived site, for one thing,” Pool said. “There is evidence that Tres Zapotes was a thriving community for nearly 2,000 years,” while the other Olmec cities with individualized rulership flourished as regional capitals for no more than 500 years or so. “We now believe that the citizens of Tres Zapotes may have shared the power, not among each individual in that society—as in a democracy, but at least among several different factions within the city. It appears that Tres Zapotes may have survived centuries after other Olmec capitals collapsed because its cooperatve government allowed it to adjust to changing times, to survive,” said Pool. Pool’s study of Tres Zapotes is chronicled in the March/April issue of Archaeology, a publication of the Archaeological Institute of America, and the March 17 issue of Science. " False link
