The text will look different in the new environment so your brain stops skipping what looks familiar (like a typo that has been there since the beginning).  So, tip: revise your work in a different font and size. I guarantee you’ll catch more typos and mistakes than otherwise.  For all my writers (ones I follow and the ones that thankfully follow me)  also it helps if you shift it into a font that’s a bit more complex and harder to read, like a fancy serif font, because it requires more processing power from the brain and you therefore focus more on what you’re reading and spot more mistakes.  Also, if you wait even as little as a day, though two or three is preferable, you’ll see a lot more of the errors. You can’t be immediately familiar with it; if you’re memory isn’t fresh then you’ll have to read more carefully. I’ve found that to be especially helpful for adjusting awkward phrasing and weird sentences or dialogue, rather than just the usual typos.  " False text

The stereotype is more than just irksome to me; it’s damaging. It disregards the ugly realities of racism throughout the country, particularly towards Aboriginal people.  I have witnessed way too much racism in this country to find the “nice Canadian” stereotype cute. The number of missing and murdered Aboriginal women and girls in my city alone is horrifying. The abuse and flat-out hatred is grotesque.  Here in Canada, people are really good at not giving a shit about the well-being of another human being if that person happens to be Aboriginal. Here in Canada, people are so well-armed with their assumptions and stereotypes that they can’t even bother to see Aboriginal people as HUMAN.  So no. Canada is not a magical land where everyone loves each other and says sorry constantly. That stereotype is insulting to every Aboriginal woman who is assaulted, goes missing, and/or is murdered. It’s insulting to the families of those missing and murdered women who seek justice and answers that they will never receive, simply because non-Aboriginal Canadians don’t give a damn.  Hey guys this is really important. Missing and murdered Indigenous Women and Girls is an actual problem, and it’s a huge problem here in Canada " False text

If you would have never gotten it then why would you degrade her for doing cute and interesting to a dress that probably would have just sat at the thrift store forever.  Hey you know what’s actually degrading? Making a habit, and by that I mean an entire blog, where you buy all the plus size clothes in a thrift store and then take pictures of yourself contrasting your tiny body against the IMPLLLAAAUSIBLY OUTRAGEOUSLY HUUUUGE clothing. That is degrading.  Also like, fat people live everywhere SOMEONE would have gone to that specific store and fit into those dresses as is and loved them, there are so little options for fat people everywhere, none of the alterations they made are special or unique, like they could easily find something similar in a thrift store at the same price point.  plus size clothes DON’T sit at the thrift store forever. general size clothes do. our donated clothes last maybe a few weeks tops at a thrift store because there’s a larger demand for them than supply, that’s why the sections are so damn small despite the average us woman being a size 14, because they’re picked over constantly by people who need clothes. i was not expecting to do this but i’m gonna go into deep detail so you understand why exactly this is fucked up. poor people are more likely to be plus size because of lack of access to healthy food, which is the target demographic of a damn thrift store in the first place. thrift shopping is trendy now, which is fine, except when you buy clothes for projects like this that are in high demand but low supply: maternity clothes, plus size clothes, pajamas, etc. if you need clothing, buy it. but you can make any of these projects from clothes without poaching from low supply areas and taking comical pictures that mock fat bodies. now here’s why there’s a ridiculously low supply of plus size clothes: fat people don’t have as many places to buy clothes and all of them have poor selection so we don’t buy a lot of them to begin with. the shopping pattern of a plus size person is very different from that of a straight size person as well. i know this from working in plus size retail. overwhelmingly, we shop when we desperately need clothes. and i mean desperately like hole the size of a basketball in the thigh of your jeans desperately. wearing a bra from 1998 desperately. work blazer held together with scotch tape and safety pins desperately. we can’t donate our clothes because we wear them until the point where we physically cannot anymore. we also don’t cycle through trends as much as smaller sizes because a) shopping is a huge ordeal for a plus size person and b) our clothes cost WAY MORE so we can’t afford to wear an article of clothing once and then give it to goodwill. then on top of that none of the places that give you money for clothes EVER want your fatass clothes. skinny people can pop over to any secondhand clothing store that pays for donations and get some of that investment back. we can’t do that EVEN THOUGH our clothes cost way more than straight sizes. oh, and we get paid less than thinner women btw :) that’s always great. so if we can’t regain any of our investment, we’re just gonna put up with clothes we don’t like until we can’t wear them anymore or we give them away in the case of weight loss (when ur fat you know a lot of other fatties, and if ur a queer/trans fatty someone is always having a clothing swap you can give to). all of this adds up to make it so that thrift stores are in low supply of plus size clothes that more and more people need because us fatties? if we don’t look good we don’t get jobs. you cannot look even the slightest bit unkempt or you come off as lazy or bitchy, and if you have a family to support you can’t spend weeks looking for a job where they won’t judge your competence based upon whether your clothes are trendy or not. when you’re not plus size and you take away these clothes from needy women you are in small part enabling their suffering. it shouldn’t be that way. women should have access to affordable, well fitting, professional clothing regardless of size. but that’s not the world we live in so you can’t just cover your ears and pretend that it is.  @a-lames-adventure please fucking read all the replies on this and get the fuck @ me  Perspective.  I understand both sides of this issue, but the majority of the replies are the ethically sound side.  Having gone from a size 4 to a size 14 due to weight gain from medication, I can tell you that there is absolutely NO NEED to destroy plus-size clothing in order to get cute cocktail dresses or whatever in a thrift store. There are TONS of adorable petite cocktail dresses, formal dresses, etc, for smaller women. And there is a huge lack of cute dresses for anyone larger than a 10. I’m not even considered ‘plus size’, and I still struggle to find dresses that don’t make me look like the Goodyear blimp, because I’m pretty sure designers give up once you get beyond a certain size and intentionally make the dresses as ugly as possible.  If you want to make your own dress, buy the fucking fabric and do it from a pattern. You can even make it from a ~*~vintage~*~ pattern if you want extra Twee Points. Don’t buy, cut up, and ruin a perfectly good plus-size dress, while taking mocking pictures of how OMGHUGE it is, in order to make a rather bland cocktail dress. There’s literally no need to do that other than that you’re unimaginative, selfish, and don’t care about plus-size women.  This time x1000Do you know how infuriating it is to try and find maternity clothes at a thrift store, find nothing, have to rely on you mom to spend $200 for 5 fucking items, and then go on pintrest and see some girl who would fit 90% of the clothes at the thrift store cutting up a maternity dress to make a blouse that looks like one you can by at urban Forever 21?

Buy nothing else. Buy Always Infinite with Flexfoam. This sexy beast. There’s a bunch of versions. But so long as it says Infinity and Flexfoam, fucking GET IT. So I’ve always been a fan of Always pads. Can’t stand tampons because of all the horror stories and in general, they’re uncomfortable. Always just seems to be the brand that’s always there so we always got it. Every since Always released their Infinity brand, we’ve literally hated everything else. Even the regular versions of Always. Infinity is the way to go. It is the ONLY way to go. Infinity is like the only way we can keep our damn bedsheets and clothes bloodless. The first night I got my period I woke up with my boxers just soaked. Completely soaked. Blood. Everywhere.  So I just pop into the bathroom and thus far we’ve only got regular Always pads. Put one on. It’s about as miserable as you’d expect. The pad shifts as you sit and move and when you change pads you’re probably changing underwear too because of the blood just seeping out the sides and getting everywhere. But then we have Always Infinity. With the Flexfoam. You know that bullshit on the side of the box brands spew where they’re like THIS SUPER INGENIOUS INVENTION WITH A FANCY NAME IS GOING TO GIVE YOU PRISTINE CLEANLINESS AND ULTIMATE PROTECTION AND THATS WHY WE USE FLEXFOAM. They’re not fucking kidding guys. This isn’t a fucking game. These pads are relentless. No blood gets by. You’d probably have to unhygenically use one pad 24 hours+ before the blood will actually leave the pad and get anywhere.  In addition to that? It’s invisible.  Okay look, guys. I’m trans. I’m a transman. I’m a fucking dude. I don’t suffer from dysphoria but nothing annoys and irritates me more than knowing I am wearing a fucking diaper because I can feel it everytime I move and stand and sit down. Not these bitches. No fucking way. They’re thin, they’re super big and they’re completely inmovable. I don’t have to keep grabbing at my crotch or my ass to readjust the pad lest blood be splashing everywhere. It stays in one fucking place and it doesn’t leave until you rip it out yourself.  THIS SHIT IS SO NICE. GO GET YOURSELF SOME. PLEASE SAVE YOURSELVES. SAVE YOUR UNDERWEAR. SAVE YOUR QUILTS. SAVE YOUR BED. HERE’S SOME COUPONS.  Rebloggin’ by request of the moum  I can say the same. These things are the shit and its beautiful. Whoever figured it out how to make them I’d very much like to thank, and I’m pretty sure my underwear would too.  A long time ago I read that Always pads make ur hingy itch but this person seems to really like them so I guess that problem was fixed. The thing i read was at least a year ago, probably more.  HOLY SHIT YOU GUYS when I was in Toronto (one night in a nice hotel downtown and of course  I got my fucking period) and the mini mart had these on sale so I took the risk and THESE ARE INCREDIBLE THIN! No leaks! No blood down the ass crack! FLEX FOAM FOR LIFE!!  Always Infinity and Always Radiant are the same exact product. Both have the flex foam but Radiant just has a fragrance to it + more colorful packaging. When one is on sale, the other one generally isn’t so buy the one on sale! Also, once you finish, the boxes can have coupons on the inside so use those on your next purchase!  You had me at no blood down the ass crack.  I can confirm how lovely these are and i refuse to use anything else over these  These are incredible. I HATE pads. Hate them. I only started using them because endo made it impossible for me to use tampons. My periods were miserable when I had to switch. Then I found flexfoam. My periods have completely changed. I can barely tell it’s there. No more diaper feeling. No more blood escaping. And seriously, my periods get really heavy at points and the foam absorbs it all.  THESE SHITS ARE MY FUCKING SAVIOR. YOU FORGET YOU’RE EVEN ON YOUR PERIOD, IT’S AMAZING LISTEN TO THIS POST.  👆🏾Literally Will Forget You’re r On Your Period They Are Super Comfy And Shit  I so second this for all the people who have periods  I use these all the time now. Sometimes I forget it’s on and panic a bit and then I have to go verify that there is, in fact, a pad there. No really, they’re that good.  " False text

Yeah. About that: The rabbi’s voice began to break. For several seconds, the park was silent, save for the sound of Roston sniffling. “You let us know that we are not alone,” she finally said. “You let us know that our community, that our amazing magnificent town of Whitefish, is not only protected by great, divinely formed mountains of earth — this town is protected by a wall of humanity that refuses to be quiet or sit still in the face of bigotry, racism, sexism, homophobia or anti-Semitism.” TL;DR – the entire town rallied around their neighbors. They got unequivocal, strong, bipartisan support from state officials. Reinforcements arrived from around the country. And the nazis fucking bailed. They never even showed up.

Now, if I  got that phone call, the answer would be yes.” He then recalled the story of “Amy,” a 15-year-old girl from Oakland,  Calif., who was forced into trafficking within hours of meeting a man  in person she’d first talked to online. “This isn’t an isolated  incident. There’s not much that’s unusual about it,” Kutcher said. “The  only unusual thing is that ‘Amy’ was found and returned to her family  within three days using a tool we created … called Spotlight.” Kutcher said the tool aids police in cutting investigation time by 60  percent, adding, “That’s my day job and I’m sticking to it.” It wasn’t all heavy: Kutcher and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) had a lighthearted moment after his speech. “You were better looking in the movies,” McCain said. Kutcher, blowing McCain, 80, a kiss, replied, “My wife says that, too.””  Slavery is still alive and well in the world, and he is helping to stamp it out.

It’s a short look at the early history of shoujo manga, namely talking a bit about a group of women who kicked a lot of ass and were majorly influential on manga in general. The intro does have a bit of discussion of the way shoujo manga and anime are denigrated more than they should be in Western anime fandom. It’s not a detailed history or anything, and if anyone has any corrections or additional info or whatnot I’d be happy to hear them- I could only go off what I found online. But I think a lot of people could at least learn about some cool ladies through this.  Some of you might recall I’ve been meaning to do a double feature on shoujo manga for like, a year. I was feeling pretty down last week (oh little did I know how much worse things would get) and to help myself in my funk I thought I’d try to do something I’d really been wanting to do for awhile but hadn’t gotten around to,so I could feel some sense of accomplishment. And thus, this finally happened. So if you could check it out, I’d love that.  Accompanying this article is another one- 13 Action-Packed Girls’ Manga with Awesome Leading Ladies.
