Wardens spent their free time to taught every mage in the city how to use staffs as a weapons in close and middle combat battle, which allowed them to live their lives freely even outside the city, because they didn’t have to worry that they will be killed (and also because they weren’t inprisoned within the city and could go wherever they wanted to after “graduating” - don’t worry, they don’t have to go through Harrowing or Joining).I like to think that they created various of clinics in small and large villages (even in Denerim) in Ferelden, which ended up as good evidences that mages are not a monsters, but a normal people, who deserve to live outside the Circle.The last thing that I like to think about is that the all mages who lived and trained in Amaranthine are thinking about this city as their home or second home, where they can return if they want to or where they can bring their families to live there with them, because it’s the safe place for them."

The things which are parts of my personality. The slightest try of changing them would affect me in a bad way. That’s why I was wondering if it’s abusive relationship.

Depends on the setting, ima do some type of desert/dusty place.  You’ll learn that the Lasso tool is gonna be your bae when it comes to environments…that and its pretty useful. Now your going to be working in three tones, 1.Dark 2.Mid 3.Light and it will always be the darkest at the front fading to light towards the back…make sense? So you will have three layers for each one to make your life easier and Lock those layers so you will only color within that area. Make sure the dark layer is on top.    Here is where the fun kicks in…we add our dets, try to stay with each tone and dont end up making it all muddy so you cant distinguish each one. Now you can go about this any way you please, you can paint it all in with one brush ( for some reason people get anal about shit like that, thinking there great for using one brush…i think if you got tools use em if you know how to do it right.) Or you can use custom brushes…since this is a tut ill mostly use custom brushes to slap stuff around. Its up to you really, also use the lasso tool like i said its your bae.  The lasso can help define things better for you, so i wanted to add a structure type on the third layer. If you want to give an effect that the selection ive made is in front of the background right click your selection and invert it, add some lighting around the edges…only a little though you dont want to over do it.  Also if you’ve done something on a layer you dont want to mess up or paint on what you can do is create a clipping mask on that layer. Its kinda like locking the layer to that one so you dont go outside of the layer or ruin what you worked on. Make a new layer above the one you wish to attach it to and right click the newlayer, a menu will pop up, your looking for clipping mask. Once you clicked it the layer should look like what ive circled.   Once your done working on each layer we are gonna put in some mist effect, this is something that helps separate each section. So make a new layer between each of your three as shown in the image. Like i said you can use what ever method you like, i just use a soft brush or cloud/mist brush to get what i want.     Now we are going to add some definition to the image a good one to use is Curves. You can find this where your layer menu is, at the bottom you’ll find it, ive circled what your looking for. On the third image is what will appear when you click curves, all you need to do is drag the little square and you’ll see some magic happen. So adjust it to your preference. If you want you can also mess with brightness/contrast too. ALSO i would recommend adding a person in the image, it gives you an idea of the scale your environment is.   I was going to end it there but hey, ill show one last thing…its pretty simple. and that is some water reflection, we are going to turn the middle into water instead cause its a little boring right now. I merged all layers but the first one, you then want to make a selection and copy/paste. Free transform in the shortcut is ctrl T and do a vertical flip on it then adjust so its mirroring the top.    Now make a clipping mask like i explained earlier on the reflected surface and use the radiant tool…i think its called that lol it gives it more of a water surface like you see. For the image below it i used a custom brush which creates a water effect, aaaaaaaaaand bam you got you water now covering the area…easy huh.   And so this concludes the Tutorial and you have the end result. Hopefully that gave some tips on how to approach landscapes…they can be confusing sometimes on where to start. Enjoy and let me know if it was useful or not :P " False text

They would purposely push them to their breaking point until they exploded, yelled, cursed, threw desks, and the ones who didn’t have that kind of reaction would just quit or end up fired because the kids would start rumors. One was because our new math teacher was effeminate so the guys thought “obviously this guy is gay and he’s after our dicks” and if he was ever nice to a male student (which… he was nice and friendly with EVERYONE and was the best teacher we’d had that year) they would start whispering behind me, “yo, look at that, did you see that? He’s flirting with his male students, that’s nasty” and so they made trouble for him.  My mother worked at a Discovery Zone type place when I was little and she would come home and break down crying because groups of little boys would call her names, call her stupid her whole shift. I had friends in childhood who absolutely abused their parents. They were relentless and mean and hacked them into submission and it made for a lot of awkward moments when I would hang with them, because I couldn’t do anything since… they were my abuser too. Just because you’re a minor doesn’t mean knives you throw are not sharp and won’t hit someone. The fact that so many kids on this site use their age as a weapon, as a way to say “but nothing I do has any impact because I have no social power” is SCARY and we need to try to make people aware of this kind of stuff from a young age because most people who are like that don’t really realize it and they need guidance and rehabilitation so the cycle can stop. Because those people grow up and have kids and do it to their kids and they don’t learn that it’s not normal or okay, that they cannot deny reality by controlling the people around them.  But sometimes it isn’t always that way, some of those parents were so nice and kind and I considered like family, and they just had absolute evil villains for kids.  Check in with yourselves, guys. Especially right now. There’s a lot of upsetting stuff being shoved in our faces all the time and it makes it hard not to get tunnel vision when our emotions get out of control, especially with the pressure to perform by a lot of social circles on tumblr. And if you’re young and a lot of this is new, pace yourself, you’re learning, and you need to be open to the idea of learning more and know that us being adults doesn’t mean we’re just out of touch boring old farts who don’t know anything. We’ve lived things and we have experience and when we say to you that it’s not okay to tell people who like things you do not like to kill themselves, we’re not “apologists”… we’re the survivors too.   yo this is really important my piano/choir teacher in 6th grade was only around 20-23 whenever she came to our school, and she only stayed for 2 years because all the kids were so awful. one time she told me that me and a few other of my friends were the only ones who hadn’t said a bad word about her the whole time. in 4th grade, we got an awesome music teacher. he was in his late 20’s at the time, really chill and easygoing (we were in elementary school). some of the kids would just slowly drive him off the edge until one day he ended up throwing pens across the room out of frustration and anger. everybody was either scared of him or laughed at him, and it kinda made it worse. he left 2 years later and teaches a civilized and nice group of kids now.  kids really can abuse adults. I’ve seen it happen a lot and it’s sad and heartbreaking and overall awful to see because so many people brush it off as “kids being kids.”  In 7th grade or so I had the most delightful Maths/Science teacher (the two were taught by the same guy) and he was always super nice. Like he adored teaching, he brought us snacks sometimes and like really wanted us to do well.  By 8th grade he was a changed man. We had young neo-nazis starting shit. We had kids screaming and throwing shit at him. We had knife fights and I’m 90% certain I remember him straight up being forced into a position where he had to wrestle one of my more violent classmates to the floor. My class had actually driven this calm, cool, great guy (he couldn’t’ve been more than 27 at the time) to actually break down crying in class. As far as I heard he was gone by the time I entered grade 9.   Weirdly, I was talking about this with my sister and cousins when we were talking about my old high school the other day. There was this one English teacher (I never had him myself so I forget his name) that EVERY class he had mocked him, yelled and threw things and moved things from his desk and stole and…it was unbelievable. Heard that one or two even attacked him. I never understood what their problem was because he seemed alright to me…Anyway, he left and I don’t blame the poor man. He was just trying to teach and people hurt him so badly, he left. He has ill health as well at the end of it all - so nasty behaviour like that can drive someone to physical problems too. And to those in life and the comments who are saying that kids can’t be abusive because they have no real power or have less emotional understanding, I ask this:If a teenager or child is performing the same abusive action as an adult, why is it not abuse? Why should we brush that off? If we don’t break that cycle, they WILL become abusive adults. The only difference then will be that they have the power they lack in childhood and nobody wants that cruelty.The way they gain emotional understanding is through learning and us teaching them. How will they understand otherwise?They might not know it’s abuse, but it is. I hope people in general can try and be kinder at some point in the future. We have to help each other.  Omg my classmates talked down to my German teacher almost every day in high school, and he was too nice to give them detentions so he just sat and had to take it day in and day out. I also had trouble with some of these students, but at least I could give them a sassy retort back to make them stop bothering me. The teacher had no such luxury.  Homophobic students called one of my teachers “f-ggot”. There was one teacher who broke down crying because of cruel those kids were to her. Then those students laughed at her, for crying. One student stole my 9th grade history teacher’s I-Phone. One student picked up a chair and was about to throw it at my writing teacher. :/   ppl who think children cannot do horrible shit and that the shit they do is not horrible shit or that they are not responsible for that are the same people who deny children agency when they need it and deny them choices in life as if they are not full humans yet and are adult’s property (parents, caregivers). Children do have agency and as much as they have it they are also responsible for horrible things they might do. If you do not see it and deny children recognition of their agency it can lead to horrible social results. Obviously a deep crisis of some sort is also needed and so the situation gets to this point but if everything is aligned then you get fucked up society people.Children are not only passive, they are active. And while there’s a whole issue of consent here as well, I would not comment on that but say that in other areas (non-sexual) of life their activeness and responsibility as well as power of decision making should be recognized for everyone’s sake.

Russian officials are saying this is impossible because “there are no gay people in Russia.” Really.   A spokesman for Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who is a vocal supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin, denied that any such activities have taken place. He further suggested that there are no gay people in the country at all. “You cannot arrest or repress people who just don’t exist in the republic,” spokesman Alvi Karimov said in a statement obtained by Radio Free Europe on Saturday. “If such people existed in Chechnya, law enforcement would not have to worry about them, as their own relatives would have sent them to where they could never return.”  Holy. Shit.     What needs to be understood here as well that this is, more than likely, sanctioned and ordered by the Russian state, and not just a random act of police violence. This isn’t some random act, it’s a continuing pattern and has been going on for a while now.  " False link

The teacher’s rebuttal:  I just commented this on a transphobic post that was all like, “In a sexual species, females have two X chromosomes and males have an X and a Y, I’m not a bigot it’s just science.” I’m a science teacher so I responded with this. First of all, in a sexual species, you can have females be XX and males be X (insects), you can have females be ZW and males be ZZ (birds), you can have females be females because they developed in a warm environment and males be males because they developed in a cool environment (reptiles), you can have females be females because they lost a penis sword fighting contest (some flatworms), you can have males be males because they were born female, but changed sexes because the only male in their group died (parrotfish and clownfish), you can have males look and act like females because they are trying to get close enough to actual females to mate with them (cuttlefish, bluegills, others), or you can be one of thousands of sexes (slime mold, some mushrooms.) Oh, did you mean humans? Oh ok then. You can be male because you were born female, but you have 5-alphareductase deficiency and so you grew a penis at age 12. You can be female because you have an X and a Y chromosome but you are insensitive to androgens, and so you have a female body. You can be female because you have an X and a Y chromosome but your Y is missing the SRY gene, and so you have a female body. You can be male because you have two X chromosomes, but one of your X’s HAS an SRY gene, and so you have a male body. You can be male because you have two X chromosomes- but also a Y. You can be female because you have only one X chromosome at all. And you can be male because you have two X chromosomes, but your heart and brain are male. And vice - effing - versa. Don’t use science to justify your bigotry. The world is way too weird for that shit.   Addressing this to the TERF that assaulted me. " False link

The transplant could be conducted on a woman ‘born without a uterus, or who had it removed or have uterine damage’ – this would make trans women eligible for the procedure. A 26-year-old woman who is undergoing the screening process told The Times: ‘I crave that experience. ‘I want the morning sickness, the backaches, the feet swelling. I want to feel the baby move. That is something I’ve wanted for as long as I can remember.’ Dr Christine McGinn, a plastic surgeon, told Yahoo News: ‘The human drive to be a mother for a woman is a very serious thing. ‘Transgender women are no different.’”  Medical miracle.  I’d donate mine :) I’m not using it.  I will happily donate my uterus to a trans woman in need as soon as this procedure is confirmed as safe.  Heck yes take mine I’m not doing anything with it  TAKE MIIIIIINE. Idk if I’d be viable because mine has varicose veins but maybe they can remove them but TAKE IT. FOR GODS SAKE.  Oh my god mine is viable and I do no want any kind of bio kid, WHO WANTS MY UTERUS? FREE TO GOOD HOME! " False link

Since I can’t find the lyrics. Probably it is in Elvish. And probably this is the song “Rise” from the Inquisition. I have only one hint, which can proove it. “Ara” means “me”. The English translation of Rise begins with the words “Find me”. And it’s all.As I said a few days ago I think that it is Andraste’s song (not exactly the Song of Light in elvish but also Andraste’s song). Or Mythal’s song. Because… according to the one of the fan’s theory: Andraste = Mythal. Proofs: the Temple of Sacred Ashes.It sounds…. WISELY. I can believe in it. I wanna. It’s extremely cool!" True link
