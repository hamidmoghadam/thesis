I know many of you have problems with pronunciation in swedish, like how to say “j” or “skj” it’s not really difficult but you need to learn it to get a perfect swedish!   Pronounce each syllable as if it formed part of an English word, and you will be understood sufficiently well. Remember the points below, and your pronunciation will be even closer to the Swedish. And: nearly everyone, everywhere in Sweden speaks English.     A vowel is usually long when it’s the final syllable or followed by only one consonant; followed by two it’s generally short. Unfamiliar combinations are:   å when short as in hot (långt) , when long as in raw (igår).  ä when before r as in man (nära) ; otherwise as in get (träffas).  ej (nej) as in mate.    ö as in fur but without the r sound (första).   Consonants are pronounced as in English except:    g when before i, j, y, d, v, or ö as in yet (Göteborg); otherwise hard g as in get (vardagar) ; occasionally as in shut.   j, dj, lj as in yet (jag).  k before i,e,y,ä or ö like sh in sheep (kycklingsoppa), otherwise hard (fisk).    qu as kv (queer).    sch, skj, stj as in shut (stjäla); otherwise hard.    tj like sh in sheep (tjuv).  z as in so (zäta).                                       ♡ Hope this helps ♡    This is a very helpful post, but I’d like to add that although many of these are helpful, they are approximations. There are Swedish sounds that simply don’t translate to English ones (tj isn’t exactly sh), so the absolute best thing to do is to use IPA and look at what the sounds actually are, and how to pronounce them. There are few videos about this on YouTube ( https://youtu.be/LFXCHM4NYBM ). Of course, you can be understood without having perfect pronunciation, but this should help those who want to go the extra mile 👌😁 " False text

African leaders are seeking ways to feed their peoples and become players in the global economy.In the second edition of The New Harvest: Agricultural Innovation in Africa, I argue that Africa can feed itself in a generation. However, efforts to achieve such an ambitious goal continue to be frustrated by policies adopted by Africa’s historical trading partners, especially the European Union.There are at least three ways in which EU policies affect Africa’s ability to address its agricultural and food challenges: tariff escalation; technological innovation and food export preferences.African leaders would like to escape the colonial trap of being viewed simply as raw material exporters. But their efforts to add value to the materials continue to be frustrated by existing EU policies.Take the example of coffee. In 2014 Africa —the home of coffee— earned nearly $2.4 billion from the crop. Germany, a leading processor, earned about $3.8 billion from coffee re-exports.The concern is not that Germany benefits from processing coffee. It is that Africa is punished by EU tariff barriers for doing so. Non-decaffeinated green coffee is exempt from the charges. However, a 7.5 per cent charge is imposed on roasted coffee. As a result, the bulk of Africa’s export to the EU is unroasted green coffee.The charge on cocoa is even more debilitating. It is reported that the “EU charges (a tariff) of 30 per cent for processed cocoa products like chocolate bars or cocoa powder, and 60 per cent for some other refined products containing cocoa.”The impact of such charges goes well beyond lost export opportunities. They suppress technological innovation and industrial development among African countries. The practice denies the continent the ability to acquire, adopt and diffuse technologies used in food processing. It explains to some extent the low level of investment in Africa’s food processing enterprises." False link

It’s not just a subject,” said Peter Geikie, who works for Inuit  Tapiriit Kanatami. He said he was was impressed by the years of work  that Wales put in to revitalizing their traditional language. On the other hand, Inuit schools require lessons be taught in  Inuktitut until grade three, but it is taught as a subject, similar to  core French or Spanish classes, starting in grade four. Monica Ittusardjuat, the national Inuit language coordinator for  Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, says that the language policies adopted by the  Welsh could serve as a model — and it’s now up to the Inuit to learn  from other cultures and apply it for their children. “They can pass it on to the next generation,” she said. “We have to make it fun and interesting for them.”   " False link

Words like “endangered”, “struggling”, “precarious”, “sleeping”, and “revitalizing” emphasize the agency of the communities involved, even in the case where a language is brought back into speech from writings and recordings.   Reblogging again because stuff like this is so important. Please watch the video–it’s so amazing and heart felt.  This is amazing.

In a progress report released earlier this week, the EU severely criticized Turkey for backsliding in democracy but praised its efforts to contain refugees inside the country. Criticizing Europe for not accepting even 100 or 500 refugees, Erdoğan brought to mind the EU’s promise to give Turkey 3 billion euros in June in addition to another 3 billion. “As far as I can remember, until now the EU has only given Turkey 250-300 million euros,” Erdoğan said. The EU has been criticized for not taking any concrete action against Turkey despite growing despotism in the country for the sake of a refugee deal that was agreed earlier this year.

On this side of the world things are much simpler: English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and a few Dutch speakers make communication generally much smoother across the continent, along with a few New World Patois thrown into the mix for good measure. At least so the thinking goes. In reality, the American continent is a place of vast linguistic diversity, with more language families found solely in Mexico than in the entirety of the European continent. And with each language comes a particular vision of the world, an inimitable expressivity, a treasure trove of wisdom accrued over the centuries and codified in words and idioms. Yet these languages struggle desperately for survival in the midst of a post-colonial landscape dominated by a small handful of European languages.
