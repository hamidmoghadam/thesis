A source tells ET that Swift ‚Äúhas been busy working on her upcoming album.‚ÄùAccording to the source, the ‚ÄúShake It Off‚Äù singer has been figuring out what the sound and feel of her new album is going to be, and whether or not she wants to continue in the pop genre that propelled her last album to record-shattering success, or return to her beloved country roots.However, the source did note that Swift‚Äôs next big album is expected to drop by the end of the year.Swift has stayed off the radar in a big way while working on creating her new music. While typically ubiquitous on social media, the 27-year-old songstresshas only posted to Instagram once in the last two months, and that was to promote the release of her friend and fellow pop diva Lorde‚Äôs latest single, ‚ÄúGreen Light.‚ÄùWhile keeping out of the spotlight, ET‚Äôs source says Swift has been staying closer to home, spending time in Nashville, Tennessee, where the singer was recently spotted driving around just last week.‚ÄúShe comes here to get away from the paparazzi,‚Äù an eyewitness suggested to ET.While the news of Swift‚Äôs forthcoming sixth studio album is music to many fans‚Äô ears, the singer‚Äôs squad of gal pals apparently knew that she‚Äôd returned to the recording studio months ago.Back in September, Swift turned out to support her bestie Gigi Hadid as she walked the runway at the Tommy Hilfiger fashion show in New York City. ET caught up with Hadid at the event, and the model revealed why it was such a treat to see Swift at the event.‚ÄúShe‚Äôs obviously such a great friend and you know, she is starting to go back to work in the studio again and really made time to be here for me and I am so grateful for that,‚Äù Hadid shared.ET has reached out to Swift‚Äôs reps for comment.Swift‚Äôs months-long absence really shouldn‚Äôt come as much of a surprise, considering the fact that she was very upfront with her decision to not tour or perform throughout 2017 when she played the DirecTV Now Super Saturday Night pre-Super Bowl concert two months ago.‚ÄúBy coming to this show tonight, you are attending 100 percent of this year‚Äôs tour dates,‚Äù she told the star-studded audience.

Home to Taylor Swift ¬≠(purportedly for just one more album), Florida Georgia Line and, until recently, The Band Perry and Tim McGraw, the super-indie leaped ahead of competitors Sony Nashville and Warner Nashville in market share. In 2016, it claimed the three top singles on Billboard‚Äôs Hot Country Songs chart, led by FGL‚Äôs ‚ÄúH.O.L.Y.‚Äù And as recently as February, programmers attending the 2017 Country Radio Seminar (CRS) voted Big Machine the ¬≠format‚Äôs top label. So when word quietly slipped out in early March about the ¬≠shuttering of Dot Records, one of BMLG‚Äôs five imprints, on the heels of several longtime executives departing for new gigs (among them: senior vp sales Kelly Rich to Amazon, senior vp partnership ¬≠marketing and ¬≠promotion strategy John Zarling to Sony and senior vp promotion Jack Purcell to ¬≠management ¬≠company EM.Co), Music Row watchers began ¬≠wondering whether BMLG had run into some growing pains after expanding into a major. It‚Äôs a question founder/CEO Scott Borchetta, whose renown has grown beyond the industry (the 54-year-old was a mentor for three seasons on American Idol), is happy to tackle head on. ‚ÄúIt really started at the 10-year turn ‚Äì ¬≠knowing that we became this big label by taking chances and saying, ‚ÄòWait a ¬≠minute: We‚Äôre ¬≠starting to do a lot of the things that I didn‚Äôt like about major labels,‚Äô ‚Äù Borchetta tells Billboard. A bloated roster was one of those traits, and BMLG began by ¬≠dropping ‚Äúprobably 12 or 13 ¬≠artists over the last 16 to 17 months,‚Äù says Borchetta, along with ¬≠voluntary exits by The Band Perry (to take a shot at pop ¬≠success) and McGraw (who, ¬≠partnered with wife Faith Hill, got a richer deal at Sony).

The affluent town is also home to Ralph Lauren, Bruce Willis, and Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones.(Martha Stewart lives around the corner ‚Äî and worked closely with the couple when designing their South Carolina wedding.)Choosing to live outside of the paparazzi‚Äôs prime territory has made it easier for Lively and Reynolds to enjoy their downtime and stay out of the media spotlight.‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been nesting for quite a while now,‚Äù a source previously told PEOPLE. ‚ÄúThey moved to the suburbs, which has a pretty conservative lifestyle. They also picked a very traditional kind of house for people who work in Hollywood. They wanted a house with character, not a trendy, modern house. Their place is very homey. [Lively] is very domestic.‚ÄùReynolds echoed that in December 2015, telling The Project, ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt lead a wild and crazy life.‚Äù‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt live in L.A., we live on a farm in New York,‚Äù PEOPLE‚Äôs 2010 Sexiest Man Alive said ‚Äî adding that when it comes to his own personality, he just not the going-out-all-night, hard-partying kind of star.‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been the guy stumbling out of bars at three in the morning, at least that anyone is aware of,‚Äù Reynolds explained. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never been my thing.‚ÄùPARENTHOODInstead, Reynolds‚Äô ‚Äúthing‚Äù has been being a dad to 2-year-old daughter James and his newborn daughter, whose name hasn‚Äôt been released since she was born in September.‚ÄúHaving a daughter was a dream come true for me,‚Äù Reynolds previously told PEOPLE,. ‚ÄúIf I could have nine daughters, I would be thrilled. Really, like I genuinely would be.‚Äù‚ÄúI‚Äôm just fine being surrounded by estrogen,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúI grew up in a house full of testosterone: I‚Äôm the youngest of four boys, and my dad was a cop, and that‚Äôs intense. For whatever reason, I always got along great with girls. I don‚Äôt have to prepare to be wrapped around my daughter‚Äôs finger ‚Äì it has happened.‚Äù‚ÄúI would not be an unhappy man if I had a six-person soccer team of girls,‚Äù he joked.There‚Äôs plenty of practice room for the team on Lively and Reynolds‚Äô 2-acre home. Overlooking the Cross River Reservoir, the space is a quiet sanctuary for the family. And both are hoping to expand their tribe.‚ÄúMy wife is the youngest of five; we‚Äôd love to have a large family,‚Äù Reynolds said.‚ÄúI‚Äôve always wanted a big family,‚Äù Lively previously told PEOPLE. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt just raise your kids, your kids also raise each other ‚Äì oh my Lord, the things I learned from my brother Eric. He‚Äôs influenced my life so much. So I‚Äôm looking forward to how one baby influences the other, and to my family as a whole, to every single chapter.‚ÄùCOUPLE TIMEWhile their family has remained a priority, Reynolds and Lively still find time to be together alone ‚Äî sneaking off for date nights in Paris, supporting one another at film premieres, and always gushing about their love to the press.They first met when they costarred together in 2011‚Äôs Green Lantern ‚Äî but didn‚Äôt start dating until a year after the film‚Äôs release. ‚ÄúFireworks were going off between us,‚Äù Reynolds told PEOPLE of the moment the two realized romance was a possibility between them.Lively added that she was grateful they had the time to get to know one another on a friendly level first.‚ÄúWe were such good friends for so long and we both got to know each other as friends,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I appreciate about our relationship. He really is my friend first and foremost ‚Äî not just in our history, but in our everyday life first. And I think that‚Äôs the secret to my happiness.‚ÄùIn October, the couple celebrated Reynolds‚Äô 40th birthday at Japanese restaurant O Ya in New York City ‚Äî the place Lively said they ‚Äúfell in love.‚ÄùThe high-end eatery was decorated with ribbons and photos of the happy couple from moments throughout their relationship. They even snapped a photo while holding a throwback photo from Reynolds‚Äô 35th birthday party ‚Äì around the time they first started dating.Of course, no appearance has been as sweet yet as when the Reynolds-Lively brood made their first public outing to cheer on Reynolds for his new star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The happy couple posed for photos while holding their two children.It‚Äôs good to get out of the ‚Äòburbs now and again." False link

belleswift17 158475819764 "2017-03-16 15:09:08 GMT" http://belleswift17.tumblr.com/post/158475819764/taylor-swifts-new-trademarks-what-they-mean-and "it-feels-like-a-perfect-night:   MAR 15, 2017Taylor Swift fans went wild after a TMZ story speculated that Swift was ‚Äúdone fighting with Spotify‚Äù and instead launching her own music streaming service. The evidence? One of Swift‚Äôs companies, TAS Rights Management, filed a slew of trademarks last month, which was noted by Reddit users several weeks ago. However, despite the filings to use the words ‚ÄúSwiftie‚Äù and ‚ÄúSwifties‚Äù (the nicknames for Swift‚Äôs loyal fans) in several categories, including ‚Äúa website featuring non-downloadable audio recordings [and] video recordings,‚Äù it‚Äôs highly unlikely Swift is planning a streaming service of her own anytime soon as TMZ postulates. Why?For starters, Swift already has a very high profile‚Äîand presumably very lucrative‚Äîstreaming partnership with Apple. Another one of her global partners, AT&T, launched a cross-device video streaming experience called Taylor Swift Now last November. It wouldn‚Äôt make sense for Swift to compete with these already-established partnerships, and Swift certainly isn‚Äôt known for making business missteps. You don‚Äôt become the world‚Äôs highest-paid celebrity with $170 million in earnings without being an exceptionally smart businesswoman.Savvy celebrities file trademarks all the time for ideas and products that may or may not ever come to fruition. Sometimes it‚Äôs done preemptively to keep others from taking ownership of marks that have a strongly perceived tie to the celebrity even though the projects may never see the light of day. For instance, in 2010, Swift filed for permission to use her name on makeup and cosmetics. No such product line was ever developed (although she did lend her name and likeness to CoverGirl around the same time), and the trademark was abandoned in 2014.Swift‚Äôs TAS Rights Management currently owns more than 90 active and dead trademarks, including for phrases like ‚ÄúSwiftmas,‚Äù ‚ÄúBlank Space‚Äù and ‚ÄúA Girl Named Girl.‚Äù Swift herself owns several other trademarks, including her name, various iterations of her logo and signature and other trademarks relating to her albums.So, what could the filings mean? Perhaps nothing. Or‚Äîmuch more exciting for Swift fans‚Äîperhaps they point to an enhanced version of Swift‚Äôs fan club launching in the months ahead. Swift doesn‚Äôt currently have a paid fan club, which is unusual for a superstar on her level. Many artists generate hundreds of thousands of dollars of revenue each year from paid membership clubs. Fans, in turn, are granted items like early pre-sale access to concert tickets, exclusive content downloads, annual merch packages and a private forum to communicate.Since ‚ÄúSwifties‚Äù is the term Swift‚Äôs fans have embraced for years, it seems likely that an official ‚ÄúSwiftie Community‚Äù could be in the works to align with Swift‚Äôs next album launch. Swift‚Äôs next album release has not been announced, but her past releases suggest it will come this September or October. The specific merchandise trademark categories (musical instruments, clothing, stationary), plus the specific mention of online retail store services and content downloads, all seem to support an impending premium fan club, which would likely exist through both a premium app and a web platform. Swift‚Äôs official website is run by Wonderful Union, a company well known for managing high-profile artist fan clubs.Regardless of what the recent trademarks may or may not mean, #Swifties can count on lots more carefully crafted marketing from Swift as the year unfolds."

That‚Äôs where Martin Schwimmer, trademark lawyer at Leason Ellis and the man behind the Trademark Blog, comes in.The first red flag? The filing could be entirely about a Swift Web site already in existence that uses the word ‚ÄúSwiftie‚Äù and plays her music. As Schwimmer points out, the line that TMZ focused on‚Äî‚Äúfeaturing non-downloadable multi-media content in the nature of audio recordings‚Äù‚Äîcites its ‚Äúfirst use‚Äù as October 2014.Second, there‚Äôs the number of categories that TAS Rights Management, Swift‚Äôs trademark lawyers, filed to‚Äînine total‚Äîfrom musical instruments to online retail stores to bags to notebooks to educational resources. All of these could be ‚ÄúSwiftie,‚Äù streaming service or no.News stories about trademark applications often bubble up around Swift and other business-minded celebrities like Beyonc√©, Kylie Jenner, and Kanye West) because it‚Äôs public information that‚Äôs easily searchable at the United States Patent and Trademark Office. They‚Äôre rarely good for predicting what a celebrity will do since it‚Äôs just a good strategy‚Äîif you have the money‚Äîto mark your space in a bunch of different categories, just in case.At the end of 2015, for example, Swift‚Äôs lawyers moved to trademark ‚ÄúSwiftmas,‚Äù ‚ÄúBlank Space,‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôll Write Your Name,‚Äù ‚ÄúA Girl Named Girl,‚Äù and ‚Äú1989.‚Äù Though several of these appear to still be pending, Swift owns ‚Äúthis sick beat‚Äù as it applies to 16 categories, and ‚Äúcause we never go out of style‚Äù in two, and ‚ÄúNice to meet you. ‚Äôve you been?‚Äù in three. Swift‚Äôs team of lawyers also successfully litigated in China against trademark infringement the same year, and Etsy sellers using Swift‚Äôs trademarked lyrics are frequent recipients of cease-and-desist letters.But if the filing that you may or may not use is likely to go public and possibly get misconstrued, why trademark at all? ‚ÄúShe needs that registration for enhanced policing,‚Äù explained Schwimmer. ‚ÄúAnd there‚Äôs another thing, which is: you need registrations to get intermediaries to pay attention to you. So if you go to Amazon and want to take down stuff; you go to a domain name company or eBay, and you want them to take down the infringing stuff, [the companies] don‚Äôt want to have to evaluate whether you are the real whatever. The easiest thing is to say, ‚ÄòHere is my trademark registration.‚Äô ‚ÄùThen again, the last time a celebrity trademark filing got the Internet worked up, Beyonc√© and Jay Z ended up losing the bid to trademark the name of their daughter, Blue Ivy (it was already taken by a Boston-based wedding planner).Vanity Fair has reached out to Swift‚Äôs representative for comment."
