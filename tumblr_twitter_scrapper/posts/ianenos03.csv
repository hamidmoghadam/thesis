On every side of the pen were huge signs saying “You can pet me, but don’t pick me up!”  One day two absolutely huge guys came in and one immediately reaches into the pen to grab a rabbit. Before i could say anything his friend grabbed his arm and asked him  “did you see the sign?”He said “yeah! it says that you can pick them up but don’t pet them!”Then he went quiet for a moment and softly said “I didn’t read it right did I?”And his friend just puts his arm on his shoulder and said “its ok, i know you’ve got that thing where words get mixed up. Let just pet these cute lil shits”And I still haven’t gotten over that interaction.  I was walking my dog through Boston bc he likes the like car rides. He’s a little thing tbh we call him short and long.So this huge scary man with a full beard approaches me like “hey can my buddy and I pet your dog? He gets nervous around dogs but your’s is so small I think it’s a good place to start.” Ofc I was like “yes he’s very friendly!” So this guy brings his equally big friend over and they sit on the floor while this man looks terrified of my tiny dog so big man number one asks “can I pick him up?” And i say yes so he picks him up and puts him on man number two’s lap and man number two is abt to freak out and his friend straight up just goes “hey man, it’s okay just relax I’d never let anything hurt you. He’s a good boy.” I’ll never forget it ever bc I know that man looked at me (5'3 , glasses, probably wearing a sweater vest) and my dog (kinda goofy looking little thing) and was like ‘ah yes the two least intimidating living things I’ve seen in Boston all day he’ll feel relaxed around them’ and went out of his way to help his friend.

I wanted to provide you with an update on something I’ve been dealing with alone and in silence because I’m tired of feeling silenced and I need people to know what I’m dealing with and help support me through it. I’m an undergraduate student at UNCW who happens to be queer as well as a muslim immigrant, and I have spent the last two years of my life being harassed relentlessly by a tenured professor who insists on comparing me to ISIS, sending his students and supporters after me to make death threats, writing blog posts about me claiming it’s not possible for me to be queer and muslim, slandering me in his classes, and ultimately doing everything he can to use his power, privileges, and platforms over me to make my life hell to try and stop me from speaking out against injustice. The university has been letting him do this since my freshman year and it’s only gotten worse these past few months. This professor (who is 30+ years older than me, by the way) wrote an article about me called ‘A ‘Queer Muslim’ Jihad?’ outing me, comparing me to militant Islamic groups, attacking my intelligence, diagnosing me with mental illnesses I don’t have, and just being the most despicable kind of person you could be. And if the article ITSELF wasn’t bad enough the comments are even better! :)  Not to mention that, because he used my full name, his supporters have been blowing up my Facebook with horrible comments and really despicable threats. Almost all of these people being 40+ year old white men doing this to a 19 year old girl. I tried to talk to my university about this and let them know that I was tired of having to defend myself, my name, my sexuality, my religion, my EVERYTHING from a professor who is in a higher position of power over me and they told me they couldn’t do anything because he’d just sue the university.  And I’m just tired. I’m really, really tired. And I want all of you to see what the fuck I’ve been having to deal with and know why I legitimately do not want to continue my education somewhere where I continuously have to be called a jihadist. I don’t want to be threatened anymore. I don’t want to be demeaned. I don’t want to be stuck in an environment that deems this sort of behavior as okay. And I don’t know what to do. Here’s a link to the article though. [x]   Read it and see the things I’ve been forced to hear about me and my religion and my sexuality all for the sake of getting an education. Read it and see all the hatred that people of color are forced to combat just to be able to get a degree.Read it and see how fucking hard it is for black women to succeed anywhere because people like this will say/do anything to bring us down.Read it and understand that if a professor wrote about a white student this way it would have never been acceptable, but he knows he can get away with it because nobody cares about harassment against black students.Read it and understand how fucked up society is. And please help me figure out what to do, because I legitimately feel like I’m drowning.  BOOSTING THIS  I don’t know how to help, but someone out there does.   Wish I could offer some real advice here.  If the article is inaccurate enough you may be able to sue him for libel and have the article removed, but you would have to talk to a lawyer about that. Regardless, you shouldn’t have to resort to getting a lawyer to deal with a professor who has left such a blatant trail, the school should take action.  Mike S. Adams, professor of criminology at UNC-Wilmington. His profile says he’s been a high-profile conservative/Republican for a lot of years and won a major “free speech” court case against the UNCW in 2011 so the university may be reluctant to take action against him for those reasons?  Doesn’t give many details other than it was ruled the university can’t “discriminate on the basis of the professor’s viewpoint” in his published columns and speeches when he applied for tenure, etc., but it may have something to do with this  I have to reshape this because I am downright disgusted. I’ve been following this account for a couple months but I had no idea what this woman was actually going through. Whatever you believe this straight up antagonism this grown man has for this woman is rooted so deeply in prejudice and is so vile I can’t believe this man is in a position of power. I am at a loss for words. I want so badly to help her but I don’t even know what to do.  I wanted to give you guys some people you can e-mail. I don’t know if it’ll make much of a difference, but if you want to reach out to my university administration and let them know you feel like this is unacceptable I’d really appreciate it.   UNCW Chancellor: Chancellor@uncw.edu    UNCW Vice Chancellor: leonard@uncw.edu  UNCW Dean of Students: walkerm@uncw.edu UNCW Head of Diversity:   guionk@uncw.edu  Thank you guys for the support. I love you very much  not to say sending emails isn’t gonna help but post this up on twitter with the uni’s hashtags as well, on facebook, and whatever other sm accounts they have; don’t let them fucking ignore this make it as public as possible and don’t let them escape y'all  ^^^^^ " False text

She is not perfect, but I honestly think she is the most prepared candidate who has ever run for the office and, while I’m skeptical that anything short of a super majority in the Senate and a blue House can alleviate the gridlock in Washington, Secretary Clinton has as good a chance as anyone to accomplish something worthwhile over the next four years in the White House.On the contrary, her opponent is a man so bereft of self control that his own staff wouldn’t allow him to use his Twitter account. A man who can’t be trusted with tweets should be trusted with nuclear weapons?Hillary lies, does she? Trump lies like it’s a bodily function. Just the latest in a list so extensive that I couldn’t possibly begin to enumerate it, he claimed, in public view, that President Obama “screamed” at one of his supporters when, in fact, Obama defended the man’s right to free speech. And speaking of free speech, Trump seems to value authoritarian governing tactics far more than the Bill of Rights, though it is unclear if Trump supporters are aware of the existence of Amendments 1 and 3-10.Trump has no feasible economic platform to speak of and markets have consistently responded negatively when the general election has pivoted toward Trump. It seems that Trump’s only proposals of any consequence address imagined problems, like building a prohibitively expensive wall to keep out “Mexican rapists.” Pretty good idea, considering undocumented immigration across the Mexican border has been waning for years and that undocumented immigrants commit violent crimes at a far lower rate than do American citizens, for pretty obvious reasons. But, to be fair, they’re brown, so, you know, fuck ‘em.This is a man who believes that black people in America have nothing to live for, but also seems completely uninterested in examining the role of slum lords like himself and his father in creating this supposed state of affairs.The Man You Can Bait with a Tweet is so spectacularly unfit to be the President of the United States that the Cincinnati Enquirer and Columbus Dispatch endorsed a Democrat for the first time in 100 years. The Arizona Republic for the first time in 126 years. The Dallas Morning News and Houston Chronicle joined in. The Atlantic issued only its third presidential endorsement ever (Lincoln, Lyndon Johnson, Clinton). And even those papers that couldn’t bring themselves to endorse Clinton haven’t turned to Trump (his only major endorsement comes from a paper with significant financial ties to the campaign), but rather no-nothing Libertarian Gary Johnson, a man whose ignorance would be astonishing in any other election cycle. And the inexplicably conservative Detroit newspapers have endorsed Clinton (Free Press) and Johnson (News).Donald Trump has repeatedly praised his daughter’s beauty and on an unsettling number of occasions stopped just short of publicly proclaiming that he wants to fuck her. At the Republican National Convention, you know, the crown jewel of campaign season, Trump creepily embraced his daughter’s hip, at which point she instantly recoiled. Not the first time, perhaps? The man has been sued for rape and palled around with billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, the rapist and registered sex offender about whom Trump had to say: “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.” And then there’s the “locker room talk,” aka the blatant admission of likely serial sexual assault. A billionaire physically fixated on his own daughter known to keep the company of convicted rapists who admits to “grabbing women by the pussy?” If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck…Let’s not pretend we don’t know what this is all about. Hillary Clinton is an intelligent, well-prepared woman who has shown throughout the last four decades that she cares about people. Donald Trump has shown that he only cares for himself, lying about donating to charity and insulting just about every ethnic group, religion, and race not “American” enough for him. I don’t consider calling the racists, homophobes, xenophobes, sexists, and assholes with whom Trump’s message has resonated “a basket of deplorables” to be at all scandalous.Courting that segment of the population is beyond scandalous, it is deplorable. If you vote Trump, you don’t get to separate yourself from the the things he’s said and done. Don’t be deplorable." True text

I hope she spends the rest of her life in prison.  hey if you’re allistic you absolutely need to reblog this. this needs to get out there. just saying  hey how about allistics not fucking ignore this like every other murder of autistic children, dont ignore how the media is painting the mother as stressed and on edge as an excuse, dont ignore how she’s not being fully blamed and how this was an “understandable” response because her child was too much of a “burden.” dont fucking ignore this. the media is victim blaming a dead six year old do not ignore this  this post doesn’t even have a thousand notes, allistic tumblr SJs prove yet again that they don’t give a fuck about autistic children getting killed by their allistic caretakers! great job! fuck every allistic! every single one  tumblr’s sj activism truly and honestly doesn’t extend to people who have mental disabilities, impairments, or disorders and i’m really not surprised that this particular story is receiving 0 attention thus far. overall support of the mentally ill only extends to people who have mental illnesses that are relatively ‘safe’ to talk about (depression, anxiety, etc) and the ones that are less relatable (autism) or considered ‘taboo’ (bipolar disorder, schizophrenia) are ignored and swept under the rug constantly. although i will say, in addition to the above, that i have also noticed that the murderers of autistic children are always, always put in a sympathetic light. as if they were pushed to the edge because of their child’s disorder. it’s really disgusting!! if you care about disabled people take some time out of your day to give stories like this attention because this shit happens all the time and some of yall are still in a state of denial about it  Not to suggest that adequate services are available to families with these kinds of problems, but zero sympathy for this monster. Fucking zero. Zero zero zero. Monster." False link

They were about to share something personal and hurtful with this room full of mostly strangers. They were going to talk about something they didn’t normally share with their white friends or colleagues. It was about to get real in that room. In the aftermath of the killing of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager fatally shot by a white Ferguson, Missouri police officer, conversations about race in the St. Louis area have been loaded. Christi Griffin, the president of The Ethics Project, wanted this to be different. She wanted to invite mothers of other races to hear directly from black mothers the reality of raising a black son in America. She wanted them to hear the words they each had said to their own sons, in different variations over the years, but all with the same message: Stay alive. Come home alive. She wanted mothers who had never felt the fear, every single time their son walked outside or drove a car, that he could possibly be killed to hear what that felt like. Griffin’s son, now grown, had never gotten in trouble nor given her any trouble growing up. But when her son was 14 years old, the family moved into an all-white neighborhood. She took him to the police department to introduce him to the staff. She wanted the officers to know that he belonged there, that he lived there. When he turned 16, it was time for another talk. Every single time he got into his car to drive, she made him take his license out of his wallet and his insurance card out of the glove compartment. “I did not want him reaching for anything in the car.” He graduated from college with a degree in physics. Marlowe Thomas-Tulloch said that when she noticed her grandson was getting bigger and taller, she laid bare a truth to him: Son, if the police stop you, I need for you to be humble. But I need more than that. I need for you to be prepared to be humiliated. If they tell you take your hands out of your pockets, take your hands out. Be ready to turn your pockets out. If they tell you to sit down, be prepared to lie down. You only walk in the street with one boy at a time, she told him. “What?” her grandson said. In his 17-year-old mind, he hadn’t done anything wrong and nothing was going to happen to him. “If it’s three or more, you’re a mob,” she said. “That’s how they will see you.” She started to cry. “Listen to me,” she begged. “Hear me.” Finally, she felt him feel her fear. If they ask you who you are, name your family. Yes, sir and no, sir. If they are in your face, even if they are wrong, humble yourself and submit yourself to the moment. “I’m serious,” she said. “Because I love you.” She told him she would rather pick him up from the police station than identify his body at a morgue. When her grandson left to go home, she called her daughter to tell her about the conversation. Her daughter asked her what she had said, because her son came home upset, with tears in his eyes. “I hope I said enough to save his life,” Thomas-Tulloch said. “I’d rather go down giving him everything I got.” The mothers talked about the times their sons had been stopped in their own neighborhoods because “they fit the description.” They shared the times their sons had come home full of rage and hurt for being stopped and questioned for no reason. And they told the other mothers how often they told their sons to simply swallow the injustice of the moment. Because they wanted them alive, above all. Amy Hunter, director of racial justice at the YWCA in metro St. Louis, said it’s taken her 10 years to be able to share this story about her son without crying. She didn’t want her white friends to see her cry when she told it. She didn’t want to look weak. Her four children are now older, but when one of her sons was 12, he decided to walk home from the Delmar Loop in University City where he had met some friends. He saw a police officer circling him, and he knew. He was wearing Sperrys, a tucked-in polo shirt, a belt. He was 12, and he knew, but he was scared. He lived five houses away, and he hadn’t done anything wrong. “I knew you were home,” he said to his mom when he finally made it home after being frisked. “I knew I was about to get stopped, and I thought about running home to you.” His mother froze. “I forgot to tell him,” she said. “I forgot to tell him: Don’t run. Don’t run or they’ll shoot you.” Her 12-year-old cried when he told her what had happened and asked if he was stopped because he was black. “Probably, yeah,” she said. “I just want to know, how long will this last?” he asked her. That’s when she started to cry. “For the rest of your life,” she said. It doesn’t matter about your college degree, the car you drive, the street you live on, she told the moms in the audience. It’s not going to shield your child like a Superman cape. She admitted that it was difficult to share these painful moments. Just one of the mothers on the stage asked a single question of the audience. Assata Henderson, who has raised three children, all college graduates, said she called her sons to ask them what they remembered about “the talk” she had given them about how to survive as a black man. “Mama, you talked all the time,” they said to her. It made her wonder, she said. She said she wasn’t pointing any fingers, but it made her wonder about the conversations the other mothers were having with their sons, who grow up to be police officers, judges and CEOs. “You’re the mothers,” she said to the crowd. “What are the conversations you are having with the police officers who harass our children?” " False link
