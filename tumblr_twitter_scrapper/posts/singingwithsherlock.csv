(Unlike the other three, she hasn’t tweeted about it, and also she’s a minor, so because I have a shred of decency, unlike Travis Aaron Wade, I want to keep her name out of this as far as possible.) He’s demanding that they take down every post about him, on all social media platforms, in 10 days or he’s threatening lawsuits and damages. To spell this out: Travis Aaron Wade groomed and sexually harassed girls and women, bullied them, harassed and cyberstalked them, somehow found out their home addresses, and is now trying to scare them into silence. Travis Aaron Wade keeps escalating and he seems pathologically unable to stop. This is a time when the fandom needs to come together. Please sign this petition to have him banned from cons and stop his access to young women in the fandom. Have people who care about your safety sign it too.

Some are even reluctant to go to cons because they don’t feel safe after experiences that they (or their friends) had with TAW.
