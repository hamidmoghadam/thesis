FriendLike fine snow that drifts in the wide sky	Like fine snow	If I could drift away to you	I’d be able to reach you quickly, but…Petals of snow	They drifted down	And then disappearedI miss youI miss youHow much do I have to wish	How many freezing nights do I have to count	To be able to see you?	To be able to meet you?Until the kind spring day that tells us the end of winter	Until the flowers bloom	I want you to stay, just like this	Just like thisYou changed?	If not, then I changed	To bear this passing of time	I guess change happens again	It must be like that for everyone, right?That’s right, this moment in which you left	My feelings that never wavered won’t change	But let’s separate for now	Because that’ll be less painfulYour now cold self is like this sigh, like this sigh	Even though there are so many of these piled up memories leftPetals of snow	They drifted down	And then disappearedI miss youI miss youHow much do I have to wish	How many freezing nights do I have to count	To be able to see you?	To be able to meet you?You know it all	You’re my best friend	Morning will come again	Because all nights and all seasons	Have an endThe cherry blossoms bloom	And the winter is about to end	I miss you	I miss you	If I can count out even just a couple of nights	I’ll go see you	I’ll go pick you upUntil the kind spring day that tells us the end of winter	Until the flowers bloom	I want you to stay, just like this	Just like thisTrans cr; Maya & Mari @ bts-trans© TAKE OUT WITH FULL CREDITS" True text
