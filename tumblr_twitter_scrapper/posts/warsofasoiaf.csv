warsofasoiaf 160659182901 "2017-05-14 15:17:36 GMT" http://warsofasoiaf.tumblr.com/post/160659182901/gaming-in-westeros-cards "Earlier, @nobodysuspectsthebutterfly tagged me about a question regarding card games as asked by @hermdoggydog. So let’s put on our worldbuilding hats and see what we can come up with.Card games have an appeal across classes, as they occupy a middle  ground which is less cerebral with a lower difficulty curve than board  games like chess and cyvasse, but are less fortune-based and more skill-based than dice games. And games form a key part of culture and stories, hence why the wandering gambler or the chess-playing strategist are both key tropes in storytelling.When it comes to designing a game, the key things in a card game is information asymmetry. That’s why in a two player game, usually there is a deck or pool of cards that are undealt so as to not give the players perfect information. Other things to think of are how many players, who deals, the sequence of play, and how you win. One thing that’s important is to include gambling and drinking, as these were an integral part of the history of card gamesSimple pub games would include variants of Old Maid, played with a full deck, one card removed, matching swords and clubs with cups and coins. The loser having to buy a round for the other players. You could see variants and names cropping up referencing bad rulers throughout history, a lone king of swords might be the sole unpaired card and that would be “drawing Maegor,” a lone queen of clubs might be “drawing Rhaenyra” whereas other regions might have a reference to an unpopular historical king as the odd man out. The Reach would probably have the 10 of cups as a reference to the weak Garth Graybeard, the Westerlands would call their game “Norwin’s Curse” and have the King of Coins as a satirical reference to Norwin Lannister, the joke being that the stingy King Norwin has to buy the rest of the players a round. Others include “Stranger’s Seven,” a variant of Crazy Eights where sevens become the wild card. Scoring variants of Stranger’s Seven would be as normal, and the pub variant would be that the winner gets a drink from the person with the most points. These games have the advantage of being incredibly easy to learn, thus players could leave and enter the game relatively quickly, and there would never be a shortage of people in the tavern to play.More complex games might involve matching games similar to Rummy, with sequence melds called “families” and match melds called “books.” The idea would largely be to go out of cards. Melding all cards would be given a suitable term, “Queen Aly’s Luck” or “Brandon’s Blessing” just as examples. Just like in Rummy, doing so would add score to the other players, but be hard to do.I could see cribbage variants being named after the various wars throughout history, especially with Blackfyre variants, with one player being ‘red’ or ‘Daeron’ and the other being ‘black’ or ‘Daemon.’ These games would have their variants suppressed shortly after the war, but they would still be played, or cited.  Gambling games would probably be closer to poker rather than baccarat or blackjack, because those types of games require a house dealer and we don’t really see casinos. Those would be comparison type games, with infinitely complex variations and bluffing. I could see the game being highly-prized in Dorne for their culture of military deception, but good bluffers would also be highly-prized in the Stormlands where their low numbers mean that shows of strength are important against the populous Reach. This, of course, would lead to a popular and possibly apocryphal story about a Dornish and Stormlander gambler, bonding over their hand, both spectacular bluffers who both had the lowest possible hands, to inevitably end in either comedy, when a border dispute turns out to both be amazing bluffs, or tragedy when neither recognize each other on the battlefield after seven years because both finally outbluffed the other.I could see even more complex games being played among the nobility, who have the time to learn opaque rules. Trick-taking games like contract bridge would probably be viewed under the context of a war, with partners being allied houses fighting for control of a disputed territory. For example, in the Riverlands, this game might be called “The Teats” while in other territories, it’s named after useful borderlands. In Dorne, for example, one team might be Salt and the other Stone (Sand would probably be avoided as that it is a bastard name) and the game called “The Wells.” I would imagine even a superstition around the game, if the first time two betrothed pairs play as partners and do well, their marriage would be considered particularly auspicious or lucky, conversely, if the two cannot play in sync, the marriage may be cursed with infighting.I would definitely think regional cards would probably have the highest symbol be the lord of the land. Westeros might call their red fool card a “Florian” and their black fool a “Mushroom,” and I would imagine that both cards would be, much like the Joker in our own world, wild cards, as Florian was as mighty as any knight or king when it came to his beloved Jonquil. In Dorne, following Aegon’s Conquest, the Fools would be Toland’s mad fool, and the other being Aegon I himself. Before the Conquest, I’d imagine the highest suit would be stylized after the sigil of the ruling king, with artwork stylized after depictions of famous figures. After the Conquest, the dragons would become the new highet sigil, with new decks of cards symbolizing moments in history. For example, when Aemma Arryn and Viserys I Targaryen were wed, I’d imagine the Queen of Dragons would have falcon motifs and resemble her, even though she’s a dragon-suited card. Bloodraven would burn any deck of cards that had a depiction of Daemon, whether as a king of dragons (seditious) or a knight of dragons, and would encourage cards depicting Baelor Breakspear as the knight of dragons with Daeron as the King (and perhaps himself as Knave). Given that not all decks were standardized until far later in our contemporary history, designing a single game would be impossible, but I can see variants of our own real-world games played throughout history.Thanks for the shout, Butterfly, and I hope you like the answer, Dog.SomethingLikeALawyer, Hand of the King" True text

So, I figured it was time to remedy that, with much help from @racefortheironthrone​. North House Ryswell: The Appendices for both AFFC and ADWD list Roger, Rickard, and Roose Ryswell as Lord Rodrik’s “quarrelsome cousins and bannermen” (though Theon in ADWD notes that Roger, Rickard, and Roose are Rodrik’s sons) House Manderly: Wyman Manderly tells Davos in ADWD that his “bannermen include a dozen petty lords and a hundred landed knights” Ramsgate and the Sheepshead Hills are definitely sworn to White Harbor, according to the app, but it’s unknown which families control them (though the Woolfields controlling one is a strong possibility, given the name of the family and the fact that a Woolfield is married to the current Manderly heir). It’s possible that the Lockes of Oldcastle and the Flints of Widow’s Watch are sworn to the Manderlys, as Wyman alleges he can deliver “all the lands east of the White Knife, from Widow’s Watch and Ramsgate to the Sheepshead Hills and the headwaters of the Broken Branch”.  However, in all relevant appendices the Lockes and this branch of House Flint are listed as primary bannermen of Winterfell, rather than bannermen of the Manderlys; Wyman’s words may only be suggesting his ability to influence his lordly neighbors, rather than a true liege-vassal relationship.  House Reed:  House Blackmyre (“Reek II”, ADWD) House Boggs (“Reek II”, ADWD) House Cray (“Reek II”, ADWD) House Fenn (“Reek II”, ADWD) House Greengood (“Reek II”, ADWD) House Peat (“Reek II”, ADWD) House Quagg (“Reek II”, ADWD) House Glover:  House Bole (“The King’s Prize”, ADWD) House Branch (“The King’s Prize”, ADWD) House Forrester (“The King’s Prize”, ADWD) House Woods (“The King’s Prize”, ADWD) Vale House Royce:  House Coldwater (AFFC Appendix) House Tollett (AFFC Appendix) House Shett of Gulltower (AFFC Appendix) House Corbray: in “Alayne II”, AFFC, Sansa thinks that “Corbray’s vassals” would be attending the wedding of Lord Lyonel and his Gulltown bride House Waynwood:  House Hardyng (“Alayne II”, AFFC)House Sunderland:  House Borrell (AFFC Appendix) House Longthorpe (AFFC Appendix) House Torrent (AFFC Appendix) Riverlands House Vance of Wayfarer’s Rest:  House Smallwood (“Arya IV”, ASOS)House Frey House Erenford (“Jaime VI”, AFFC) House Haigh (“Jaime VI”, AFFC) House Charlton (“Jaime VI”, AFFC) Harrenhal (presumably applicable for the duration of Harrenhal’s feudal holding) House Wode (“Jaime III”, AFFC) House Whent (formerly) (“The Riverlands: House Tully”, TWOIAF) Westerlands House Reyne: TWOIAF notes that “Lord Reyne reportedly laughed when his maester read him Ser Tywin’s edicts and counseled his friends and vassals to do nothing”.

House Cupps: speculative. Again, the name suggests a connection to the wine-drinking Arbor, and House Cupps being a vassal of the wealthy and powerful Redwynes might explain why the very powerful Leyton Hightower would allow his daughter Leyla to wed Ser Jon Cupps (especially as Leyla’s sister Denyse wed Ser Desmond Redwyne) Dorne House Yronwood  House Drinkwater: possibly if not probably. The app says that Gerris Drinkwater is a “knight sworn to Yronwood”, though this porbably only refers to Gerris being a household knight at Yronwood, as Gerris does not seem to be the head of House Drinkwater (since his twin sisters are called daughters, rather than sisters, of a landed knight). The House is not formally noted as a vassal of Yronwood in any Appendix, and only designated as a landed knightly House in the text, but in “The Spurned Suitor” Quentyn Martell thinks that he wants to “go back to Yronwood and kiss both of [Gerris Drinkwater’s] sisters”. This may suggest that the Drinkwater twins live on or near the Yronwood holdings, which would be sensible for daughters of an Yronwood bannerman.   House Jordayne (formerly) (“Ancient History: Ten Thousand Ships”, TWOIAF) House Wyl (formerly) (“Ancient History: Ten Thousand Ships”, TWOIAF) It’s possible that the Blackmonts and Qorgyles were also at one time Yronwood bannermen; Yandel writes that Nymeria and Mors Martell “struggled against Yronwood and his bannermen (the Jordaynes of the Tor, the Wyls of the Stone Way, together with the Blackmonts, the Qorgyles, and many more)”.

My mind went back to that man at Paris in 1919. He was a vigorous man then, splendidly made up in his fine dress uniform, medals and boots gleaming in the winter sun. He had been solid then, carved out of stone, vigorous and active when he spoke diplomats and generals alike. In those days his demeanor and bearing was severe without being aggressive; he was a man whose patience showed in his words but not his expression. He was a man of action who was out of his depth at a high table, yet who stubbornly refused to deliver anything less than the highest conduct in the tradition of his ancient nation.The man I looked upon now was at least ten kilos lighter, perhaps even fifteen. Makeup had attempted to hide the blackness under his eyes and the furrow in his brow, but it was as a pile of sand holding back the ocean. His skin sagged, and his knuckles were clenched white at all times, as if in silent protest. His expression was subdued, almost empty, yet behind his eyes there was a light of something, a barely burning candle. The Bull of Byzantium’s fire seemed only able to muster this half-a-man, this wispy specter who wore the mantle of an emperor. Seventeen years ago, he was a man who spoke and felt like one who could take on the world and win, yet now he was so very small, invisible save for the deference that others gave him. The purple had done what the Turks and the Germans together could not…grind this noble man down as a waterfall pounds the stones smooth. He that had stood against the hurricane of war with head proud, was now a step above a reed, tied to a stake to stand upright. When once he had been a Colossus, a man half above us mere mortals, now he was a shell, using every fibre of his being, simply to appear as we were. The contrast between that man and this one, was devastating.”" True text

We can get to greater specificity, because we know the standard ironborn longship is about one-third the size on average from the large Iron Fleet ships, so that runs about 30 men/ship, so 27,000 ironborn, plus the original 10,000 for a grand total of 37,000 men. Is it possible for the Iron Islands to field an army this large? A careful analysis of the text and some talk with @racefortheironthrone​ proves that they can’t, and indeed, they haven’t.The Ironborn Numbers Much is given of the claim “one thousand ships,” specifically in reference to the ancient ironborn, when Qhored Hoare boasted that his writ extended “wherever men can smell salt water or hear the crash of waves.” As the entire argument hinges on whether or not the Ironborn have the population to support such a large mobilized population, we have to look to see what the land can support.At first glance, it’s not promising. The Iron Islands are very small compared to the other lands of Westeros, and some of the smaller islands are uninhabited save by hardy sheep. Of the thirteen islands around Lonely Light, only one can support a household, the rest, according to the Worldbook, cannot do so. So it’s clear that all things being equal, the Iron Islands would support a far smaller population than either the Westerlands or the Riverlands, their neighbors who can field 40,000 troops. Furthermore, we are given direct evidence that the soil of the islands is poor, supporting a low population rather than a high one. “These cold, wet, windswept islands were never well forested, and their thin soil did not support the growth of weirwoods.”  “The soil of the Iron Islands is thin and stony, more suitable for the grazing of goats than the raising of crops.”  While a goat can survive on brush fodder, a human needs more nourishing fare. In fact, we see that while the “thousand ships” moniker is bandied about, a historical ironborn invasion, the Ironborn invasion of the Riverlands, has one hundred longships, not one thousand, and this was done after a long build-up. Qhorwyn Hoare had “tripled” his fleets, yet the inheritor of his kingdom, Harwyn. only sailed with 100 ships, roughly 3,000 men, after a long period of plenty. Even boom times don’t produce a large number of men for the ironborn navies.Clearly, a difference must be made up in men, in an artificially high population for that specific time period, in order to support the high numbers claimed. This is what MadeinMyr argues in his essay, saying: But the evidence actually points to the Iron Isles being significantly  overpopulated. This can be seen in the chronic land shortages and the  large number of itinerant priests.A quick look at the texts, however, supports the reverse, the ironborn have recently suffered an artificial dip in their population thanks to a recent war. Ten years past the Iron Islands were invaded by the mainland, in the failed Greyjoy Rebellion. We’re told from multiple sources that the devastating attack reached several islands, and that the Iron Fleet suffered a significant defeat at Fair Isle at the hands of Stannis Baratheon.When last he’d seen Lordsport, it had been a smoking wasteland.(Robert) smashed their fleet, burned their towns and broke their castles With his Wardens of the West and the North beside him, Robert forced landings on Pyke, Great Wyk, Harlaw, and Orkmont (Barristan Selmy) (l)ed the attack on Old Wyk during Balon Greyjoy’s Rebellion.This war hasn’t had even a generation to recover the devastating losses, inflicted on at least five of the seven major islands, including the most populated one, Harlaw. The buildings of Lordsport and the Iron Fleet might be rebuilt, but it takes time for young ironborn boys to grow up to become soldiers and sailors. Age cannot be rushed.Without clear, cited evidence to prove conclusively that the Iron Islands are significantly over-populated, we can dismiss the argument that the population of the Iron Islands is over-inflated. The Case of Balon’s Missing IronbornFurther supporting the idea that the Ironborn don’t have the numbers is that Balon’s thrust on the North is done with a substantially fewer number than a thousand ships, or even five hundred ships. Theon himself sees the Goodbrothers providing forty longships. The Goodbrothers are explicitly mentioned as one of major houses of Great Wyk, and one of the Greyjoy’s principal bannermen. This is further backed up in the text, as the Goodbrothers boast five cadet branches across multiple islands, yet they muster only forty ships. MadeInMyr offers an argument for why the great host of Greyjoy strength is not mustered to strike at the North in his campaign: Alternatively, in Clash of Kings Balon just has not had the time to  assemble his full strength and feels he has to strike the North now,  while he has the opportunity and element of surprise:..However, a quick glance at Theon’s chapters directly refute this claim:No one knew of his letter but Robb Stark…Still, Lord Balon was no fool either. He might have guessed why his son was coming home at long last, and acted accordingly.“(W)e are commanded not to speak of this to any man.”Given the secrecy, it’s clear that Balon has been preparing and hosting for a long time. Balon is not in a news vacuum, he is capable of receiving the news regarding what happens in the capital and can plan accordingly; he doesn’t act until the second novel, while Robb is forced to act halfway through the first. After all, even Eddard speaks of leveraging Theon as a means for Balon to use his fleet in the coming conflict, Balon is hardly ignorant that something is happening on the green lands. Clearly, not having the time to assemble his full strength cannot be the reason. Or worse, Balon never had the political capital to completely mobilize  the Iron Islands, with skeptical lords like Rodrik Harlaw and Baelor  Blacktyde giving their king as few men as they dared and more  self-interested lords holding back until they were more sure of the  war’s success. The second argument suggests instead that Balon, without the political clout needed to truly unite the Ironborn, is unable to get them to commit their full strength. Yet why? Balon was crowned as an iron king, his support by the traditionalists and the religious should be at an all-time high, as evidenced by Aeron’s absolute love for Balon which is couched in religious and cultural terms: My brother Balon made us great again, which earned the Storm God’s wrath… It shall be for us who remain behind in this dry and dismal vale to finish his great work.Moreover, we see that Victarion claims the lion’s share of captains at the kingsmoot before Euron’s appearance, so clearly there was a strong presence even after Balon’s death.  Asha was able to win roughly half of the Kingsmoot to her  program, indicating the Iron Islands were never strongly united behind  conquering the North. MadeInMyr uses this argument to state that this means that roughly half of the attendees at the Kingsmoot weren’t behind Balon, but this is a huge assumption. Assuming that the opinions of the Ironborn at the kingsmoot are the same as they were in the initial stages of A Clash of Kings is a critical error of analysis. As we see, Asha mentions such in her speech who she is courting:“And last, the gold of Winterfell.” From the third chest came yellow turnips, round and hard and big as a man’s head. They landed amidst the pebbles and the pinecones. Asha stabbed one with her dirk. “Harmund Sharp,” she shouted, “your son Harrag died at Winterfell, for this.” She pulled the turnip off her blade and tossed it to him. “You have other sons, I think. If you would trade their lives for turnips, shout my nuncle’s name!”Far from being the champion of an established pro-peace faction, Asha is courting those who supported the war at the outset who now question whether staying the course is the proper move. Even Baelor Blacktyde, who seeks to end the war at the Kingsmoot, is never mentioned as being opposed to the war in Clash, and Blacktydes come for Balon as he calls, just as the Harlaw vassals drink at Ten Towers yet the Reader acknowledges that this is merely war obligations; they may speak their will as is custom at the kingsmoot. This “anti-war” faction, never mentioned, is merely assumed to exist without evidence. Thus, the suggestion that Balon lacked the political will is not supported by the text, as there is no evidence of vassals and Lord Reapers holding their forces back.Who Then, Are the Ants at the Kingsmoot?Of course, then, we have to account for the large number of people at the kingsmoot. MadeInMyr is quite explicit, frequently citing this as proof of claim. “All who matter. The captains and the kings.” On the Iron Islands  they were one and the same, for every captain was a king on his own  deck, and every king must be a captain.  A thousand ants/voices means a thousand captains, which in turn means a thousand longships. Except we already know this isn’t the case, because Hake tells us so. “Seven of every ten families on the Iron Islands are fisherfolk. However mean and poor these men might be on land, upon the sea they are their own masters. “The man who owns a boat need never be a thrall,” Hake writes, “for every captain is a king upon the deck of his own ship.” So a thousand captains doesn’t mean, in turn, a thousand longships. It means 1000 ships, from the meanest fishing vessel to the magnificent Iron Victory, flagship of the Iron Fleet. ConclusionSo, we come to the truth of the matter. The Ironborn didn’t have a thousand longships at a time when they were more powerful, under Harwyn Hardhand, they don’t have the population to crew a thousand longships thanks to the limitations of their lands and the casualties of the Greyjoy Rebellion, and while every captain is a king upon his own deck, that does not turn a fishing boat into a warship.Now, hopefully, we can put this all to bed."

This is my rewrite of Jacaerys’ trip to the North and Vale, early in the Dance, to win their lords to Rhaenyra’s cause. Let me know what you think!The path Prince Jacaerys would take had been carefully planned, after much deliberation, by Prince Daemon and the Sea Snake. His brother Prince Lucerys had been sent to Storm’s End, where Rhaenyra confidently declared that “our good cousin” Lord Borros would welcome his kin and bend the knee to her. With his stepfather flying to Harrenhal to rally the querulous riverlords, Prince Jacaerys was charged to visit the Vale and North, which were yet undeclared for either party. Prince Jacaerys had suggested flying to Pyke as well, but the black council, in a rare unanimous decision, absolutely forbade it; Corlys Velaryon noted the dangers of the heir flying across a land either undecided or sworn to the Usurper, while Rhaenyra declared she would not risk her son among “the wild krakens” and Prince Daemon remarked that the ironborn “would not spend an hour listening to a prince if there were a town to be sacked or a maiden to be raped”. Lady Jeyne Arryn was a natural choice; not only was she kin to Rhaenyra through the late Queen Aemma Arryn, but the Princess Rhaenys held that “the Lady of the Eyrie will not fail to defend the rights of the Lady of the Seven Kingdoms”. Prince Daemon had initially declared the North “too remote” to be of use to them, but the Sea Snake countered that the North was crucial to victory, and would support Rhaenyra “as the Starks once supported the princess my wife”. Should they gain Riverrun and not Winterfell, he insisted, Lord Cregan might strike down from the Neck while the Hightowers rode up from the south, pinning the blacks on the Trident.  It was Lord Corlys who also insisted on Prince Jacaerys calling upon Lord Meryn Manderly at White Harbor. Lord Manderly was the richest of the Stark vassals, and with the wealth of the Hightower and Casterly Rock in the hands of the greens, the blacks needed the vaults full of silver White Harbor was said to control. On a gray morning shortly after his mother’s coronation, Prince Jacaerys,  now styled Prince of Dragonstone, saddled and mounted Vermax and set off from Dragonstone. Though the prince had never flown so far in his ten and five years, Vermax was a young and strong dragon, and Prince Jacaerys soon arrived in the Vale. Mindful of his grandfather’s desire to maintain the Velaryon blockade, he called first upon Lord Gerris Grafton of Gulltown and Ser Hugh Arryn, head of the Gulltown branch of House Arryn. Gulltown had not seen a dragon since Queen Visenya had burned the Arryn fleet during the Conquest, but Jacaerys pledged that “my mother is no Visenya, to win fealty with fire and blood”; Ser Hugh, in turn, replied that “Gulltown would never bend the knee to Vhagar or her rider”. At a feast celebrating the young prince’s visit, Lord Grafton announced that “Gulltown had always been a seat of honor” and that the prince and “his royal mother” should find “true friends” in his city (though in surviving records, the Graftons’ Maester Armen notes that even before the prince’s visit, Lord Gerris had remarked warily on the threat of the black dragons at nearby Dragonstone should House Grafton declare for the greens).From Gulltown Prince Jacaerys flew to the Eyrie, as Lady Jeyne and her household had not yet descended to the Gates of the Moon. When Prince Jacaerys landed in the Eyrie’s inner courtyard, the Lady of the Vale led her courtiers to greet “my sweet young cousin”. The nobles of the Vale marveled at the size and strength of Vermax, as well as the charming and decorous prince who rode him. Lady Jeyne feted Prince Jacaerys for two days, and on the third day of his visit proclaimed from her weirwood throne that Rhaenyra was the “rightful and true Queen of these Seven Kingdoms, our high and mighty sovereign”; she then bent the knee to Jacaerys and acknowledge him as “the lawful Prince of Dragonstone”.  It was recorded by Ser Justin Waynwood, then squire to Lord Steffon Corbray, in a letter to his betrothed that the Lord of Heart’s Home had privately urged the Lady of the Vale not to support a prince whose features bore “the stamp of bastardy”. Ser Justin’s letter makes no mention as to Lady Jeyne’s reply, but does note that the Lady of the Vale seated the prince and her young cousin Lorra Arryn together at every fete.Prince Jacaerys would have then flown directly from the Eyrie to Winterfell, but was instead caught in a storm over the Bite. Landing in Sisterton, the prince sought out the Sunderlands’ castle, calling for men to open your gates “for your prince has arrived and requires your aid”. Lord Matthos Sunderland then ordered his gates opened and received Prince Jacaerys and his dragon. The Lord of the Sisters proved somewhat unwilling to pledge his strength to the black cause, however, even when Prince Jacaerys insisted that “the Lady Jeyne your liege bent the knee to my royal mother”. The Sisters, Lord Matthos declared, had “long been ruled by sistermen kings”, and that “the law of succession was ever a matter of some debate”.  Lord Sunderland was willing, as he noted, to support a lawful queen, and then pointed to Lady Marla Sunderland, proclaimed Queen of the Three Sisters during the Conquest. Anxious not to have the pirates of the Sisters prey upon his lord grandfather’s fleet, Prince Jacaerys agreed that, in exchange for the Sisters’ fealty, he would present a petition from Lord Sunderland to his royal mother, including a town charter for Sisterton and greater rights for the sistermen to manage their own taxes and local laws. Once agreed, Lord Sunderland bent the knee to the prince, and Rhaenyra’s quartered standard was lifted into the stormy skies above Sweetsister.Having won the Eyrie and its vassals to his mother’s cause, Jacaerys flew Vermax to White Harbor, where Lord Meryn Manderly received him warmly.  “Once the dragon and the merman might have been bound by blood,” he declared, but now they “would be bound by sacred oaths of friendship”. Thereafter, Lord Manderly led the prince to the Sept of the Snows, where he and Jacaerys knelt before the Crone and prayed for her wisdom to guide the new queen. The Manderlys’ septon then anointed Prince Jacaerys with holy oils and proclaimed him “Prince of Dragonstone and Defender of the Faith”, and Lord Manderly swore upon a richly decorated and jeweled copy of the Seven-Pointed Star that he would “always uphold and defend the rights of the prince and his royal mother”. As proof of his leal service to Queen Rhaenyra, Lord Meryn insisted on sending his two eldest sons, Ser Torrhen and Ser Medrick, “to act as counselors for Her Grace”. Perhaps, as Ser Torrhen noted later in his copious notes of Rhaenyra’s brief reign, his lord father hoped that Rhaenyra would adopt one of the Manderly sons as her master of coin, a position as yet unfilled in Rhaenyra’s court (and, indeed, which would never be filled on the black council).Winterfell would be the last seat upon which the Velaryon prince would call. The Starks had once before welcomed dragons to Winterfell, when King Jaehaerys the Conciliator made his famed journey to the North, but the sight of Prince Jacaerys on Vermax still inspired awe among the denizens of the castle. Lord Cregan Stark solemnly welcomed the prince and maintained all the requirements of guest right, but refused to acknowledge Rhaenyra as queen. The Starks, he held, had acclaimed not Viserys and his line but the line of Princess Rhaenys at the Great Council, and had suffered “many tyrannies” at the hands of Targaryen kings. Unless Rhaenyra restored the New Gift to the control of Winterfell and allowed the Starks greater independence, Lord Cregan said, he would refuse to call his banners for her cause. Jacaerys’ charm refused to bend the iron will of the Lord of Winterfell. He pointed to the fearsome dragons under Rhaenyra’s control “which King Torrhen had been wise enough to heed”, but Cregan refused to be moved: “Loose your dragons upon the North and you will gain only blackened forests, while your enemies seize the rest of Westeros”. Eventually, prince and lord settled on an agreement, termed by later maesters the “Pact of Ice and Fire”: in return for Cregan’s pledge of the North’s levies to the black cause, Prince Jacaerys would set aside his betrothal to his cousin Princess Baela, and the princess would be wed either to the recently widowed Cregan or his young son and heir Rickon. The court fool Mushroom, in his Testimony of Mushroom, later maintained that Prince Jacaerys had agreed to the Pact not to make a future marriage but to validate a secret union between himself and Lyarra Snow, the bastard daughter of the late Lord Rickon Stark. According to Mushroom, Prince Jacaerys had been smitten with the tall and gray-eyed Lyarra, two years his elder, when she was bathing naked in one of the warm springs of Winterfell’s godswood. Mushrnoom further held that Jacaerys took the bastard girl’s innocence beneath the heart tree of the godswood, “shedding her maiden’s blood on the fallen red leaves of the weirwood”. Having deflowered Lyarra Snow, Jacaerys immediately thereafter swore to make her his wife, and covered her with his red and black cloak while she knelt before the heart tree. “When I am king, I will make you a trueborn Stark,” Jacaerys is alleged to have told his secret bride, “and then you shall be my queen.”  This account, however, must be dismissed as another colorful invention of the court fool (along with his argument that Vermax left a clutch of eggs in Winterfell’s crypts), as Mushroom did not accompany Jacaerys north, nor indeed was the prince noted to have spoken to the fool about it. Lyarra Snow herself disappears from the accounts of Winterfell’s maesters after the prince’s visit, although it must be remembered that many records of Lord Cregan’s rule were destroyed in the tumultuous reigns of his sons and grandson. In the years immediately after the Dance, fanciful tales arose of Lyarra, claiming that she joined the silent sisters in grief over the prince’s death at the Gullet, or that she became a courtesan in Lys famous for her wild northern beauty, or that she bore the prince’s son and thereafter fled east from Winterfell. Similar stories abounded about the identity of her supposed son by the prince, alleging that he became a captain of his own sellsword company, or a maester at the Citadel, or a master-at-arms at Karhold (the latter explanation favored by Maester Elys, maester at Castle Cerwyn in the reign of King Baelor the Blessed). None of these stories was ever verified, and their circulation appears to have ceased by the reign of King Daeron II. This is great, you can see the strengths and weaknesses of Jace on display, a great exploration of feudal diplomacy, and it’s just a fun read to boot.-SLAL" False text

This is an expansion of the short thing I had on the Battle of Cannibal Pass earlier. Let me know what you think.Lord Jason Lannister had assembled his mighty host at Casterly Rock, and - having remarked that “the gold dragon has no truer friend than his brother lion” - marched along the River Road to attack the rebellious Riverlords. The Riverlands was notoriously divided even after Daemon Targaryen marched against the Brackens at the Burning Mill, and Jason believed that the surest path to success would be to break the Riverlanders early, eroding Rhaenyra’s support on the continent. While many in the Lannister host were wary of engaging the Rogue Prince upon his fearsome Blood Wyrm, Daemon soon turned his attention back to the east. The Riverlords thereafter began to expect an attack and consolidated their forces in lines, the closest being near the Golden Tooth, where the Westerlander advantage in manpower would have a lessened effect. The Lannister advance was slowed by the intense heat, rumored to be as hot as any on record despite the approach of autumn, which ignited brush fires throughout the wooded Riverlands. Yet for the Westerlander troops, their morale was reported to be at an all-time high, as they outnumbered their prospective foes at least two-to-one. When battle was joined, the chivalry of the West charged the Riverlander infantry, splitting their lines in twain and scattering them “as waves on the surf” wrote Robert Kayce, who had previously been Lord Jason’s squire, but whose abysmal prowess with the sword relegated him to the role of Lord Jason’s chronicler and whose tales form our most complete account of this theater.Yet while the Riverlander lines did break, Lord Jason elected to keep pursuit, urged on to strike at the nobles in the rear. During this pursuit, a common-born man named Pate of Longleaf took a fallen spear from one of Lord Piper’s routed retinue and drove the point through Lord Jason’s gorget with such force that Pate snapped the haft of his weapon in two places. Pate was already famous among the Longleaf populace for his great strength - it was said that he could straighten a horseshoe with his bare hands - and had come to the attention of his local lord, who offered him the position of squire to his younger brother. Unkind rumors suggested that Pate’s churlish speech and feats of strength were a source of rude entertainment among the riverlords, and that they had earned him the position of squire, and Mushroom spoke that the real reason for his appointment was that he “put horses to shame, and pleasured Lady and Lord Smallwood both.” Yet now, Pate was exalted for slaying Lord Jason, and shortly after the battle, he was knighted with the castle-forged blade he had taken from Lord Jason’s body. The survivors of the Golden Tooth were in great adoration of Pate’s feat, and they heeded his command to withdraw east to the land of Lords Chambers and Piper, who would provide support With the death of Lord Jason Lannister, the command of the Westerlander contingent fell into question. There was no Lannister to lead them: Jason’s sons - the new Lord Lancel and his younger brother Leo - were boys of nine and seven, and his only brother Ser Tyland was still serving in King’s Landing. Of the knights in the Westerlander host, Ser Adrian Tarbeck was a close friend of Lord Jason, and in times when Westerlander levies were called upon, Lord Jason oft selected Ser Adrian to command his center. The two had, according to Ser Adrian, declared themselves sworn brothers as a testament to their firm friendship, and Jason had even spoken of wedding his sister to Ser Adrian. This claim could not be verified by any contemporary observer (and Lady Jacquetta was eventually wed to Lord Prester), but the friendship between Lord Jason and Ser Adrian has been well-documented among multiple chroniclers and maesters. Ser Adrian asserted that he should take command “until such time as His Grace names a new Warden”. Lord Lyman Lefford, however, fiercely contested this declaration. The Lord of Golden Tooth had been young during the long reign of the Old King, and had taken command after his father had died in a most embarrassing fashion.  To hear the singers, the corpulent Lord Gerwin had his lordly seat crack from his weight, and his head struck his table, breaking his neck instantly. However, according to the records of House Lefford compiled by Maester Myles, Lord Gerwin was determined to have died of overexertion of the heart, and had fallen over dead at his table at his second dinner. Regardless, the jeers spurred by this humiliation was said to have inspired Lord Lyman, in his youth, to acts of reckless bravado in an attempt to prove the strength of House Lefford.    When King Jaehaerys had expanded the River Road from Riverrun to Casterly Rock, merchant caravans and tax wagons often found themselves preyed upon by mountain bandits, who used the cave systems and high ridges adjoining the road to ambush their targets. Lord Lyman immediately pronounced that he would “roust these rats from their warrens” and launched a punitive expedition against them. His retinue in their fine castle-forged steel were tremendously successful, but in his final push he overextended himself and took a wound just below the groin in his left thigh, which troubled him to the end of his days. Lord Lyman walked slowly, but was still able to ride though it vexed him greatly. Afterwards, Lord Lefford was known to be a cautious commander who desired to use his cavalry upon the flanks to prevent overextension.Lord Lyman argued that he was the oldest lord present, and that Ser Adrian was unfit for senior command. Ser Adrian was also a mere knight, only a cousin to old Lord Tarbeck, not blessed to order lords into battle without a direct appointment from Ser Tyland or the recently-widowed Lady Johanna, regent for her son. While Ser Adrian defended himself admirably, the one barb that he could not refute was that it had been he who helped urge Lord Jason on his charge, and that shame was his to bear. Cowed, the assembled lords and knights shouted ayes for Lord Lyman. Both men, it is said, were courteous to each other after, with Ser Adrian being offered command of the van in consolation.In truth, the wily Lord Lefford was perhaps the best choice for the theater. Lord Blackwood’s levies had hoped to march quickly to reinforce the men at the Golden Tooth. In their haste, they had neglected to use their outriders fully, and old Lord Lefford was quick to take advantage. On the River Road, where the foothills of the Golden Tooth and the woods of the western Riverlands mix to make the road troublesome, the Westerlanders descended upon the Blackwood army that had recently been victorious at Stone Hedge and slew seven in ten men. The singers now refer to that battlefield as Cannibal Pass, for the ravens that were said to feast upon Blackwood noble and peasant alike, including proud Lord Lucas, whose lordship passed to his young son and heir, Benjicot. -SLAL" True text

Far from being one of the smartest players in the game of thrones, Doran, in my opinion, is one of the worst strategists in the series who has categorically failed to reverse Robert’s Rebellion and restore House Targaryen to the Iron Throne (and House Martell to royal favor). I wanted to use this essay to highlight Doran’s plans and where in each he failed to undertake the logical steps necessary to complete those plans. Doran does not merely pretend to be the grass, soft to walk on but hiding the viper - he is the grass, blown by passionate winds yet unable to stir itself to action. Hope you like! The Queen Regent (NFriel)  Amen! Couldn’t agree more with you throughout <3 Doran’s not a chessmaster, he’s a tragic character whose story is driven by his mistakes and blind spots. Quentyn’s story made this so heartbreakingly clear:  He felt as though he might be sick. What am I doing here? Father, why? Four men dead in as many heartbeats, and for what? “Fire and blood,” he whispered, “blood and fire.” I said the other day that this is such a perfect, powerful deconstruction of the final moments of “The Princess in the Tower.” When Doran whispered “fire and blood,” it seemed like a triumph…but by the time Quentyn repeats it, moments before his unimaginably painful death, we’ve seen how terrible Doran’s plan was, and the doom to which it has confined Quent (hence the Hell imagery throughout the latter’s chapters).   Aww! Tumblr friends liking things! <3 you back!What’s so sad about the whole Quentyn affair, besides everything, is that it is so avoidable. There was everything Doran could have done about Quentyn’s journey, such that no one needed to die. But no. He trusts a son with no demonstrable charisma or political shrewdness, who has only ever known a life of relative ease and privilege, to lead a dynastically unimpressive band on an unclear and wild itinerary across a war-torn region, all in the hope that a dragon-owning woman he does not know, who is a queen in her own right, will comply with the dictates of a decade (or more) old precontract between a dead man and another woman. Failure is literally not an option; there is no Plan B for any of the variants that could have altered the course (i, say, Daenerys had been overthrown in the interim, had died of natural causes, had freaking been married to someone else). Quentyn was doomed from the moment he passed under Yronwood’s portcullis, had he but known it.Completely agree with that quote. Damn! I should have used it. Would have been a nice bookend.

The more I looked into it though, the more it became clear that the Peakes, while certainly ambitious, were no worse in most situations than those they were fighting.So here’s a new look at the Peakes - not as a good family, not as secret heroes, but as a family that maybe deserves a little more than simply “villain” status. Hope you enjoy!The Queen Regent (NFriel)" True link

In this series, BryndenBFish and I will examine a number of individuals who may press blood claims to different Westerosi seats, and the arguments and tactics different plotters may use to install these pawns as great rulers.The first of these pawns we’ll be looking at is Tyrek Lannister. Though a comparatively minor character, Tyrek’s mysterious and very thorough disappearance continues to inspire debate over his fate. In this essay, I want to suggest that Tyrek might be in fact alive and (mostly) well, waiting to make a dramatic reappearance in Westeros, schooled and prepared by an unlikely “ally.”Thanks for reading! The Queen Regent (NFriel)" True link

It’s one I’ve been meaning to write for a little while, and then just decided “Eh, fuck it, I’ll just sit down and do it.” So I did! “The Rogue Prince” is fascinating to me, because I simply adore ASOIAF history. I like talking about it, I like writing about it, I just like it, And while there are definitely problems with that story (the Hand and I are in agreement that “The Princess and the Queen” actually would have made a better title for that story, since the pretense of focusing on Daemon was dropped like that spooky 90s plush Hot Potato game), I really liked these murder mysteries that are presented. It’s nice to have a way to engage the story, to try to figure something out that is ultimately unknowable (unless GRRM says something different). With Jon Arryn, we got an answer to that eventually; but with poor Laenor and the Strongs, the only answer is the one you as a reader thinks makes the most sense. I tried to present the cases as logically as possible, to come to the best conclusion, but there are no right answers here, and that’s what makes them fun.Enjoy!The Queen Regent (NFriel)" True link

I love Christmas a lot – always have. I love decorating my little geeky tree, I love making house sigil snowflakes for my window, I love hanging with my family (my brother-in-law brings his Nintendo 64 on Christmas Eve and we play all kinds of Mario Kart and GoldenEye). It’s just a really nice, magical time for me.But I also love you guys. Not in a sappy way, but I know that this blog, the Tumblr, the podcasts – none of that would mean much of anything if we didn’t have fans like you all reading, listening, commenting, and generally being awesome. It’s really awesome to be able to engage in the fandom as we do here at Wars and Politics, and I can say that the vast majority of interactions I’ve had with my work on here have been wonderfully positive and enhanced my experience of the series.So I wanted to do something nice for you all – a little Christmas present, as it were (or a present for whatever holiday you celebrate – if nothing else, today is National Eggnog Day). For the past – eh, more time than you want to know – I’ve been transcribing our very first podcast episode, “I Come Not to Praise Rhaegar Targaryen”. If any of you have ever transcribed video or audio, you know how fun it can be, and I am by no means a professional at this. There were moments I could not for the life of me make out what was being said (even from me!), so I made a best guess; for a 90 minute podcast, I think I did a pretty good job. So if you’re hearing-impaired – if you’re a visual rather than an audio learner – if you want to read along like those books-on-tape we used to have in my library, where the book and the tape came in a cute little bag together – any reason at all, you’re welcome to enjoy this transcript.I hope you all have a merry Christmas, and if you celebrate a different holiday, I hope you have a wonderful time as well. Enjoy the season and have a safe and happy 2016!The Queen Regent (NFriel)" True link

Things are wrapping up at Wars and Politics of Ice and Fire Headquarters (it’s right between the Baxter Building and Fisk Towers) - in fact, I believe this is the last essay for 2015 from all of us. It won’t be the last bit of content, oh no: we have two (!) podcast episodes to release before Earth finishes its lap around the Sun, and a bunch of goodies next week (including a Christmas present from yours truly).Still, it’s Brandon we’re talking about today.   Though Brandon is often remembered for his hot-headedness and typically Stark “wolfsblood”, it is equally important to note just how southron in his training and customs the heir to Winterfell had become by the time he died. His honor was a wolf’s honor – southron in its principle but Northern in its fury – and it was that volatile mix of influences which led Brandon to his death.  On a terribly sentimental note, I’ve adored writing for the blog in the past year, and a huge percentage of the reason I’ve liked it is because of you, the fans. We wouldn’t be a blog-podcast if we didn’t have people reading and commenting and interacting (or we would, but it would be totally lame). You all make it rad, and I’m happy to have found my little spot in this fandom. So thanks for reading my stuff, hope you like it, and stay tuned in 2016!" True link

This essay’s been around 8 months in the making, and it’s an excellent conclusion to the tale of glory and madness that was the Targaryen royal dynasty. Aerys II began his rule a bright young prince, full of promise, but ended it a monstrous, paranoid tyrant, as far as could be from his Conqueror ancestor. This is a wonderful essay (and perhaps I’m biased, but it’s true), and I couldn’t imagine a more fitting conclusion to this piece of The Three Heads of the Dragon.The Queen Regent (NFriel)" True link

It seems weird that the Three Heads of the Dragon series is coming to a close - we’ve been writing it since April, and I feel like I’ve been involved in it forever. All good things and such, I guess. I’ve really enjoyed it, and I’ve especially enjoyed having such great feedback from the fandom about it, so thank you, you guys.And now for something just terribly sad: Queen Rhaella. There is something just so profoundly sorrowful about her life. It’s as though Rhaella somehow incurred the wrath of Fate, and spends essentially her whole life (at least since around 14) being dogged by cruelty. And yet, Rhaella never did anything wrong. There was no great tragic flaw in Rhaella, something heaven was punishing her for. She simply drew the worst possible lot she could (for her circumstances, at least). Every moment that life goes to give her the smallest bit of comfort, it’s snatched away from her. She endures so much in life, mostly without complaint (and for the one time she is recorded to have complained, I think everyone will agree she had more than a right to). She watches the collapse of everything she’s ever relied on - a stable marriage, a role as royal mother, her kingdom itself - and dies, leaving her young children to the vicissitudes of a fate which had been so cruel to her.Well. What a cheerful bright note to end this on. Read it like comment subscribe, that sort of thing.The Queen Regent (NFriel)" True link

He looks at why reformers don’t always succeed with wide-ranging visions and why Jaehaerys II might be considered one of the better Targaryen Kings. There is also a wonderful analysis of the War of the Ninepenny Kings, so all in all you all definitely need to read this." True link

Certainly, there’s much about Viserys that makes him villainous: petty, cruel, ignorant, and vicious, Viserys is remembered as a fool and a poor would-be king not merely by readers but by the characters who knew him. He’s not a good person, and his abuse of Daenerys over years of exile cannot be justified or condoned. Nevertheless: there is a way in which we can understand, I think, the nuanced tragedy which was Viserys’ life that does not excuse the monster he became later. By the age of eight he’s lost his father, mother, brother, and kingdom, and was spirited away, never to see the only home he’d ever known again. After Willem Darry’s gallant if insufficient regency of a few years, Viserys is alone in Essos with his sister; he’s watched but never aided by the men interested in him, and instead finds himself rejected at every turn for help to regain a crown to which he was only lately taught he was the rightful heir. His end is tragically pathetic; he’s given a moment to think he’s gained everything he ever fought for, only to be fatally disillusioned, and the last thing he sees is Daenerys, his only family left, making no move to stop her husband giving him his “rightful” crown.The Queen Regent (NFriel)" True link
