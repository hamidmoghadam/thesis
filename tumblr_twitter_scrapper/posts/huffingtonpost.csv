Affectionate, loving and present‚Ä¶ somehow people fail to realize this exists,‚Äù photographer Zun Lee told The Huffington Post. ‚ÄúSeeing black people just being is a powerful act.‚Äù Too many archetypes of black fathers in the media portray these men as aggressive and absent. To combat these notions, Lee focuses his work on the various complexities of black fatherhood. Over the last four years, Lee has produced more than 12,000 photos, all of them based on black fatherhood. His work features some of the most intimate images of fatherhood that, collectively, send a strong message that pushes back against the negative assumptions about black fathers. ‚ÄúBlack people are expected to be supernatural and it‚Äôs a dangerous narrative and I‚Äôm rebelling against that. For us to be respectable, we have to perfect,‚Äù Lee said. ‚ÄúMany men fall through the cracks. Many of these men aren‚Äôt married or live at home but these very men negotiate the notion of presence in a very meaningful way.‚Äù Lee, a biracial man who had a rocky relationship with his own father, grew up around black men who helped discipline and raise him as a child, Lee said. For him, these men became father figures and inspired him to continue creating work that challenges the portrayal of fatherhood in a very fluid and realistic way. ‚ÄúBlack fathers are no different than other fathers,‚Äù Lee said. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need to owe an explanation or say that we deserve better treatment, we are not criminal. We don‚Äôt have to prove anything to anyone. We are human. We‚Äôre not on trial here.‚Äù Whether his work captures a father‚Äôs long, loving gaze to his child, or their hands clasped to symbolize protection and presence, Lee‚Äôs focus on these specific moments of love and affection is what makes his imagery so relatable. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not here to refute, explain or justify anything,‚Äù Lee said. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt get it, it‚Äôs fine.

That means Coloradans may each get their own cut of the $50 million in recreational pot taxes collected in the first year of legal weed. It‚Äôs a situation so bizarre that it‚Äôs gotten Republicans and Democrats, for once, to agree on a tax issue.Even some pot shoppers are surprised Colorado may not keep the taxes that were promised to go toward school construction when voters legalized marijuana in 2012.

The legislation would guarantee maternity and paternity leave with pay not just for employees at federal agencies, but also for staffers inside the halls of Congress.Though it may surprise many Americans, each congressional office currently acts as its own fiefdom when it comes to paid leave for employees. The Family and Medical Leave Act guarantees congressional staffers 12 weeks of unpaid leave with a new child, but the members themselves get to decide how much paid time off their staffers receive. The generosity inevitably varies from office to office.

When the teacher described erections as often pleasurable, I was stunned. I also wondered what wacky shift in my own body would bring similar pleasure. Something good must happen to females, right? Finally, a woman appeared on the screen! Then‚Ä¶ tampons. Maxi pads. Facts about the cramps, bleeding and bloating I would experience for one-quarter of my fertile life. It seemed unfair, and it was. Throughout the remainder of my sex education, female sexual pleasure was never explored ‚Äì a far too common scenario.¬† On my sexuality radio show and podcast, I often ask guests and listeners what they learned about sex early on. Most women tell me they either learned nothing or that sex is dirty, sinful and ‚Äúslutty.‚Äù One woman told me she stopped trying to orgasm because she‚Äôd tried and ‚Äúfailed.‚Äù Lots of women don‚Äôt, she said, so what‚Äôs the big deal? We learn about sexual pleasure through experience, but typically not until we‚Äôve learned myths that can hinder it. Images of sex better suited to mainstream porn are splashed about the media, suggesting that we must look and act unrealistic ways to feel and appear sexy, while actual porn promotes unrealistic notions of sex commonly perceived as fact. While guys think with their penises, we‚Äôre taught, many gals would rather fake an orgasm to get sex over with or cry ‚Äúheadache!‚Äù to bypass it. When we have sex, there‚Äôs a significant chance we won‚Äôt experience orgasm. That‚Äôs what many headlines suggest, after all. So it must be true, right? Thankfully, no. Many headlines and statistics cited throughout the media regarding female sexuality, I‚Äôve learned, derive from myths or studies that are outdated, misinterpreted or blown way out of proportion. Here are just a few common examples. For all three myths go here." True link
