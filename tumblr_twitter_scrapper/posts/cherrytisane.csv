Gary / palletshipping family fic I’ve been thinking of writing.  Context: Ash volunteers to babysit whenever Gary is needed in the lab. Sammy, the baby,  is named after Samuel Oak :D “When was the last time you went out on a date, Gary?” Tracey enquires suddenly, rearranging the test tubes idly to keep himself busy. He relabels those that show wear and tear and arranges them by date. The light clinking of glass echoes throughout the lab.Gary pauses, his fingers lingering over the keys of his laptop as his brain attempts to comprehend what his friend has just asked him. “I date,” Gary furrows his brow, and decides to stretch out the horrible kink forming in his neck from being stationary all day. The resounding pop fills the silence in the room. Gary sighs in relief and rolls his shoulders.Tracey stares at him with a raised eyebrow. “Mostly carbon,” Gary admits sullenly, and then further argues, “I just don’t have time. Between research and Sammy, my days are full.” A loud giggle breaks their conversation. Gary and Tracey turn to look through the pane of glass separating the lab from the garden to observe the source of the noise. Ash sits crossed legged on a blanket, Sammy sitting in his lap. He leans down and blows a loud raspberry on Sammy’s stomach, causing the infant to squeal and giggle, his chubby limbs flailing excitedly. In protest, Sammy grabs an inky lock of Ash’s hair and pulls. ""Sammy! Ouch!“ Ash cries out, trying to unwind the infant’s fingers from his hair with no luck. Sammy pulls harder, giggling. The corners of Gary’s mouth quirk up in a small contented smile at his rivals dismay. Tracey notices the smile, the fondness in Gary’s eyes and casually mentions, “You know, if you were to ask him out, he’d say yes.” Gary freezes slightly but doesn’t turn away from the sight of Ash, now free of Sammy’s clutches, tickling his son in revenge. Sammy’s giggles are loud as his tiny hands bat away Ash’s larger ones unsuccessfully. “You sure about that?” Gary jokes slightly, not allowing his insecurity to taint his words. Tracey smiles, and places a reassuring hand on Gary’s shoulder, “I know Ash. He loves Sammy. He’s always loved you - anyone can see that.” Ash, finished with his tickle torture, cuddles Sammy close to his chest rubbing his nose against the infants, wide grins on both their faces. Sammy sticks his fingers up Ash’s nose and lets out a large squeal as Ash splutters.Gary can hear Ash’s cry of “Sammy why!?” and stifles his laughter behind a hand. Tracey pushes further, “You two need to stop dancing around each other.”It’s in that moment that Ash looks up and notices Tracey and Gary watching from the glass pane. He waves enthusiastically at them, smiling wide and bright. Sammy sticks the hand that was previously up Ash’s nose into Ash’s mouth. The look of horror on  Ash’s face causes a short burst of laughter to escape from Gary,  before he hides his amusement away and composes himself, smirking.  Ash narrows his eyes at Gary, a silent declaration of I saw you laugh, you jerk!Gary turns in his chair, breaking away from the scene outside, warmth spreading through his chest. There’s a slight blush on his cheekbones, “You’re right Tracey. I’ll ask him to dinner.” Gary pauses uncertainly, despite already knowing the answer he asks, “Ash… he likes dinner, right?” Tracey will forever cherish this moment.“Ash definitely likes dinner, and will say yes to dinner,” Tracey smirks as he adds on, “maybe there will be breakfast involved too if you’re lucky.”Gary nearly throws his laptop at Tracey for his implication."

And whilst my intentions are not predatory in the least, I want everyone to feel safe in thier online environment. If y'all don’t want me, a grown ass adult to be following you; that is okay. This is supposed to be your safe space. Please know that its okay if y'all wanna ask me politely to unfollow. I won’t be offended- I am completely aware of the age gap and I want y'all to feel comfortable. And to my fellow older peeps- if you get offended when a 13-15ish person asks you to hit unfollow? Y'all should probably ask yourselves why that is the case. These are kids we’re talking about. We should want them to feel safe. Aight. With that out of the way, feel free to go on your merry way.  It’s important to add: you don’t have to ask politely. Just ask. Or block, whatever works best for you. It’s not a minor’s job to coddle their adult followers. Not at all.  Extremely important for everybody to know  Yes, please feel free to unfollow me or to ask me to unfollow you if this is makes you feel uncomfortable at all!  Same. I am damn near 25 and totes understand if that would freak out or otherwise make any younger folk uncomfortable. Feel free to block me or shoot an ask for an unfollow if ya need or even just want me to.  I have no issues with unfollowing any blogs that are uncomfortable with me following them because of my age.  I’m almost 25 so just let me know. No harm, no foul.  Related, if you’re an adult and feel uncomfortable with minors following you where they may see content that you don’t want them see, unfollowing and blocking goes both ways.  You always have the right to curate your blog and who you let follow you. " False text

The choice of wealthy white couples to implant embryos in the bodies of brown women is seen, not as colonialist exploitation, but as a neutral consumer choice. I can’t help wondering why, if the fate of the fictional Offred is so horrifying to western feminists today, the fate of real-life women in surrogacy hostels is causing so little outrage. I suppose the main argument of these feminists would be that real-life women choose to be surrogates, whereas Offred does not. But is the distinction so clear? If Offred refuses to work as a handmaid, she may be sent to the Colonies, where life expectancy is short. Yet even this is a choice of sorts. As she herself notes, “nothing is going on here that I haven’t signed up for. There wasn’t a lot of choice but there was some, and this is what I chose.” In the real world, grinding poverty drives women of colour to gestate the babies of the wealthy. As one Indian surrogate tells interviewer Seemi Pasha, “Why would I be a surrogate for someone else if I don’t need the money? Why would I make myself go through this pain?” Definitely a good read/critique of liberal feminism  I had no idea this was a thing holy shit " False link

cherrytisane 159977609768 "2017-04-25 14:51:14 GMT" https://cherrytisane.tumblr.com/post/159977609768/why-does-drug-resistance-readily-evolve-but "drferox: animalsustainability:  Ever wondered why people are a lot more concerned about antibiotic resistance than vaccine resistance? Ever wondered why vaccines are one of our most important tools in the fight of disease and the prevention of more drug-resistant strains?  This article does a great job of explaining how and why vaccine resistance is less of a threat, and why vaccines are so important to preserving the efficacy of what drugs we do have available. Some Key Points  Vaccines act earlier than antibiotics, meaning they can limit microbe replication and mutation sooner Vaccination suppresses peak microbial population size even if microbes try to infect the system (by 2-5 orders of magnitude in a rodent tuberculosis model, for example) Vaccines severely reduce the opportunities for new drug resistant / vaccine resistant strains to arise or spread once arisen Vaccines expose the immune system to a wide variety of potential pathogen proteins and binding sites, expanding the amount of pathogen-associated patterns the immune system can recognize. “This means that immunity in effect is acting like combination therapy” This is especially effective where the potential patterns of a pathogen are constrained by evolution, limiting the number of patterns that could slip through the immune system’s surveillance  Where vaccine resistance has evolved, it was because one of the benefits identified in the article failed, such as where mutation leads to further patterns that were not vaccinated against by the vaccine, or where new strains not included in the new vaccine have arisen, sometimes due to small mutations in the genetic code leading to large effects on the microbe’s ability to escape detection (like some pertussis strains), or because the initial vaccine was able to prevent disease from getting worse, but unable to completely prevent infection and transmission.  Current vaccine research is working hard on addressing these issues  When serotype (distinct strain) is vaccinated against, the serotype may be replaced in the population by another, which vaccines do not grant immunity to, requiring the development of a new vaccine. While some vaccines protect against multiple serotypes (or all known serotypes of a disease), and most vaccines remain very effective, current research is ongoing to understand how serotype diversity changes in response to vaccination so better vaccines can be created.  “  We have argued that drug resistance has tended to evolve faster than vaccine resistance because, for the most part, drugs are used therapeutically whereas vaccines are used prophylactically, and drugs attack far fewer target sites than do vaccines. This means that drug resistance is more likely to arise in the first place and then spread more rapidly once it has arisen. By contrast, vaccines prevent infection and transmission and induce immunity against many pathogen target sites, making it hard for vaccine resistance to evolve. In the electronic supplementary material, appendix, we show that together, both features have a substantially stronger impact than either alone. The few examples of vaccine-associated evolution detected in human and animal pathogens have occurred against vaccines that lack the benefits of one or both of these features.  “ (tagging @why-animals-do-the-thing @seananmcguire @drferox in case they are also interested - this seems up their respective alleys)   Honestly this is such a neat article I recommend reading it in its entirety, as it goes into a lot of the differences in action and efficacy between vaccines and antibiotics, and how we can use this going forward to make both vaccines and drugs better.   It’s worth noting that it’s theoretically easier to make a new vaccine too. Target pathogen has evolved so it’s surface proteins have changed? Take the new strain, process it like you did the old one, and you have a new vaccine for that serotype. We can use the same methods to create vaccines again and again. We can’t do that repeatedly for anti-biotics. " False link
