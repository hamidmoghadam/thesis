This was in 2002-2003 when people were hyper-patriotic and nationalistic, slightly more than you see today (though still maddening today). Anyway, I got sent to the principle’s office and so on and so forth, and teachers and administrators wanted to punish me. However, thanks to a law teacher, I was well educated. If you decide to sit, please keep in mind Tinker vs. Des Moines. That is a Supreme Court law  that states students do not relinquish their Constitutional rights when they enter school. This means you have the freedom to protest, as long as it’s peaceful and not disruptive to school, such as wearing an armband or sitting for the pledge. They cannot force you to stand, and they cannot punish you. That would be unconstitutional. Do not be deterred in any peaceful protest. You are allowed to have your voice, anyone that that says otherwise is full of shit and doesn’t know the law.  I sat for the pledge all of 8th grade. But the first time, the teacher next door came over and yelled at me for “making a scene”. So the next day I brought in my fucken student handbook that SAYS IN PRINT students may sit or stand while reciting the pledge OR saying nothing at all. That asshole. Then he had the audacity to call me out in front of the class “Why won’t you say the pledge huh? Religious reasons? Did your parents tell you not to?”  I literally said, because I don’t have to. Because I LITERALLY DO NOT HAVE TO. It’s my right and I will take it.  Look sit during the pledge or whatever, just know it’s really pretty disrespectful.My brother is out putting his life on the line for you ungrateful people. The least you could do is stand up. If not for your government, then for the men and women that are dying for you.  No. Stop this nonsense of calling people ungrateful for sitting for a pledge. The Pledge of Allegiance isn’t about soldiers fighting “for us.” The Pledge is a creepy, indoctrinating ritual that hasn’t even been around the entirety of this country.  I’m not even getting into all the issues with the miliary industrial complex. But stop being conned into thinking that the Pledge is somehow about your brother.  You can be critical of this government and the military without being critical or individual soldiers. This idea that we need to do something because it is “disrespectful” to someone that has nothing to do with it is ridiculous.  You think all these people don’t have family in the military? Or that some of these people might be in the military? I know people in the military that sat for the Pledge. Because they knew the Pledge wasn’t about them.  Sitting for the Pledge can also be an act of patriotism as well. It’s an act of peaceful protest. listen my military friends sit My military friends THANKED ME for SITTING because they’re pretty fucking done with a country that sends them off to murder random brown people Because Patriotism or whatever stop using military folk as a strawman they’re people with lives too anyway, in 2003, I was a 3.5 average student (not quite straight-A because ADHD, but my teachers knew this and accepted this) and I happened to have teachers in 2nd period (when the pledge was) who let me sit my cool ass with my cowboy hat (also Very Not Allowed in American Schools) (Hats in general, not specifically cowboy hats) (I am in whiteass suburbia on the East Coast btw where cowboy hats are unusual) in the front fucking row reading books while the Pledge happened because  1. They knew me and knew that beyond this I was an Upstanding Citizen and 2. Most of them, being in Liberal-Ass Montgomery County Maryland, aka one of the richest whiteass best public school systems in the country, all secretly agreed with me PS: Pledge is a fairly recent jingoistic bullshit invention and only made officially part of public school in the ‘50s in reaction to the Red Scare, eg, it originates out of fear of the Russians. Y’know, the folks who our Esteemed Leader is sucking off constantly.   I did NOT serve for 8.5 years just some punk ass can use me or my brethren in arms to SHAME fellow citizens for following both their conscience and exercising their Constitutional FUCKING RIGHTS! Folks like that tumble-weed fucker can get right the fuck off with their bullshit jingoism.   im just gonna point to this post by doncoyote here now  big hugs dude " False text

I have been in fandoms where shipping wars happened. I have seen people sending hate to each other and others getting hurt. In order to write a good romance with a good story, in my opinion, the intended characters need to have a good amount of interactions over a suggested long period of time. The romance should not take over the plot. It should go hand in hand with the plot. It cannot happen all of a sudden in one episode. I accept all sorts of relationships. You just cannot have two characters be together just for the aesthetics. You cannot assume those do not like the ship, to actually want a same-sex ship. That’s like assuming apple to actually be an orange. Why can we not act civil towards another? We as the fans, can accept what the creator has in mind and have different opinions on many topics and be respectful. We should not label each other as haters, and should respect each other as fellow fans. Please comment below on your thoughts on the recent episode. Just remember to be respectful not bash on others." True text

I’m sure they are most well known in the asian anime fandom, but probably not in the western fandom. Baozi and Hana are cosplayers, but most importantly, they are both Chinese, live in China, and are openly gay and China is a very homophobic country. Recently, after episode 10, Hana posted this post on his instagram “看完新的一话YOI…心里有超多话想说，与其说是被他们的爱所感动，不如说是被鼓励，在这样一个动画里也看到了许多我们的影子…就像微博上说的一段，两个人互相吸引，喜欢，相互扶持，携手并进，最后给对方承诺。虽然明白很多人一直在惊讶于动画这么明明白白的刻画同性爱，也有很多人还是不愿相信这一对的感情是爱，但在我眼中真的很感谢创作者给了我们这样一个美好的世界 “ I’m not proficient enough in chinese to translate everything, but here is the important paragraph:   “After watching the newest episode of YOI, I have a lot to say, but instead of saying I’m touched/moved by their love, I’d rather say I’m encouraged by their love. In this anime I see our shadows (meaning he sees a lot of similarities between Victuri and themselves), both are attracted to each other, fell in love, helped each other, promised each other.  Even though many people are still shocked that there is definitely same-sex romance present in the anime, there are also a lot of people who still deny they are in love, but in my eyes, I will forever be grateful to the authors for giving us such a beautiful world.”  I love how Kubo-sensei also tweeted something which supports the idea above. She says ”  No matter what real people think about this anime, within its world no one is ever going to be discriminated against because of what they like. And that is something I will always protect.” And all I want to say is, Kubo-sensei, you have done your job well. And this is also why I love yuri on ice, it’s not just a favourite anime for me anymore, but it will forever hold a special place in my heart.  " False text

We deny ourselves happy memories, saying “If it doesn’t work now, our love then wasn’t real.” We pass on relationships we know would be short, because if it doesn’t last forever, what’s the point in joy in the moment?
