I mean think about it: at first you might think the van was a work car from the black factory, but as he continued to have it months after that + the personalized number plate its safe to assume he bought it. The dude bought a huge expensive vehicle with heaps of seats. This is the same man who has no family or friends. So why? Obviously the only reason Iyami went out and got that particular car was because he knew all of the sextuplets could fit in it. It’s even better when you realise he passively aggressively drives them around for the rest of the remaining episodes. So basically Iyami is just a bitter old man willingly chauffeuring the sextuplets around in his soccer mom van that he bought and its great.  omg these are the best tags, so true i like to think bc he’s so nostalgic for when he was lead character he still grips onto anything that reminds him of that time. Like he lives in a crowded city now, he has the option to never see the sextuplets or Chibita or any of those characters ever again if he wants to. But he keeps finding excuses to bump into them and spend time with them and its adorable   Haha oh man I’m glad you like my tags I love rambling on them And that’s pretty accurate too, Iyami is the character that holds on the most to the past IMO, both as a self-aware cartoon character and as a person. He probably can’t imagine a life away from his neighborhood and these awful kids, though if someone were to ask him if he’s always running into them on purpose, he’d get all defensive and sputter some super specific denial like “Who said that deep down I consider them friends?! I don’t! I never did and never will! Wait, what was the question again?” " False text

They come to him with their problems and he usually succeeds in making them feel better by telling them how much more unfortunate he is. - Apparently, combusting (like in the ep with the christmas couple) is just a thing that happens to him. He’s not immune to it, either, he says it hurts him immensely. - Ichimatsu claims in all seriousness that he’s never once in his life won while gambling. - He’s genuinely nice to Kara in the track, even if he has to tsun it up a little at the end to maintain the illusion. - He talks to himself. Not like how characters narrate things aloud because it’s a drama CD, but I mean legitimately has a back-and-forth with himself. He tells himself to fuck off, essentially.  Okay okay I’ve seen the transcript for this myself, so for those who are curious about the exact details of what happened, here they are: -Oso’s hurt after finding out that Totty didn’t invite him to his last mixer, and whines to Ichi about it. Ichi, in return, tells him that he was just at the convenience store and the automatic doors wouldn’t open for him even though they opened for everyone else that passed by. Oso, thinking that Ichi had it worse, tells him he feels better now and thanks him. -Choro, who was just at another Nyaa-chan concert, is upset and whines to Ichi about how Nyaa-chan didn’t recognize him from before when he went up to greet her. Ichi responds by saying that earlier that day, Matsuyo momentarily forgot his name. Choro decides that Ichi was the one who had it worse and says he feels better now. -Jyushi’s upset because he ate a whole bunch of candies, gum, and ice cream, and “didn’t win at all,” calling what he just endured “hell.” Ichi responds by saying that he’s only drawn blank white paper for fortune slips. You know the drill by now, Jyushi decides his problems aren’t really that big and tells Ichi that he feels better. -By the time we get to Totty, Ichi’s fully embraced his status as the family counselor and rolls with the “next patient can come on in” schtick (there’s even like a doctor curtain). Totty is upset that an unknown culprit told the girls at his mixer that he was a NEET. He claims that he could just die from the embarrassment, and Ichi responds by alluding to his encounter with the Christmas Couple and how he ended up combusting into flames. Realizing that Ichi could’ve literally died and his own embarrassment can’t measure up to that, Totty thanks him and leaves. -Then there’s Kara, who just comes running in and yelling about how he’s cursed and hasn’t won anything (horse racing, pachinko, mahjong) at all this past month. Ichi comforts him by telling him that he hasn’t won anything since the day he was born. Kara thanks him and leaves, with Ichi calling out to him, “Come again whenever you want, stupid!” (lol) -And last but not least, Ichi himself shows up to Ichi’s counseling room, asking for advice on some things. Ichi, in return, tells his other self to fuck off.  Since i saw this added to this post, i wanted to say it’s not the others who decide first that everything Ichimatsu has lived is worse but Ichimatsu.  To give you an example:  CHOROMATSU: *tells Ichimatsu Nyaa didn’t recognize him at all when he greeted her* It’s a nightmare! ICHIMATSU: It’s not a nightmare at all… CHOROMATSU: Eh? ICHIMATSU: *explains him what he lived is worse by letting him know about Matsuyo who didn’t remember his name when she called him for something earlier* CHOROMATSU: EH?! Mom… forgot your name?!ICHIMATSU: Yes. CHOROMATSU: It’s really… a nightmare.ICHIMATSU: Exactly. That’s what a true nightmare is.CHOROMATSU: *says he feels better & thanks Ichimatsu*   It’s being picky, i know, but it’s to point out Ichimatsu knows his bad life experiences are worst and that he’ll make his brothers feel better with his misery. 😉 " False text
