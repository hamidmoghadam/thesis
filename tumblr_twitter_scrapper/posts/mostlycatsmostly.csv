A job opening at a Dublin veterinary clinic is getting a ton of attention because, well, it basically sounds like a dream job for cat enthusiasts.  “Cat Cuddles Needed!” reads the job posting at Just Cats Veterinary Clinic & Cattery, a veterinary clinic devoted to — you guessed it — cats. The post asks potential applicants some crucial questions to see if they’re the right fit: Are you a crazy cat person and loves cats? Does cattitude come naturally to you? Have you counted kittens before you go asleepDo you feed the stray cats in your locality? Does petting cats make you feel warm and fuzzy? The site explains that a cat cuddler’s responsibility is to help calm felines that may be anxious about their time at the vet. That’s why qualifications include “gentle hands capable of petting and stroking cats for long periods of time,” a soft-spoken demeanor and “an ability to understand different types of purring.” (For those confused about what this last one means — purring is typically associated with being content, but cats also sometimes purr when they are stressed or afraid.) With all the attention the job is getting (not to mention how amazing it sounds), it’s sure to be ultra-competitive. It’s also not clear from the post whether the clinic is accepting international applicants. But if you’re still dying to cuddle cats and kittens, you’re in luck.  Animal shelters are often in need of volunteers to socialize and play with the animals in their care. The need is especially strong during kitten season — the warmer months of the year when lots of kittens are born and many animal shelters become overwhelmed with homeless young felines. Rescue groups also often need people to foster kittens that were separated from their mothers too early, meaning you can even cuddle kittens in the comfort of your own home.  Sure, you might not be getting paid, but professional cat cuddlers have to start somewhere. " True link

Unfortunately, that’s not something he can afford- he’s managed to talk to the vet and gotten a payment plan set up, but they definitely need the first half of the money before anything can happen. If you’ve got some spare change rattling around, please donate; Alexander and Kiko the kitten need it desperately! (Submitted by @pearlance )" True link

I love watching the cats and making up names for them. I love them all. Especially Popcorn, who I adore most. Just if you have the chance add them on Facebook, or watch their stream before you go to bed. It’s very relaxing.  Please share so that they can get the attention they deserve.  If you cannot I understand. Thank you for your time.  @mostlycatsmostly " False link

I happened to run into them just after it happened, and they said they couldn’t do anything with him, so I offered to take him in. He’s very sick. It looks like he got attacked by another animal, probably a cat (and I don’t mean gotten into a fight, all of his wounds are on his hind end like he was running away and got grabbed from behind), has blood in his urine which is most likely a severe urinary tract infection, limps on his back left leg, and was very dirty. This little guy isn’t feral, and even with how bad he must feel and how much pain he must be in he still wants attention and scratches, and purrs the whole time. I want to give him a second chance at a life and a home, since I’m pretty sure he was someone’s cat at one time, and just escaped. I have contacted multiple rescues and researched all the ones in my area, and either they haven’t answered me, or they say they can’t or aren’t legally allowed to take him. The only real place he could go is the pound, and they would just put him to sleep due to his medical issues. He doesn’t have a collar, and even if I manage to find an owner, he doesn’t have the weeks that may take to find them with the illnesses he has. I’m not asking for funds to cover the leg as of right now, since that won’t kill him, but infection that spreads from his bladder, his wounds, or a parasite might. I’m asking for enough to cover a blood and urine test, and any dewormer and antibotics that come with it. I know my facebook doesn’t have a lot on it; I deleted my other one a long time ago and just use that one to communicate with my dog’s daycare, and if any of you have any concerns or questions about my validity I will be happy to answer them! Thank you so much for your time and any donations you can give! Even one dollar would be so helpful! And always reblog please! Signal Boost for an injured kitty." False link
