It’s a pretty “feminine”, yet rather plain, room. - Riju’s room has quite a lot of stuffed animals, similar to those you’d find in crane game machines. At the back at the room, you can find a statue related to her ancestors. - Purah’s room has a blackboard covered in writing. It shows she’s a genius that simply cannot see what’s around her when she’s deep in concentration. - the various diaries scattered around the game contain useful information, and even some tips - you can even get to see signs of actual human relationships between characters - Cado and Rola from Kakariko Village used to be together, but they’re now separated - if you take a look at their room, you will find something similar - Cado simply loves Cuccos, which is why there’s plenty of pictures of them on the walls - Cado also happens to be quite skilled with a bow, which is why he displays his favorite bows on the wall - there’s Higanbana (known as red spider lily in English) in both houses, and they are found nowhere else in the game - Higanbana refers to Hanakotoba, which represents “Never to meet again / Lost memory / Abandonment” - the two characters are pretty clumsy, which makes Manabu Takehara wonder if the two will ever get back together" False text

Partly because Nintendo was still working on the back end. But we worked very closely with them in terms of what we needed. They gave us a kind of roadmap so we understood when certain things would be put in place.We had a grasp of what the technology was, but the big unknown was how quickly we could actually port the game. Turns out we could do that very quickly. It has come with its challenges, but we’re a very experienced development company and we’ve got a hell of a lot of talent internally. We put our best guys on it to make sure we had it converted very quickly.We got the code across onto Switch - or at least certain parts of it - in a matter of hours, so we started becoming more confident that we could achieve what we wanted and within the timescales we were looking at. Within seven days, we had it fully playable.Up until the day that we flew out to GDC, we were still working on the Switch version to optimise the code. Nintendo are really happy with it, and we’re extremely happy with it. But without the support of Nintendo, Unreal and Nvidia, our job would have been a lot more difficult. They were key - particularly Nintendo, who were keen to have it as a launch title - and we’re extremely happy we can launch all versions on the same day.”  Ease of development is another major strength for the Switch."

I played a tonne of MK8 on Wii U before making the transition to MK8 Deluxe on switch. While these are by and large the same game, I swear they’ve made some changes to the mechanics, even besides the removal of fire hopping. I’ve been seeing a lot of questions online about how drift braking works. As I now feel fairly competent with this skill I figured I’d make a post sharing what I know for those who are finding it difficult to adjust coming from the Wii U version (I know I did) as well as those who skipped out on the original release. I’ll also give some tips on the builds I like.II) Drift Braking1) Initiate a drift by steering into a turn while holding the R button as usual. Keep in mind that starting drifts well in advance of turns is imperative to doing well in 200cc.2) If you find yourself coming in too sharp, tap or hold the joystick in the opposite direction of the turn (while continuing to hold y and r) to correct.3) If you’re taking a turn too wide, tap or hold the brake while continuing to drift (tap or hold b while continuing to hold y, r, and the joystick in the direction of the turn). I accomplish this by sliding my thumb to the b button while continuing to hold down y. This should both reduce your speed and increase the sharpness of the turn allowing you to maintain a good line.III) Jump TricksIt’s not always a good idea to trick off of a jump in 200cc. Whenever a jump is proceeded by a sharp turn it’s probs best not to trick so you don’t take the corner too wide and either hit a wall or lose the optimal line.IV) Examples of Difficult Turns in 200ccThese are areas where I really feel I’ve noticed a difference in handling between MK8 Deluxe and the Wii U original. I find that I even have to brake drift in 150cc for some of these (brake drifting didn’t work in the Wii U’s 150cc but it does on switch). I’ll break my strats down for each individually:1) Toad’s HarbourComing out of the market area, there’s an overpass on the right that takes you up to a boost jump into a shortcut. It’s incredibly hard to Land from this jump and not go flying into a wall. Initiate a rightward drift before going off the jump and hold brake as you go into the boost. Do not trick off of this jump. When you land you should already be facing the appropriate direction to exit the shortcut. Release the brake and the drift and you should make it out with your drift boost.2) Wario’s StadiumEarly on in the track you come to a large ramp with a boost at the end. You land in a hard left turn before a series of small boost jumps in the mud. Initiate a left drift partway up the large ramp. Hold the brake as you go into the boost. Once again, do not trick. When you land you should be facing the appropriate direction to exit the turn. Release the brake and your drift for a drift boost. Do not trick off of the series of small boost jumps that come next as you’ll go flying into a wall when you hit the hard left turn afterward. Hold the inputs for a hard left drift while also holding brake as you land. Release when you have the right angle to exit the turn.3) Rainbow Road (Wii U)The right and left turns in quick succession just before the first jump may be the hardest segment in 200cc. Take the right turn nice and wide while tapping the brake liberally to moderate your speed. Release your drift when you have the ultra boost. This is where it gets pretty difficult. Immediately initiate a left drift and hold the brake for the entire duration of the turn. I find that tapping the joystick right just after starting the drift helps get into position for the best line. Release the boost when you’re at the correct angle to take the jump.There are a number of other s-shaped curves on tracks like Neo Bowser City and the Dragon Raceway (I forget the actual name) which can be navigated using this same strat.V) Dodging Blue ShellsThere are a number of strats one can use to dodge or reduce speed loss from blue shells. These are the same as the Wii U version:1) super hornThis one is obvious.2) use a mushroomAs the blue shell reaches you it will circle a few times before diving down and exploding. Use your mushroom just as the shell begins to dive and you’ll escape the blast radius without being affected. I find the timing on this to be a bit more difficult online with lag.3) Fall off the trackIf a blue shell reaches you on a portion of the track in which you can fall off, do so. You have to time it so that lakitu picks you up while the shell explodes. This will lose you less time than if you just take the blue shell. Be very careful online. Lag can throw off the timing and cause you to take the blue shell on top of lakitu dropping you off.VI) Best Builds for 200ccI generally find that balanced builds work best here. I tend to keep most stats between 3 and 4. I started practicing with Mario using the standard kart, tires, and super glider and adjusted from there. As I got better I increased my top speed at the expense of other stats, tho handling, acceleration, and - to a lesser degree - traction are all nearly as important.I’ve broken all the staff 200cc ghosts with builds like:1) inkling boy/splat buggy/hylian tires/hylian kite2) Link/standard cart/standard tires/hylian kite3) Morton/koopa clown/rollers/bowser kiteI’ve been doing some research lately and I think I’ve found one of the best all around builds that will help you to do really well on any track:4) Gold/metal mario or pink gold peach/w 25/standard tires/super gliderDon’t remember the exact stats off the top of my head but it has a speed of 4.00 with everything else around 3 or 4 and a total of 19. Haven’t been able to come up with anything else having such a high total. Most end up around 17 or 18.That’s all I’ve got. Please comment if you have anything to add or questions about other difficult turns in the game. via /r/NintendoSwitch" True link

I found it VERY useful when transporting the blue flame to Robbie.2: Cook Hearty Radishes alone (with out anything else, one at a time). Each one you cook will give you full recovery plus 4-5 extra hearts. Cooking 2 (at a time) will only give you 4-5 EXTRA extra hearts, but then it wastes 1 full recovery.3: In the Yiga Clan Hideout, right after the first wooden gate, you will see a ladder right ahead of you. Climb up it, and head to the end of the hallway. There will be 20-ish Mighty Bananas there, which can be cooked 5 at a time to get rank 3 attack bonus for a while, as well as at least 5 heart recoveries.4: Take pictures of as many different object and creatures as you can. This will allow you to track those objects and creatures later in the game.5: Explore the huge world. Breath of the Wild has an ENORMOUS overworld (12 times bigger than Twilight Princess’s overworld), so explore around as much as you can! For instance, when I was supposed to be going to Kakariko Village, I instead explored all the way out to Hateno Village, and completed 12 more shrines along the way, so when Impa told me to go there, I could just warp right on over! Also, while exploring, I found TONS of ore that I sold which allowed me to get the Sheikah Armor.6: When upgrading hearts and stamina, keep it even. I went from upgrading hearts once to stamina once, and back and forth. I started paying more attention to hearts once i had upgraded each about 5 times (so that i could pull out the master sword, which, if you didn’t know, requires AT LEAST 13 hearts (extra yellow hearts wont count when pulling up the master sword)).7: DURIANS. Probably one of the best cooking ingredients in BotW. Cooking 5 at once will give you 20-21 EXTRA hearts PLUS a full recovery, which is useful in a pinch. Luckily, I’ve found an easy way to farm durians. Fast travel over to Faron Tower. There will be a plateau near the tower. Paraglide to it, and you’ll find a bunch of trees holding durians. From there, just start filling up your inventory by cooking 5 at a time.Hope this helped! :) via /r/Breath_of_the_Wild" True link

Anything else you think a beginner of this game should know??(afterbirth+ is my first experience with Isaac)Thank you so much in advance for the advice!! :) via /r/bindingofisaac" True link
