(And Obi-Wan let him, to clear the air between them in that pragmatic way the two of them likely deal with their feelings.) “Told you he’d do that, too.”  YES GOOD. THIS IS MY FAVE VERSION OF EVENTS but also: wasn’t this just after zygerria? would a clearly fucked up obi who limped into the council room not be Super Fucked Up on the way there, and wouldn’t that make the clones a tiny bit more likely to believe he got caught off guard by something that normally wouldn’t even have a chance?   BUT GOOD JOB CODY YOU’RE DOING GREAT maybe be extra snarky when u hand him back his lightsaber the next few times  (Cody Angst, your tags say?) Obi-Wan sat with his head in his hands, the blond fuzz that had started to grow back soft between his fingers, unwilling to look up at the man that had just walked into his quarters and interrupted another long stretch of meditation devolving into regret. “You look like kaj, sir,” came the crisp, professional tone of his commander, oddly no less so for the crude Mandalorian slang thrown in. No greeting, no warmth. Obi-Wan had been getting used to everyone being angry with him. Or he thought he had been. Ahsoka, Anakin… But Cody, he had thought, would have understood the most out of all of them that this thing was not something he had wanted to do to any of them. Cody, he had thought, would forgive him the fastest. And yet when he dared to look up, nervously stroking a beard that hadn’t grown back yet, Cody’s eyes were full of anger, bright and hot as he stared down at him, and his fists hung curled and trembling at his side. I thought you were dead, Cody’s furious glare said, more eloquent than any words could have been. I trusted you. Obi-Wan let his head sink back into his hands, unable to meet his gaze any longer. But I suppose your trust in me is the only thing that is dead now, isn’t it?   #OH NO THIS IS. TOO MUCH #no!!#im saying no but ty sith lord darth angstius i knew i could count on u#this is AWFUL i am Always here for obi and cody things #OUCH tho that last line#TOO MUCH #star wars #obi wan #cody (via @resistancepilots) So I have been informed by @generallkenobi and these tags I have gone TOO far in the direction of angst. Let’s see if I can pull out of this tailspin before the Codywan ship augurs into a field, huh? ——– “Get up,” Cody finally says, holding onto his cool, detached tone by the barest of threads. The fury is still there, but the sight of his general alive and whole is too much for it to remain the pure, blinding emotion it began as and relief tightens his heart. “Get up and come with me.” “Where are we going?” Cody thinks about it, watching him for a long time, the silence stretching out between them as his feelings war with each other in a vicious snarl. Obi-Wan has the distinct sense a decision is being made, a serious one, and wisely says nothing as he waits for the verdict. “A ceremony,” Cody finally says, almost nodding to himself. “A ceremony?” Obi-Wan stands, the line of his shoulders stiff with wariness and exhaustion. “Is this some kind of a joke?” “No, sir. Something,” he pauses, standing a little taller as his voice lowers, “Something we brothers do for men who die in the field and come back.” Obi-Wan listens, holding his breath in stunned bewilderment. Cody hates him, he thinks, clearly hates him and yet he’s telling him this? The clones are famous, some say infamous, for the secret, insular culture they’ve created for themselves beyond the battlefield, a complicated system of language and ritual and spiritualism outsiders are never allowed to learn about. Obi-Wan has served with them for years and still doesn’t understand half of the hand-signs and good luck charms and curses he encounters with his men. “Are you sure?” “Yes. It… the man who died on the field has gone on. The man who comes back is stronger. But he must be tested.” Obi-Wan nods in grim respect and acceptance. He is expecting combat, perhaps hand-to-hand, with some of the men in his battalion. He is completely unprepared for the three days of hard drinking and partying that follow, every single clone on the ship sharing a drink with him and celebrating his return from the dead in a raucous, living wake that Cody is careful to shield from Coruscant by arranging for a short trip to a safe, remote system followed by a minor engine malfunction that will take the onboard techs a week to fix between their own toasts to the general. Cody has vouched for Obi-Wan, the whispers say, and so the brothers understand. The man that died was the Jedi, the man who belonged to and had to obey the distant, bloodless Council. He was weak and deserved their anger. The man laughing his way through his eighth drink of the morning as he tries to tell a particularly funny story about the clone across from him to a crowd of brothers is theirs. He has died and risen. He is one of them now.  " False text

What Jedi are good at is perceiving clearly and  accurately, and making the best choices based on that perception.  Anything that distorts that perception or artificially narrows that  field of choices is attachment. Here’s a dead bantha, and I’m going to flog it another time: Attachment does not (only) mean desire for various kinds of closeness with other people. Attachment is any kind of obsessive thinking, and the behavior that proceeds from it. One of the biggest obstacles in that category, in the Buddhist philosophical material that Star Wars is sourced from, isn’t romantic feelings. It’s attachment to the outcome of your actions. You may perform a task, and the result may be what you intended, or given the vast, multifarious, tightly-interconnected nature of the whole of everything, maybe it won’t. You are not in control of what happens as a result of that thing you did; you couldn’t possibly be. Acting as if you could would be at odds with observable reality, literally insane. Problem is, you do it anyway. In a state of nature, your mind grinds away incessantly in the background trying to resolve that uncertainty and chaos and protect from pain. Worry. Blame. Bargaining. Ignoring. Self-talk varying from affirming and positive to downright vicious. All of those? Are behaviors that fall under the heading of attachment. They take up a lot of your perceptive and decision-making capacity; you make yourself tired doing them, you miss out on more relevant, more pressing things because you’re doing them. And you’re doing them anyway because sitting with your fundamental limitedness is hard. When Luke says “Alright, I’ll give it a try,” he’s doing an ego-defensive thing. He’s preemptively imagining and addressing future possible pain, preparing himself and/or Yoda for the likelihood that he won’t be able to pull his fighter free of the swamp. Yoda doesn’t give a damn about Luke’s ego. He’s telling him that little innocuous-seeming reflexes of mind like that are blinding him and sapping his strength. Why would you editorialize about something you haven’t done yet as if you could know how things are going to unfold or what to do about them? Do or do not." False text

(there are a lot of jokes about wolves and chew toys in the GAR)  I’m a bad person and my brain immediately went NSFW places after the first sentence but seriously that definitely sounds like a nervous coping mechanism he’d have chewing gum in his helmet to avoid mouthing off to superiors that are not Plo Plo gauges how stressed out he is by how quickly he destroys datapad styluses. Hardcase got him a squeaky toy as a joke and wolffe promptly beat him over the head with it He’ll never admit it but he actually sleeps with it and keeps it stuffed in his armor (via gallusrostromegalus) Your tags are absolutely perfect and I need them on my blog. (but now I’m going to laugh about that.  “Uh, Commander?  Why is your armor squeaking?” “…no reason.”)  Wolffe would straight-up tell people below him in rank that he has a squeaky toy.  The man is officially out of fuck to give, and that toy makes him happy, dammit.  People above him would get gaslighted.  “What squeaking?  Boil, do you hear squeaking?” “No sir.”  “Must be the air ducts.” It’s a stuffed bunny, btw.  and purple.   Plo is sometmes frightened by the things Wolffe chews on.  “Are…  is that a rib-bone” “Yessir.” “Where did you find that?”  “It was on this carcass in the road-”  “WOLFFE! NO!”  “But I’m hungry!” I also headcanon that Wolffe is hungry ALL THE TIME and eats enough for three people.  And he’s not picky.  or shy about hunting.  Ornamental fish have gone missing from royal ponds if he has to do security detail and doesn’t get fed first. On the NSFW side of things, like most clones, Wolffe is very curious about other species and speculates a lot in the privacy of his helmet.  Or rather, the thinks the sort of thoughts that  would set a more conservative Jedi’s head on fire out of sheer luridness, and hasn’t figured out that Plo can passively pick up on thoughts if you’re standing near him and thinking about it hard enough. So the poor master is sitting there, trying to pay attention at some diplomatic summit and he keeps being assaulted with this continual stream of smut from his commander, rather a lot of it focus on just what would his cock taste like…  The rabbit’s name is probably Hardcase.  It starts out as payback, because you are automatically 72% less badass when people discover there’s a stuffed purple squeaky bunny named after you.  Then it becomes kind of a tribute after he dies - I get the feeling clones generally don’t have much in the way of possessions, aside from armor and guns and whatnot (and even those are frequently replaced due to wear and tear), so even if it was a joke, that toy might be the only real personal gift Wolffe’s ever gotten.  He is really attached to it. Its ears are pretty much gone, though, since Wolffe chewed them to shreds within a week.  Even things he likes, he chews into oblivion.  He can’t entirely help it.  Someone reblogged the original post and compared it to thumb-sucking. Wolffe stealing the ornamental fish when he’s hungry is FUCKING HILARIOUS and also reminds me of a conversation from Mass Effect 2 where Shepard can talk to a krogan who thinks there are fish in the Citadel ponds and wants to eat one.  But anyway, poor Plo is probably just like… the Wolfpack is a staunchly disciplined, terrifyingly effective subsection of the Republic military force, and yet here he is waiting for its Commander to cause a diplomatic incident by A. eating someone’s prized aquatic pets, B. absent-mindedly gnawing on some priceless artifact, or C. losing that damn rabbit toy of his and threatening somebody important with death and dismemberment if it isn’t found right this instant.  And the rest of the pack just enables this behavior because Wolffe is a damn good leader in spite of his quirks. …okay, I personally headcanon clones as asexual, but the idea of Wolffe’s brain being a 24/7 xenophiliac porn channel is kind of amazing. (Now I’m thinking about Kel Dor anatomy.  Great.)  And honestly I’ve always thought that if any clone was going to fall in love with their general, it’d be Wolffe going head over heels for Plo Koon.  The GAR rumor mill ships clones and Jedi all the time just for shits and giggles, nobody takes it seriously, but when Wolffe and General Plo are the topic du jour Wolffe gets SUPER AWKWARD, which just convinces everyone it’s true despite his loud and frequent denials.  Even Boost and Sinker, who’ve known him longest, begin to wonder.  And finally they put their lives on the line and bring it up, so you know how everyone thinks you’re in love with General Plo, sort of gently suggest that if he is, it’s not really a big deal… Wolffe threatens to desert if the two of them start in on him.  They drop the subject, but yeah, now they’re certain. Also, ever since Ventress ripped out his eye and laid half his face open, he really, really does not like people getting too close to his cybernetic eye.  You know … I remember this post, and I saw the ghost of it on my dash, and I wondered if anyone ever broke this down on why parts of it are hugely racist. But, I don’t think that was the case.Yes, even the original post, as simple as it is, treads really uncomfortable territory of “yikes.”Sooo. I have time now, I’m gonna do this before I forget.I’m sorry in advance for the tone. I am trying, really trying, to be nice about this. But the popularity of even the original post on its own, without critical thought to its implications, is grating. It needs to be addressed.So … Again. I’m sorry in advance. Emphasis in quotes are mine.@sauntering-down Commander Wolffe has the worst oral fixation known to man.  if it fits in his mouth, he will chew on it.  practically everything he owns has teeth marks.(there are a lot of jokes about wolves and chew toys in the GAR)@gallusrostromegalus   Plo is sometmes frightened by the things Wolffe chews on.  “Are…  is that a rib-bone” “Yessir.” “Where did you find that?”  “It was on this carcass in the road-”  “WOLFFE!

Is reducing Wolffe to something akin to an animal. Something I’ve gone into time and time again, but will again address here.Wolffe is a nonwhite man, in a galaxy in which his humanity is not a given, in which he is viewed as a possession instead of a person … and jokes like “chew toys” and playing up the “feral” and “animalistic” aspects he may or may not exhibit is not cute or quirky — it feeds into a very real, very damaging history of our society based in racism. Systemic racism. People, specifically non-white people, especially men of color, often have animalistic tendencies and characteristics projected onto them in order to victimize them — to justify violence, to justify racism, to dehumanize them.It’s not quirky. It’s not funny. It’s not light and silly. What this thread does is tread those lines uncomfortably close and then just jumps the line completely further down. And the headcanon alone isn’t bad. Like … There’s some really great things in here! Really great things! Chewing as a stim or nervous tic, Wolffe being in love with General Plo Koon, having a (one off) security toy named after Hardcase, chewing through styluses faster than he can replace them, not wanting anyone too close to his cybernetic eye — these are all really great, sweet, interesting headcanons!So why must you then play up the idea that Wolffe is somehow anything less than human? As if, as a person, he is incapable of understanding simple rules like don’t eat someone’s pet fish? Because the laughs of him being more like an Actual Animal That Doesn’t Get Human Things is somehow funnier than him not being dehumanized?  Chew toys are a deliberate, clear reference to the types of toys you give to pets and not people. Wolffe eating royal fish out of a pond because he doesn’t “understand” he shouldn’t, as if a simple brief before the mission wouldn’t cover that … cannot be interpreted in any other way than treating this as one pet eating another pet, or one pet eating another possession, because they don’t understand the human’s rules.And I fail to see how it’s cute. I fail to see how it’s funny. This is part of a consistent trend in fandom to dehumanize Wolffe and the clones of wolfpack, to reduce him to an animal for the luls, bc he happens … to be named Wolffe. Because wolves are his/their thing. Often in complete disregard of the racism you’re perpetuating.Like I get it. It’s easy to miss. Totally understandable. You can’t miss it now when I’m literally telling you it’s racist.  And aside from all the above, chewing on things and “not knowing not to put this thing/animal in his mouth” tone reeks of infantilization. Is he a pet? Is he a child? There’s a lot of interesting directions to go with the chewing thing, but to immediately jettison into an extreme irregardless of how it mirrors reality and society is not … not good.Like. Yeah, it’s fiction, but fiction in media does affect reality. Echoes reality. It also makes non-white people unsafe in fandom spaces, because lol the dehumanizing jokes are more important than recognizing that real people are the target of jokes like these in real life — and now they get to see it when they come online.Like, I didn’t even touch the nsfw stuff … so I’m moving on to that now.Okay. Like. Lmao. I, personally, think it’s (genuinely) funny the scenario of entertaining some really NSFW in the privacy of one’s helmet/armor and not knowing that the Jedi can pick up the specifics. That’s pretty funny — and it’s been brought up in expanded universe things in all kinds of ways (as both a distraction and a shield from probing among other things). As an occasional thing. On occasion.Not a constant stream, as if someone is incapable of shutting that off. In a thread of extremes, we also needed to go the nsfw extreme.Really.  and he keeps being assaulted with this continual stream of smut from his commander, rather a lot of it focus on just what would his cock taste like…    but the idea of Wolffe’s brain being a 24/7 xenophiliac porn channel is kind of amazing.  Hypersexualizing nonwhite men is a great look. Because that isn’t something already tied into the complications of dehumanizing nonwhite men by imposing animalistic tendencies on them …….. wait. Yes it is. And like, this is SO EASY to predict. The second nonwhite men are given animalistic qualities, clearly compared to animals, you can guarantee that they will be hypersexualized to an extreme, fetishistic degree. There’s a huge leap between idly fantasizing about a person’s crush, and 24/7 porn all day every day. Like … why was this even necessary? Why was that necessary? also, mmmm, this post is ableist?like. to headcanon a character as stimming by chewing then elaborating on that with, as izzyovercoffee said, some choice dehumanization….. Yikes?the train of thought here, chews things -> chews things: framed in a negative light edition -> has a comfort object (again this concept is framed in a mocking/negative way) -> doesnt understand social mores (still the mocking tone), this is racist as hell but also as an autistic person its giving me hivesagain, wolffe is literally narratively Not A Person With Rights so. consider your impulse to 1) ascribe him autistic traits 2) in a ‘lol hes so weird’ way 3) while also dehumanising him to the tune of infantalization. consider it really hard& please consider the tone of your headcanon posts bc there is a fine line btwn 'this character has a quirk & its endearing & also funny’ & 'this character is Weird™ lets all point & laugh at the weirdo’.its not hard to make non-harmful content yall! please!!"

If Marshal Commander Cody had been de-chipped when Order 71 came in, he wouldn’t have known what the fark Order 71 even was.  But because his chip was neutralized rather than removed, not only is Cody no longer compelled to obey Order 71, but he also knows precisely what Order 71 is… and thus precisely what he needs to do to in order to avert it. Cody is quick and he’s smart and he’s tough, but most of all he’s adaptable. It’s not as though he attained his current rank and position by pure chance.

None of them still have audio, however, and despite their specialists’ best efforts, they haven’t been able to glean any useful information from them. This is because Palpatine normally obscures himself very well on holo transmissions, in addition to ensuring that the channel is highly encrypted and the signal untraceable. But he got sloppy this time, assuming that as a chipped clone, Cody was already on his side, so what difference would it make anyway?? Upon being presented with this new data, Obi-Wan Kenobi is gobsmacked. The Chancellor is the Sith master they’ve been searching for all these years? It… makes a disturbing amount of sense when he stops to think about it. Palpatine has always been there in the background, always conveniently around to benefit from bad situations.

Okay, but like, imagine that Anakin feels bad about the clone cadets never getting to finish their tour on the Endurance (and all right, maybe it’s also a great excuse to goof around and show off all his cool Jedi moves to an appreciative audience with no Obi-Wan in the background rolling his eyes), so he invites the cadets to visit the Resolute instead. The clone cadets step off the shuttle on the Resolute, shuffling nervously down the gangway, and the entire Torrent Company, assembled for pre-battle inspection in the main hangar bay, do a double take at the sight of Hotshot. One hundred plus helmets execute a perfectly synchronous head-turn and stare at mini-Rex. And then the whispers start. And don’t stop. Hotshot has no idea what’s going on.

Steven S. DeKnight is directing the film, which will begin production in the fourth quarter of this year, based on the world created by Guillermo del Toro and Travis Beacham. Boyega will play the son of the character played by Idris Elba in the del Toro-directed original film. Universal will release the film worldwide, everywhere but China. The 2013 original grossed $411 million. Thomas Tull, Mary Parent, Jon Jashni, and del Toro will produce the action adventure film along with Boyega and Femi Oguns under their Upper Room Productions shingle. Cale Boyter is executive producer.  The picture is a beach head project for Legendary, under the leadership of Parent, who became Tull’s vice chairman of Worldwide Production after Jashni exited to start his own venture. The principals have confirmed to Deadline they found their man in Boyega. “It is undeniable that with all his talent and natural charm, John stands out amongst today’s generation of young leading men,” said Parent. Said del Toro: “I am very proud and happy to welcome John into a fantastic sandbox. The Pacific Rim universe will be reinforced with him as a leading man as it continues to be a multicultural, multi-layered world. ‘The World saving the world’ was our goal and I couldn’t think of a better man for the job.”      " False link
