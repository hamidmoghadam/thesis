We have spambots, viruses, ransomware, this endless legion of malevolent entities that are blindly probing us for weaknesses, seeking only to corrupt, to thieve, to destroy. Add onto that the corrupted ones themselves, humans who’ve abandoned morality and given up faces to hunt other people, jeering them, lashing out, seeing how easy it is to kill something you can’t touch or see or smell. They’ll corrupt anything they think could be a vessel for their message and they’ll jabber madly at any who question them. Their chittering haunts every corner of the internet. They are not unlike the spambots in some ways. Add on top of that the arcane magisters, who are forever working at the cracks between our world and the world we made. Some of them do it for fun, some of them do it for wealth, others do it for the power of nations unwise enough to trust them. There are mages who work to defend against this particular evil, but they are mad prophets, and their advice is almost never heeded, even by those who keep them as protection. All people know several spells to use the internet. Facebook asks you for the magic words to log in, so does your email, so does your twitter and on and on. The spells are words or a gesture with the hand, some use the colour of your eyes, or the shape of your finger. Our chief of security joked about requiring users to give a drop of blood before they could log in. Many do not understand the humour of mages. The cracks between the two are breaking. IP cameras filled our world with eyes and the magisters learned how to open almost all of them. We all carry magic slabs of glass that if you hold it up to your ear can sing to you with a loved one’s voice, but if you look at it with your eyes, can show you a corrupted human with bleeding orange skin scream the profane with a thousand voices.

Like its part of his nature, his character, a simple fact about who he is. The background. But describing Peter as “enslaved”–that’s something that has been done TO him.  It’s something he has suffered – it’s history, its process, it’s a situation, but its not his IDENTITY. He is more than that one thing, he exists in ways that that word cannot encompass. It’s conflict–external and internal. I know this isn’t much, but it’s something that once I noticed, I can’t un-notice. " True text

Such posttraumatic reactions make it difficult for survivors to connect with other people, since closeness often triggers the sense of danger. And yet the very thing we come to most dread after experiencing trauma — close contact with other people — is also the thing we most need in order to regain psychoemotional solidity and begin healing. Van der Kolk writes: Being able to feel safe with other people is probably the single most important aspect of mental health; safe connections are fundamental to meaningful and satisfying lives. This, he points out, is why we’ve evolved a refined mechanism for detecting danger — we’re incredibly attuned to even the subtlest emotional shifts in those around us and, even if we don’t always heed these intuitive readings, we can read another person’s friendliness or hostility on the basis of such imperceptible cues as brow tension, lip curvature, and body angles. But one of the most pernicious effects of trauma is that it disrupts this ability to accurately read others, rendering the trauma survivor either less able to detect danger or more likely to misperceive danger where there is none.

And I’m not just saying that because it’s made by my  friends at Campfire.The music is great and while I don’t mean to minimize the that, the music is almost the easiest part. But this writing and acting is amazing.  This kind of stuff is much harder than it looks; you have to find seams within the mythology of the main show that you can plumb to make compelling new characters and storylines, often without clear direction or access from the creators. And this campaign is pointing the way forward to something really important. Usually, these kinds of projects are done as pre-release awareness campaigns–marketing in advance of the release of a new film or show, or the season premiere of a returning show. And once the release is over, it’s time to move on to the next release, project, or title. It’s a dynamic I like to describe as, “Shut up audience; we’ll let you know when we want to market to you again.”But this campaign isn’t advertising a new season of The Man In The High Castle–season 2 ended a few months ago, and season 3 isn’t due for a while. So why do this now?Because in our new, on-demand world, pre-launch awareness is much less important that POST-LAUNCH awareness. No matter how many people tune in to your premiere, 99.9% of your potential audience won’t. Why not go after them? Just because they didn’t have the time or interest or awareness to tune inn when you first launched, doesn’t mean you can’t get them later. Especially when, if this campaign gets you interested in watching Man In The High Castle, you don’t have to wait–you can start immediately. So Resistance Radio isn’t just a great piece of storytelling in its own right; it’s an important bellwether for a changing perspective on how–and WHEN–to make these kinds of campaigns."
