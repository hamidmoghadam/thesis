Adding on to this by reminding everyone to leave feedback on fics. Seriously, y’all, fic writers put their heart, soul, blood, sweat, tears, and time into their writing. The least that you could do is let them know you enjoyed their works.   @snowbunnylester @botanistlester you guys literally wrote a fucking novel with The Summer. holy shit! yeeees Claire!! also @ineverhadmyinternetphase and I have written a novel with Steal My Heart when that finishes posting ;)" False text

IS soup  CEREAL IS SOUP this definition technically includes like….pudding and yogurt too, tho, i think  they said “much of the time.” there are also soups that don’t contain any of those things, e.g.: soups that are broth only soups that only contain noodles matzo ball soup   soup contains water. there ain’t no water in fuckn cereal  Milk is approximately 87% water If I may play devils advocate, cereal could also be considered a salad, with the dry cereal being the main meal, and the milk being a dressing or condiment.Before yall wanna talk about how salads only consist of vegetables, may I remind you of fruit salad, potato salad, pasta salad, bean salad, and the ugly cousin, jello salad.  yeah well my body is 60% water but u don’t see me chillin in a bowl with some carrots u feel  So, hot cereals (oatmeal, cream of wheat, etc) are forms of porridge, ie grains cooked in either a milk or water preparation. Lexically, porridge derives from pottage, which is unquestionably a soup. Cold cereal is trickier as it has no stage of being cooked in the liquid prior to being served, nor is the liquid cooked beforehand the way most soup broths are (pasteurization is a technically different process from my understanding; I’m also not getting into the hairy subject of the preparation of milk substitutes). I mean, it’s weird to think of cereal as a soup, but I’m not going to state for sure it isn’t.  Cereal is absolutely a soup.  A weird, lazy breakfast soup. Theoretically, you could argue that the time of day the food is consumed is the key.  I don’t think there are any breakfast soups that aren’t cereal or porridge.    Pho is traditionally a breakfast food, I think. And some people drink broth in the morning instead of tea or coffee.  How about the popularity of a bowl of soup being served before actual lunch? Makes zero sense to me. I call soups ‘uppity vegetable tea’ in fits of hungry pique.   I think that’s because liquid is very filling, so it’s good for tiding you over even when it’s not calorically dense.  I love these kinds of debates, they always lead to “if a man is a featherless biped, then a plucked chicken is a man” kinds of moments.Also, vsauce had an episode about this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9ak89FwYeI  I’m just reading through this and now I’m wondering if soup is even real or if it’s just been a figment of my imagination for my whole life.  soup is a social construct " False text
