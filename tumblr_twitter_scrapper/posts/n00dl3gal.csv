Hold his dismembered corpse in victory.  Plants don’t wage war  Ever heard of blackberries? Yes, plants do wage war  Mint and strawberries, too. They need to be quarantined or they will kill basically everything else.   I planted mint in the ground 2 years ago.  It’s currently fighting a bitter battle to the death against the raspberries attempting to invade from the east while trying to annex the patio.  Could go either way at this point TBH. Unless, of course, I take a shovel and the blowtorch out there and battle both back to within their original boundaries. And anyone wondering if a blowtorch is overkill for weeding back mint has never actually planted mint.   This post did not go where I expected it to.  Our garden plot at my childhood home slowly got overrun by wild blackberries after we stopped managing it while my sister and I were in nursing school. And by overrun I mean it was like a 4 foot tall thicket of wild blackberries. It hadn’t been touched by humans in at least 4 years. I started the ultimately futile task of trying to clear this plot with a machete and discovered to my amazement a patch of mint several feet across underneath the canopy of blackberry, still fighting the good fight all those years later.  Ultimately it took two jars of homemade napalm and some creative fire placement to clear that patch but I damn sure saved that patch of mint. It earned the right to be there.  Yall mother fuckers don’t even talk unless you’ve had to wage war on kudzu (it’s an ivy strain directly from Hell) that shit doesn’t just wage war with other plants, it wages war with all living things on planet earth. It’s some gnarly ass Blood for the Blood God, Chlorophyll for the Chlorophyll Throne demon weed.   Can second the comments of Kudzu. I forget where I read it but there’s this one tree that creates an extremely flammable substance that’s in both the bark and leaves. Dead trees become torches and crushed up leaves become dust-incendiary, all while the plant’s seeds are Giant Redwood levels of resilient to open flame. IE it has a goddamn scorched earth policy. It’s even more badass than plants that use toxins to starve other plants.  I’d like to third the comments on Kudzu. These are the battlefields: See those weird pillars? Those were trees. See that strange lump in the middle? That was a house. Everything green you see in this photo is kudzu.  Southern Gothic knows Lovecraft. We have fucking kudzu.  Trees definitely do war. My little sister and I both got tiny fir saplings for arbor day when we were sprouts. We planted them about 8′ apart. 25 years later, mine is a mighty forest giant, at least 50′ tall. Hers is a dead stump because mine stole all the water and sunlight. " False text

She gave me her STI results and said she was “clean”.  I hate that phrase so fucking hard.  I have family with various medical conditions and it doesn’t make them dirty. I’ve also had partners with STIs and you just have to be tested often, use protection and be a little creative. I am negative for STIs and I keep copies of my paperwork but I didn’t even tell her that cuz her response pissed me off so bad.  Now she stopped talking to me. I guess, I’m dirty too? The fuck?  The language you use matters. Your status is either negative or positive.  THANK YOU.  Related rant: I’ve had people flip out at me because I say STI status isn’t an instant dealbreaker as long as we can have an honest conversation about it and what precautions need to be taken. Like, not only is there the shame on people who have them (hence the “dirty” language), but if you don’t immediately reject and ostracize anyone you know who has or had ever had one, you’re a bad person too for not beating up on them? What the hell. I had a long-term relationship with somebody with HSV2 and when I went to get specialized testing after we broke up, the doctor grilled me on our safer sex practices and then told me that honestly he’d do the tests but he already knew I didn’t have it (and I didn’t). I’ve had several conversations with my sexual health providers related to this - that “just never get within breathing distance of somebody who isn’t ‘clean’” is fallacious and shameful. Meanwhile, I guarantee you that people are walking around with STIs that are undiagnosed or that they don’t tell people about because of the stigma. My most recent ex-boyfriend lied to me for like 2+ years about an unprotected one-night stand he had with some random person while heavily intoxicated because he was so invested in the image of himself as a person who would ~never do that~ until it turned out there was a very real possibility that he might have something incurable as a result. It turned out to be a false positive, but I got slapped with the emotional labor of coddling him through his shame because he was too self-centered to admit he’d done something to put me at risk. Hell, when I found out my first girlfriend ever was sleeping with other people and lying to me about it, her defense was that it was cool that she didn’t want to talk to me about it because “lesbians don’t get STDs anyway.” My ex, who gave me chlamydia years ago (which incidentally my doc referred to as “the strep throat of STIs”), was so insulted that I asked him to get tested before we slept together. His exact words were “the girls I’ve been with aren’t the type to get STDs.” I lit him up, because wtf does that even mean, and he got tested, and by that I mean he FAKED HIS TEST RESULTS because that was easier and less shameful somehow than going to the doctor.  It’s not about STIs. It’s about consent and respecting people enough to be honest with them.  I never even knew the word “clean” could be perceived like that. Damn.  I’m reblogging this because I recently had a partner send me fake STI results and it feels like complete bullshit. Because of this, I got checked out at Planned Parenthood last week. I’m negative for STIs yet I feel lied to. If people could/would openly talk about health concerns then this wouldn’t happen. Please have real conversations about safer sex with your partners.

So, I don’t know if you’ve heard but the Wonder Woman film comes out June 2nd… And if you didn’t know that, there’s a reason for it. Warner Brothers aren’t spending money on promoting the Wonder Woman film. No tv promotions, billboards, nothing. A film about a strong, powerful, amazing woman superhero directed by Patty Jenkins who happens to be the first woman to direct a superhero film with a female protagonist and one of only a handful (a literal handful… you can count on one hand) to direct a superhero film at all. They are setting it up to fail so they can say “I told you so” and not only continue the blatant sexism in the film industry but blame it on Patty if the movie fails, setting female directors up (whom are already told they won’t get hired) so they can have an excuse to say “Oh well, we tried hiring a woman to direct a film and it didn’t work. Lets not do that again.” This film is bigger than just being a superhero movie… It has the ability to bust open the glass ceiling of Hollywood to tell them that yes, superhero movies about women do well and yes, women can not only direct blockbusters but they can do it well. Because I can guarantee you, Patty does it well. PLEASE spread this around and let Warner Brothers know we aren’t going to stand for this bullshit. GO SEE WONDER WOMAN JUNE 2nd!!!  This is a called a glass cliff (when men put women in positions of power + set them up to fail). I hope it doesn’t work this time!

My mother used homeopathy, aromatherapy, osteopathy; we took daily supplements of vitamin C, echinacea, cod liver oil.I had an outdoor lifestyle; I grew up next to a farm in England’s Lake District, walked everywhere, did sports and danced twice a week, drank plenty of water. I wasn’t even allowed pop; even my fresh juice was watered down to protect my teeth, and I would’ve killed for white, shop-bought bread in my lunchbox once in a while and biscuits instead of fruit, like all the other kids.We ate (organic local) meat maybe once or twice a week, and my mother and father cooked everything from scratch—I have yet to taste a Findus crispy pancake, and oven chips (“fries,” to Americans) were reserved for those nights when Mum and Dad had friends over and we got a “treat.”As healthy as my lifestyle seemed, I contracted measles, mumps, rubella, a type of viral meningitis, scarlatina, whooping cough, yearly tonsillitis, and chickenpox.

By its own policies, mission statements and regulations, the EPA, through this man, are required to take into consideration the best science when analyzing compliance with these environmental laws and whether we have an environmental problem that has to be addressed. Not science as interpreted and applied by scientists employed by, and paid by, polluters. Isn’t it time for our elected federal representatives in Congress and the Senate to call this guy out, and somehow figure out a way to remove him from office? I don’t suspect impeachment is available, unless these same politicians can find an impeachable offense, but there has to be a way, in a democracy, to eliminate a bureaucrat who is clearly not interested in protecting the people he is supposed to be protecting. Excerpt:  The Environmental Protection Agency has dismissed at least five members of a major scientific review board, the latest signal of what critics call a campaign by the Trump administration to shrink the agency’s regulatory reach by reducing the role of academic research. A spokesman for the E.P.A. administrator, Scott Pruitt, said he would consider replacing the academic scientists with representatives from industries whose pollution the agency is supposed to regulate, as part of the wide net it plans to cast. “The administrator believes we should have people on this board who understand the impact of regulations on the regulated community,” said the spokesman, J. P. Freire. The dismissals on Friday came about six weeks after the House passed a bill aimed at changing the composition of another E.P.A. scientific review board to include more representation from the corporate world. Some who opposed the dismissals denounced them as part of a broader push by the E.P.A. to downgrade science and elevate business interests. “This is completely part of a multifaceted effort to get science out of the way of a deregulation agenda,” said Ken Kimmell, the president of the Union of Concerned Scientists. “What seems to be premature removals of members of this Board of Science Counselors when the board has come out in favor of the E.P.A. strengthening its climate science, plus the severe cuts to research and development — you have to see all these things as interconnected.” The scientists dismissed from the 18-member Board of Scientific Counselors received emails from an agency official informing them that their three-year terms had expired and would not be renewed. That was contrary, the scientists said, to what they had been told by officials at the agency in January, just before Mr. Trump’s inauguration.   It’s just the beginning. He’s preparing 150 federal court nominations and has 1,352 days to do plenty more damage. " False link

Weeks ago I was interested to read that the phone scam had hit Australia’s shores. I just had lunch with one of the Mackay police station’s Volunteer in Policing who received a “Can you hear me?” phone call at their home number on Monday April 24!! What do you need to know? >Victims receive an unsolicited phone call (business or home number) … after you answer, the scammer will simply say “Can you hear me?” several times.  >Most people say “yes”. >The scammer then ends the call. >It is believed that the scammer is recording your “yes” response and that this recording is being used to authorise payments or charges – in your name!!! Good luck disputing or contesting the payment or charge after the event with a recording of your “yes” on file authorising it  If the scammer already has your mobile phone number and some sensitive identification information of yours… you may have some serious and legitimate reasons to be concerned! We’re now sharing this post statewide as we believe it to be hitting many areas. Our advice to combat this phone scam : Spread the word – Share this information If you receive a “can you hear me?” phone call – hang up – don’t respond! If you did respond with a “yes” … alert your financial institution, begin to monitor your accounts closely .. and contact ID CARE   If you have information for police, contact Policelink on 131 444 or provide information using the online form 24hrs per day. You can report information about crime anonymously to Crime Stoppers, a registered charity and community volunteer organisation, by calling 1800 333 000 or via crimestoppersqld.com.au 24hrs per day.  So the Queensland Police shared this just now, be aware, and you should probably answer the phone with “Who the fuck is this?” for the foreseeable future.   What kind of shitty financial company would accept only a “yes” in your voice though? Usually banks require an actual conversation… " False link
