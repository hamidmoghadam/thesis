I had to get a steroid shot on my butt today because over the counter allergy medication wasn’t doing anything. )’:I’ll be moved in to Texas around the 26th and be right back to work as soon as possible. If I find any downtime during this week to work I’ll do my best to get some stuff out!!  " True text
