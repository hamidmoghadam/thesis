Fortunately, that’s about to change. The European Court of Human Rights ruled this week that forced sterilization laws are a violation of human rights, and that these 22 countries must change their laws.  The affected countries are Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, Finland, Turkey, Latvia, Lithuania, Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. A handful of other European countries have also removed their forced sterilization laws in the past few years.  “Today is a victory for trans people and human rights in Europe,” said Transgender Europe Executive Director Julia Ehrt in a press release. “This decision ends the dark chapter of state-induced sterilization in Europe.” OutRight Action International Executive Director Jessica Stern also applauded the ruling. “Today the world moved in the right direction for trans rights everywhere,” she said. “Forcing unnecessary medical interventions to access basic human rights like legal recognition of a person’s gender is barbaric.” The European Court of Human Rights ruling said forced medical examinations or mental health diagnoses for trans people do not violate the European Convention on Human Rights. “It is regrettable that cruel and unnecessary medical examinations are seen to be in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights,” said Transgender Europe Senior Policy Officer Richard Köhler. “We will continue to raise awareness about the human rights abuses in the medical field that trans people are still systematically subjected to.”  This is a really big deal, and about damn time, too.   [Article posted April 6, 2017] " False link

The EM Drive experimental system could take humans to Mars in just 70 days without the need for rocket fuel, and it’s no exaggeration to say that this could change everything. But before we get too excited (who are we kidding, we’re already freaking out), it’s important to note that these results haven’t been replicated or verified by peer review, so there’s a chance there’s been some kind of error. But so far, despite a thorough attempt to poke holes in the results, the engine seems to hold up.  Continue Reading.   Well, I for one am getting my hopes up.  Warp factor SCHWING.  “Be waiting out front of the HAB, Watney, we’re not fucking waiting for you to get dressed. Places to be.”  Guys. Guys. I’ve been following this story for a while now and you don’t get it. Some guy made this and was like “well hi I made a thing and it shouldn’t go but it goes.” And the science community was like okay that… there’s no way that works. Then they tested it theoretically and it worked.  Then NASA was like okay but technically this breaks one of Newton’s laws so even if it theoretically goes it won’t like, actually go. So they built it and tested it more and it works.  So what we have now is the scientific community slowly cautiously freaking out because this GODDAMN EM DRIVE breaks the RULES OF PHYSICS but every time we test it, it FUCKING WORKS.  How cool is this????  Every time we’ve found something “broken” that functions, it means something is wrong with our understanding of reality. The next step is to figure out what, figure out what’s true, and open up a plethora of new scientific discoveries.  Motherfucking science. I may not be that good at physics but this shit is amazing."

These new guidelines will mean teaching children about diverse family types and the rights movement in second and fourth grade. The California Board of Education unanimously approved the curriculum changes. The law was introduced in 2012, but was held back by disagreements over interpretation and religious and conservative activism. A major complaint of the new provisions is the lack of mention of Native Americans and the concept of manifest destiny, or the policy of integrating Native Americans into the United States.

A 17 year old girl in Korea was kicking ass in Overwatch (made it the eighth in the world) and two pro gamers accused her of hacking. So what did she do? Fucking proved them wrong. She demonstrated her skill on a live stream of a popular Korean streamer to show there was no cheating involved.  SHE WAS JUST THAT GOOD It’s sad that she felt she had to wear a mask to hide her identity during the stream because she was afraid she would be targeted for online bullying. She even gets emotional at the end of the stream because this accusation had weighed so heavily on her. The two “pro gamers” even threatened to quit playing if she was proved to be legit, but Blizzard stood behind her and let those two idiots walk away. I may not play Overwatch, but I know if there was a girl who did this in League, CS:GO, or any other online game she would be accused of the same thing. Now I don’t usually post original content, but this is HUGE for online gaming. No one even batted an eye when Rekkles (Fnatic Marksman in LOL) started in the Pro League of Legends scene at 17,but this girl was targeted as a hacker. For Blizzard to stand behind her is an amazing development in the online gaming community and I hope everyone supports her whether they play Overwatch or not.  Good Job Blizzard. And thank you Gegury for being such a strong person and proving those assholes wrong.  The so-called “Pros” indeed quit. And nothing of value was lost. Also love the comments saying “but but but it wasn’t sexism, this happens to dudes!” Nah, man, I’m 90% sure part of what spurred them was the fact that she’s a teenage girl who beat the crap out of them.  … she’s just d.va i can’t believe this  D.Va literally appears irl, weaker gamers shrivel and flee from the sight.

While the guidelines are not binding, they are actually the Obama administration telling schools that in order to comply with actual legal obligations under real, cited federal law (Title IX, among others), they should stop being shitheads and let trans kids pee where they feel most comfortable.  This is a self-evident fact but not something I ever thought I would live to see an actual governmental entity actually say out loud, in writing, or anywhere else, holy shit. The guidelines use decent, humanizing language and do not require some kind of gender-affirming surgery or other medical intervention to identify transgender folks, and it asserts that  “Under Title IX, there is no medical diagnosis or treatment requirement that students must meet as a prerequisite to being treated consistent with their gender identity,” seriously this is a real thing about fucking time. It does not even require a mental health diagnosis, just self-identification, which is the most basic fucking thing but seriously this is so much more than I expected in the actual document. It even includes specific guidelines about protecting transgender students’ privacy, and states that nonconsensual disclosure of deadnames, ‘sex assignment at birth’, or other such information may violate FERPA and be harmful to students, which we knew but they actually said it.   It isn’t perfect, for example it talks about gender and biological sex both as binaries, but it affirms the basic fucking human rights of transgender individuals and can you believe this is a real thing, because seriously I can not, how lucky we are to be alive right now, seriously because so many folks are not.  Maybe we can finally get past this remedial level ‘please let people live, eat, sleep, pee, and generally do normal human things without being threatened with death or humiliated’ kind of stuff and talk about things more thoughtfully as a nation and a world, can you imagine because I have never.

She completed the 150-question Cattell III B paper, which primarily measures verbal reasoning ability, during her school holidays.“At first, I was really nervous but once I started, it was much easier than I expected it to be and then I relaxed,” she said. “I gave it my best shot.”Her father, Arun Sebastian, a radiologist at Colchester general hospital, said his daughter had spent an entire year talking about the test and had researched IQ test websites herself. “When I heard she had the maximum possible mark, I was overwhelmed, and so was my wife,” he said.Lydia, who is about to start year eight at Colchester County High school for girls, has read all seven Harry Potter books three times and played the violin since aged four.An only child to Mr Sebastian and Erika Kottiath, an associate director at Barclays Bank, she started talking at just six months.“At the time, I was a trainee doctor and my wife was studying chemistry and I was away at the weekends,” said her 43-year-old father. “She used to say a few words to me on the phone.“She also had an early interest in reading. When she was a few years old she was reading books that were for children several years older than her.“We really have done nothing special with her.”Lydia, whose favourite subjects include maths and physics, is now applying to join the Mensa society. Her parents, both originally from Kerala in southern India, say she voluntarily does homework until 8.30pm or 9pm.“We’ve got a fairly laid-back view [about education],” added Mr Sebastian. “If a child is pushed to do something that’s not designed for their age then, personally, I’d feel they they’d be missing out on other things.”" False link
