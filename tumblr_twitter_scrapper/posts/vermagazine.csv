As you may remember, a few weeks ago I had the idea of a magazine for politically interested young people to express their opinions, discuss ideas, share their views and generally have an outlet for their political interest without being deemed “too young” or “too inexperienced” by teachers/parents/adults in general. Your response was phenomenal, I got around 50 applications in just the first few days. Now I am pleased to announce that I have assembled a wonderful team, consisting of 13 writers, 7 ediors and 5 designers! Together, we decided on a new name for our budding zine:  VER - Veritas Et Reformo, which is Latin for truth and reformation. We are still in the process of working on our introductory issue, but if you want to be updated on that, or on ways you can contribute to our project without being on the official team, please follow us on: Tumblr: @vermagazineFacebook: www.facebook.com/veritasetreformoOr track #vermagazine here on tumblr On our tumblr website, you can find updates, ask questions you may have, and learn about our team! Thank you for all of the support, Rachel " False text
