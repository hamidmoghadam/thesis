No forewarning in the casting call, just a dozen of the best aspiring designers chosen and when they meet the models, they happen to be size 12 and above. Of course they’ll cry at first, but Tim Gunn will tell them to get over it and maybe we’ll have some amazing original designs for people the industry usually ignores.  With Christian Siriano as the first guest judge giving everyone single designer who complains the what for  Please let this happen, I only have two dollars, but they are yours if I can have this  ashley nell tipton as the second guest judge who utterly destroys them  if they do this, then they must increase the budget for each designer because larger sized models means more fabric needed means the designers need larger budgets. that’s why the show will never go for it.  @electracopes    Yeah… no.    1. This is a sponsored television program where designers routinely buy/waste more fabric than they’ll ever need on challenges and it’s all on the show’s dime. And it’s all for the art and show of it.  They’ll never even be worn again. Cost is a ridiculous reason to reject creating plus size season… money is irrelevant here.    2. Also, not every type and print is fabric costs the same.  Some are cheaper than others.  If designers can deal with restrictive budgets on the regular PR challenges in order to create something unique and beautiful there’s absolutely no reason why they couldn’t take the same budget and make adjustments to do the same thing for plus size women.   3. At the industry level, the idea that plus size clothes cost SO MUCH MORE than straight sizes has been debunked time and again. It simply doesn’t… especially at the quantities at which they are purchasing fabric for mass production.    4. Costs can also be brought down by cutting patterns out of fabrics in a conscientious way to reduce waste (which designers on PR already do when working with expensive fabrics or limited budgets).   5. The costs of men’s clothes do not vary as drastically as women’s do regardless of their size.  If the fabric cost excuse were genuine, you would expect the same exorbitant price hike reflected there. Big and tall clothes for men are generally within a reasonable range of the lower sizes.      6. Plus size women’s clothes cost more and designers refuse to create plus size clothes not because of cost or any other reasonable difficulties, but because it’s a punitive measure against fat women and because they thus far been able to get away with it.

Doctor finds anecdotal evidence that people are passing kidney stones after riding on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad at Disney World 2. Doctor makes 3-D model of kidney, complete with stones and urine (his own), takes it on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad 60 times 3. “The stones passed 63.89 percent of the time while the kidneys were in the back of the car. When they were in the front, the passage rate was only 16.67 percent. That’s based on only 60 rides on a single coaster, and Wartinger guards his excitement in the journal article: ‘Preliminary study findings support the anecdotal evidence that a ride on a moderate-intensity roller coaster could benefit some patients with small kidney stones.’” 4. “Some rides are going to be more advantageous for some patients than other rides. So I wouldn’t say that the only ride that helps you pass stones is Big Thunder Mountain. That’s grossly inaccurate.” 5. “His advice for now: If you know you have a stone that’s smaller than five millimeters, riding a series of roller coasters could help you pass that stone before it gets to an obstructive size and either causes debilitating colic or requires a $10,000 procedure to try and break it up. And even once a stone is broken up using shock waves, tiny fragments and “dust” remain that need to be passed. The coaster could help with that, too.” SCIENCE: IT WORKS  Update:  “In all, we used 174 kidney stones of varying shapes, sizes and weights to see if each model worked on the same ride and on two other roller coasters,” Wartinger said. “Big Thunder Mountain was the only one that worked. We tried Space Mountain and Aerosmith’s Rock ‘n’ Roller Coaster and both failed.”Wartinger went on to explain that these other rides are too fast and too violent with a G-force that pins the stone into the kidney and doesn’t allow it to pass.“The ideal coaster is rough and quick with some twists and turns, but no upside down or inverted movements,” he said.

Yeah it on kills 1-2 for every 1000…so let’s see if no one had their vaccinations, assuming only 50% of the population got infected …that’s only about 250,000 people who are now alive who would be dead.

Designs for ‘The Big Bend’, a slender tower that would transform Manhattan’s skyline have been unveiled. Described as the ‘longest building in the world’, the project’s concept drawings reveal a skyscraper reaching an apex then curving back down. And featuring an elevator system that can travel in curves, horizontally and in loops.   In a bid to work around the challenges of New York’s zoning laws, design studio Oiio has imagined an innovative concept to straddle across Billionnaire’s Row on 57th Street.  what the fuck is this   It’s why people hate New York.   Oh great there’s going to be a giant fucking paperclip in my skyline. Fucking neato  It looks like you’re baiting disaster!  Would you like help? " False link

I know a realtor who relies strongly on his girlfriend’s charisma, beauty and personality to gain clients. I’ve just been reading The Glass Universe by Dava Sobel, about the Harvard women who supported the bulk of astronomy research there over the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. While many of them did receive public and academic credit as well as pay - although the university always resisted making any of them faculty until the 1950s - almost all the male astronomers featured were married to accomplished women in their own right, many of them scientists, and you can bet their husbands weren’t putting them on all their papers.  Which has bled into the modern academic world, where many people are expected to do what was essentially a two-person job (filled by male academic + wife) by themselves, or while married to someone else trying to do the same thing. The lack of acknowledgement of women’s work fucks everybody over.   #people who want a return to the mythical prior era #when women did not work #do not want women to stop working #they want them to stop getting credit and pay for it  in history, Charles Beard kept insisting on putting Mary Beard’s name on the work they co-authored. he insisted they did equal work; other male academics consistently discussed their work as if Charles alone had done it and tried to ignore her. they wrote reviews that only mentioned his name, etc. he was breaking the unspoken gentleman’s agreement: you exploit your wife’s labor and don’t credit her, or else the rest of us might have to start crediting our wives " False link

Emma was dressed for this scene. Belle was not.” (They are SO fucking dumb for giving her so much control! The fuck does she know? …Nothing, clearly.)  @ithotyouknew2 look at these edges and that trim oh my god?  If I were that costume designer, I would’ve quit on the spot like who the fuck does she think she is coming and overpowering another woman’s gig and knowledge and wow I feel so sorry for the whole department cause lord knows I would be blacklisted after the fit I’d throw if she tried that with me.  Like my god is that fabric from Joann? Look at the puckering on the hems you can tell they gave up.  Right? Bitch you are you? Can you sew? You can’t even act! The hems have a decorative stitch on the bottom but like why is it SO puckered overall? And there’s GLUE. GLUE ALL OVER IT. THEY JUST… Like they HAD a budget, wtf happened? Did she have them change it over and over again to the point that they had no time left or what?  The decorative edging on the tiers would look better in a different fabric and if they had gathered the skirt but this just looks like it needs to be steamed and that glitter? Like…I’m….so mad about that glitter? 300 million dollars and they used some hobby lobby craft glitter? And glue? With a delicate fabric? With tiers you can SEE? Even the glitter dots could’ve been a crystal, something to add dimension but they really stenciled on some damn designs like a downtown la knock off of a couture gown like my god I am so pissed. Now I feel sorry for that designer. She has her name on this forever I’m glad they’re letting us know Emma did the most but I can’t believe that they would let her choose the methods of construction too like someone has to be to blame for that. This dress looks like it costs about 299.99.  That dress looks like a festive napkin :/  You know how sometimes Project Runway will do two-day challenges, and all the designers practically orgasm on the spot and start making overly grand plans for what they can accomplish in that still-limited time? And some people do thrive, but others inevitably waste the whole first day, panic, completely restart, are still in mid-construction when their models come in for a final fitting, and end up sending their models to hair and makeup on their own because they just snagged the hem on this chiffon and they can’t give up a second of time to step away from the Brother™ Sewing Room?This looks like it came straight from a Disney Princess challenge, from the person who regrets taking the “easy” Belle pick when their name was drawn first from the button bag."

But it started when a  16-year-old high school student in Canada decided Yiannopoulos was  embraced much too closely by mainstream conservatives. The teen was moved to dig up footage on Yiannopoulos when  she heard that he’d been invited to speak at the highest profile  gathering of conservatives each year in America, the 2017 Conservative  Political Action Conference (CPAC). She defines herself as “very  socially liberal,” but leans right on economics and foreign policy.  Yiannopoulos, who has built his personal brand on anti-Muslim,  anti-feminism, and general bigotry, exemplifies the place where she  doesn’t believe the conservative movement should go. “I see Milo as this embodiment of the awfulness you see  over the past few years with the general tilt of millennial  conservatism,” said the teen. “It’s diverged from this traditional  conservatism so much. You’ve seen it essentially become full of  awfulness and all about attacking the left and not about actual  principles. It has nothing to do with conservative ideology so much as  it has with opposing the leftists, SJWs, and so on and so forth.” […] Julia closely follows political news from her home in  Canada, with a deep interest in American politics. She has been  particularly alarmed by the recent rise of Yiannopoulos and others like  him. So as soon as she heard Yiannopoulos would speak at CPAC, she was  appalled.  Then an old moment popped in her head. She remembered hearing an obscure podcast, the Drunken Peasants, in which Yiannopoulos, responding to a video by YouTube pundit Kevin Logan,  defended the idea of “13-year-olds” having sex with “older men,”  arguing that child molestation provided a “sort of ‘coming of age’  relationship” for teenagers.  Her memory was right. She found the July 2016 clip. She didn’t think she’d have much luck spreading the news  herself with her small Twitter following, so she contacted a  conservative outlet to get the story out. She figured a liberal outlet  would have less credibility among CPAC followers.  She landed on the previously not-very-well-known  conservative blog Reagan Battalion, which, after a bit of back and  forth, tweeted out the video — leading not just to CPAC canceling  Yiannopoulos’s speech, but to Simon & Schuster pulling his already  controversial book deal and his resignation from Breitbart. “I thought it would only get, like, 200 retweets,” Julia said. “I had no idea that it would blow up to the extent that it did.” It ended up at thousands of retweets.

Teeth already have the capability of regenerating dentine if the pulp inside the tooth becomes exposed through a trauma or infection, but can only naturally make a very thin layer, and not enough to fill the deep cavities caused by tooth decay.  But Tideglusib switches off an enzyme called GSK-3 which prevents dentine from carrying on forming.  Scientists showed it is possible to soak a small biodegradable sponge with the drug and insert it into a cavity, where it triggers the growth of dentine and repairs the damage within six weeks.  The tiny sponges are made out of collagen so they melt away over time, leaving only the repaired tooth.  That is by far the coolest thing I’ve heard this year. " False link
