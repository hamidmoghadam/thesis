Don’t think about how after she realized what a giant mistake it was to let him go into Mount Weather she was never willing to lose him again. Don’t think about how she put his life before humanity’s survival. Don’t think about how he reciprocated that need when he said “If I’m on that list, you’re on that list.” They didn’t want to live without one another. They never wanted to part again. Don’t think about how Bellamy lost his last piece of hope as he took off in that spaceship. “Do you still have hope? We’re still breathing aren’t we?” Don’t think about how alone and distressed Clarke felt in those six years. “I can’t lose you too ok?” Don’t think about how Bellamy heard those words in a loop inside his head as he said “I left her behind. I left her behind and we all die anyway.” Don’t think about how guilty he feels. Don’t think about how devastated Clarke feels when she utters “It’s been safe for you to come down for over a year now. Why haven’t you?” Why haven’t you?

My goal is to raise awareness for people suffering with chronic illnesses/pain and/or physical disabilities. I also want to use this blog to keep raising awareness after my hike on August 20th. To do that, I’d like you all to help me populate the tabs ready and waiting on this blog.  FUNDRAISERS Are you planning a fundraiser of your own? Would you like to plan a fundraiser? Let me know! I’d love to speak with you about it, and help you spread the word via this blog and across social media (obviously, I support fundraisers in general but the focus of this blog is chronic and physical health conditions - and all the factors therein - so do bear that in mind).  TESTIMONIALS Each person’s experience with illness or disability is different. My voice isn’t enough. I would love for you guys to share your stories, and for those stories to inspire conversations. If you would like to do so then please send this blog an ask or - if it’s easier - send an email to doitforraven@gmail.com.  CHARACTERS I would also love to champion characters other than Raven, and the minds that created them, that represent the physically disabled. While there aren’t enough characters, they do exist. We should do what we can to make those characters, who might be lost in the shuffle, accessible to a wider audience. Again, you can submit and talk about characters that have impacted you via asks or via doitforraven@gmail.com.  I understand that not everybody will be able to donate, but I do hope that you will at least reblog. Witnessing Raven’s journey truly helped me, in more ways than one. If raising awareness of her, of other characters, of real people and their stories, can help others - then why not chip in by spreading the word?  So, I guess today is the day? I’d love for all of my followers to do one of two things with this, pretty please. Give the #doitforraven blog a follow. I’d love to curate a space there which people can use as both resource and outlet. And if you do not have a chronic illness or disability, then you might learn something so still worth a follow? I would also greatly appreciate it if you could share the fundraiser allll over the place. If you can’t donate, I understand, but please help spread the word. " False link

Practically, approval of this motion does little more than send a message of solidarity to the Muslim community. I’m not normally into platitudes, but as a Muslim, I was shaken by the spike in hate crimes both in Canada and the U.S. that immediately followed the election of Donald Trump. After he took office, he issued a travel ban directed at Muslim-majority nations; that same weekend, a man who believed immigration posed a threat to the white race opened fire on a mosque in Quebec. So any expression of recognition that anti-Muslim sentiment is at a frightening level is a comfort to me. Not so comforting? The reaction to this motion by some Conservatives, including some hoping to lead that party, who used it as a way to pander to racists.  Continue Reading.  M-103 : Systemic racism and religious discrimination   Text of the Motion:  That, in the opinion of the House, the government should: (a) recognize the need to quell the increasing public climate of hate and fear; (b)  condemn Islamophobia and all forms of systemic racism and religious  discrimination and take note of House of Commons’ petition e-411 and the  issues raised by it; and © request that the Standing Committee  on Canadian Heritage undertake a study on how the government could (i)  develop a whole-of-government approach to reducing or eliminating  systemic racism and religious discrimination including Islamophobia, in  Canada, while ensuring a community-centered focus with a holistic  response through evidence-based policy-making, (ii) collect data to  contextualize hate crime reports and to conduct needs assessments for  impacted communities, and that the Committee should present its findings  and recommendations to the House no later than 240 calendar days from  the adoption of this motion, provided that in its report, the Committee  should make recommendations that the government may use to better  reflect the enshrined rights and freedoms in the Constitution Acts,  including the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.   Canada censoring free speech forever and always, nothing new there. @sidelinesofcode​    It’s a non binding motion (Its not a bill). It does not change any laws. It will do absolutely nothing to freedom of speech. If you had read the article you would know that.  i did read the article. and even if it isn’t binding, it still attacks free speech (and yes, ‘‘hate speech’‘ is part of free speech). This is giving too much power to the government, way too much power. And it’s by creating such motions that little by little the people will lose their freedom.  Explain how a non-binding motion that does not create any new laws in any way attacks freedom of the speech?All it is asking that a bunch of politicians say that they condemn islamophobia, other religious discrimination and systematic racism. They’re not being forced to do it. Many politicians are not voting for the motion. That is their freedom of choice; their freedom of speech.It does not force any politician to do anything. It does not force any individual to do anything. It is an entirely voluntary and entirely symbolic motion. Canadian government: *considers - literally just thinks about - purely symbolically wagging its finger at Islamophobes and white supremacists for publicly spreading their bigoted propaganda*Some 23 year old “wannabe anarchist” who thinks taxation is theft: this is how freedom dies" False link
