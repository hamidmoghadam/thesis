Myself and every other cop I know does NOT pay for a burglar alarm  monitoring service. Why you ask? Because most burglars are in and out in  under 5 minutes. The alarm company has to call the house, then after  they dont get an answer, they call the police. Then the dispatch center  has to get the details, set up the call, and dispatch an officer. The  quickest I have ever seen this process is about 8-10 minutes from the  door being breached to an officer on scene. If you want to make your house more secure, you can do a few things  that burglars notice. a very large dog bowl at the front and back doors  gets noticed, even if you dont have a dog. Also burglars avoid detection  at all costs. Very obvious camera placement is a very good deterrent.  Also wifi doorbells that have two way communication work well. There are  many more, but alarm monitoring is a waste of money. Edit*** Since people have asked me what is a good set up for home  security without paying a monthly fee….I am a big fan of smart home  technology….I specifically go with smartthings. I can trigger lights  based on motion sensors, I have wifi enabled cameras that I can access  on my smartphone that can trigger lights and alert my phone. I still  have an alarm system in my home, I just dont pay to have it monitored.  Everything I listed does not have a monthly fee. Basically I am the  monitoring service for my home, and im much quicker than a dispatcher  calling another dispatcher." False text

If you’ve got an odd number that doesn’t fit in  the sequence, you can also just round to the nearest Fibonacci number  and compensate for this in the answer. E.g. 70 mi ≈ 80 mi. 80 mi = 130  km. Subtract a small value like 15 km to compensate for the rounding,  and the end result is 115 km.This works because the Fibonacci sequence increases following the  golden ratio (1:1.618). The ratio between miles and km is 1:1.609, or  very, very close to the golden ratio. Hence, the Fibonacci sequence  provides very good approximations when converting between km and miles."
