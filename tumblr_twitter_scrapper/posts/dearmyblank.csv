I’m going to Rome tomorrow, which you already know, and I’ll miss you.  I will miss your birthday, which makes me sad, but knowing that you will be surrounded by people who love and care about you gives me peace. I’ll send postcards for the time that I’m in Rome just so that you don’t have to worry.  Whenever we meet, our lives become such a cliche. From the time we drove around top down in your convertible in the city and in the hill country to us arguing along the bridge in the city and you fixing the little scab that I had on my forehead, my friends expected us to be romantically together. I don’t think that will ever happen because we are just not that way. We hold hands and hug, and everything just unfolds naturally and comfortably around you. While we admit that we care deeply for one another, we also admitted to not having romantic feelings for one another.  You know how to contact me while I’m away. Keep an eye out for a package of chocolates this summer.  Love, Me." True text

These are not at all true.The people around me hold hands with horrific and beautiful things- terrible, rotting bodies with maggots crawling from their toothless grins, women with thin faces, sharp teeth, red eyes, and flowing hair, giant animals that have no shadow but cause a great burden as they climb on the back of their owners- their slaves. Some people’s demons cannot be seen. They walk with their heads held high and smiles on their faces. But they are the most dangerous. They have the demons that they choke on in moments of silence. The demons that rip you up from the inside. The demons that pull your lips up to smile, despite the echoes of screams bouncing in your head.This is what I have.I walk in a world that is eternally and unequivocally against me.My body is always on the verge of giving out, my mind a step away from numbness. My unseen demon laughs at my struggles, convincing me that I am my worst fears. “Worthless.”“You’ll never be as good as them.”“Don’t you see that you’ll always be stuck in the constant struggle that is your life?”“Look at all of those people that are ahead of you. You will never catch up.”“Everyone looks down on you and is so disappointed in you.”“Go look at yourself in the mirror and decide again if you want to eat.”“No wonder people always leave you.”“You will NEVER do anything meaningful or important. Just make it easier for everyone and give up.” My heartbeat slows as I lose my battle. It seems the demon has won.Then, a light. A light that is so bright my demons shy away. The light that comes from inside- the determination to prove that I am worth more than my skin and bones. And though I still hear the voices in my ears of the demons who have long since lost, they still overwhelm me sometimes- and the battle will resume. I don’t always win, but I do always recover. I suppose that itself is winning the war. Now I walk and see those with the demons that are not so obvious. The ones with bugs crawling in their ears. I offer them help. I offer them love and kindness. I offer them what I needed, though no one seemed to give it to me. Some have not existed under the conditions in which they have become as strong as I have, so I am strong for them. I do not mind the extra demons, friends. They provide me company as I walk alone. ~atlas (i’m back, loves.)" True text

I have a very limited amount of time, but from what I have I will introduce myself, my story, and why I am looking for a reason to continue on my journey - it’s similar to your dilemma.  I am a 16 year old girl living in Western Manhattan. My parents are immigrants from Russia and both of them play in the New York Philharmonic. Both of them have influenced me tremendously, I’ve been exposed to music since I was born. In fact, my whole entire life revolves around music. I’ve attended private music-focused schools for as long as I can remember and I’ve played the violin since I was 3. Unfortunately, I’ve always felt like I’m only doing this because it’s what my parents want. To be truthful, I don’t know if I want to study music for the rest of my life. I don’t hate it, but I don’t like it either. I don’t even know if I find joy in any activity. Whenever I suggest that I might have a different career, my parents scold me. They say that it is a waste of my talent and potential. On top of this, I know that I’m basically guaranteed a spot in Julliard, which makes me feel even worse. If I had more time to think about my future, I would. Unfortunately, I don’t have any time to do that. Ever since I started high school, I’ve been practicing for at least 5 hours a day. On top of school work, it’s exhausting, but my parents say that my hard work will pay off in the future. I want to make my parents happy, but I know that a career in music isn’t what I want. How can I figure out what I want when I don’t have enough time to understand what I want? Should I continue my path, knowing that I will succeed, or should I start over and make a new one? With love, The confused girl from New York City" True link
