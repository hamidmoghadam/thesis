And while he often butted heads with Jim Gordon, he also was a mentor and a father figure to the young detective. Plus, his unwavering moral code showed Gordon that you can make a positive impact on the city without resorting to bribery, extortion, and questionable alliances with the underworld.However, once Barnes was infected with the Alice Tetch virus, it brought the darkness lurking deep inside him to the surface. As Executive Producer John Stephens explains to us: “His desire for justice overwhelmed his ethical code, and transformed into the Executioner, summarily hunting down, trying and executing criminals whom he deems guilty.”Head down to our gallery to check out exclusive images of Barnes dressed in his Executioner costume, which features a Mad Max-like leather get-up, a menacing blade replacing his left hand, and exaggerated charcoal eye makeup that reminds me of Daryl Hannah’s look for Priscilla “Pris” Stratton in Blade Runner.You’ll have to tune in this Monday to see Barnes transformation, though I’m sure Indian Hill mad scientist Dr. Hugo Strange is to blame.In the comics, Batman and Robin fought a criminal who used the identity of the Executioner. His real name was Willy Hooker and worked at a carnival. To make an extra buck, he would break criminals out of jail and then kill them so that he could collect the reward money. He only appeared in one issue: Detective Comics #191 (January 1953)." True text

But their search is interrupted by Barnes, who has been sent after Gordon by Kathryn. Wearing a ridiculous leather jumpsuit, and an axe on his arm kinda like the titular villain in “Batman: Mask of the Phantasm,” Barnes has fully embraced his virus-fueled identity as the Executioner and is determined to punish Gordon for his perceived crimes. Honestly, I was biased against this story from the start. I have never liked the way the show has written the balance of blame in the disintegration of Gordon and Barnes’ relationship, or the attitude Gordon has consistently given him. And Michael Chiklis hasn’t been able to make the character’s over-the-top turn work the way actors like Cory Michael Smith and Erin Richards have. But watching the episode, it’s also clear that it’s just a stall in the overarching Court of Owls arc and that made it even more boring to me.In the more interesting subplots, the reunion between the Penguin and the Riddler isn’t a bygones-y one, but the friends-turned-foes soon realize they’ll need to work together if they want to best the Court of Owls. The shaman continues to manipulate Bruce and, to that end, shares a secret about his connection to the Court. Alfred goes on the warpath after finding out about “Five.” And Leslie’s grief takes her down a self-destructive path. All four stories have their moments, but it’s the Bruce and Leslie ones that travel to particularly intriguing places." True link

Approximately a million things happen this week, some of them are entertaining, a few even make sense. Mainly, this episode is just bonkers. Let’s begin…Jim’s still desperately trying to find the Court of Owls’ weapon, with Harvey by his side and Barnes on his tail. I know the early case-of-the-week format isn’t exactly popular, but there’s real pleasure to be had in watching Jim and Harvey work together here and know that Harvey will always have Jimbo’s back, whatever trouble he gets into. In fact, this is a great episode for Harvey, with writer Ken Woodruff really nailing his self-deprecating humour and his increasing disbelief at the chaos unfolding. The plot? Crystal owls, explosions, that sort of thing. Don’t look at it too closely.As much as I like Michael Chiklis, the whole Executioner storyline is rather too broad and silly for me to enjoy: the one thing Gotham can normally be relied up on to do is create compelling multi-faceted villains, so the Executioner plotline is something of a let-down. However, I appreciate a) the wild spread of destruction Barnes leaves in his wake here; and b) the shocking moment that lets us know Barnes is very much his own man and not the Court’s weapon to control.Last week’s epic Oswald/Edward stare-down promised great things. It’s a shame that the main event this week is a shallow affair, relying on the pair sniping at each other and trading insults. Where did you go, emotional nuance?It’s also a little jarring to hear Ed - a man who was so cut up over the loss of Oswald that he took hallucinogenic drugs - went on a murder spree and started wearing a deeply unfortunate hat, casually talking about killing Oswald again. Is this Ed’s repression talking? Is he so far gone now that it simply doesn’t matter anymore? Or is it just a case of ‘plot imperative’? Everybody line up, Airplane style, to slap some sense into him.The chemistry here is such that the jail-break storyline could never be boring, but it is rather unsatisfying overall. Gotham has devoted a lot of time this season to the peaks and troughs of this relationship, and to have their big reunion seem so ultimately throwaway is a waste.You guys, Gotham trolled us. Remember how relieved I was last week for them to be moving somewhere new with the Bruce storyline? Well, surprise! That “somewhere new” involves them doing pretty much the same thing, only back in Gotham. If I never see those vision needles again, it will be too soon. The good news is that we do finally get an idea of the Shaman’s long-game. The bad news is that Bruce seems entirely enthralled with the guy. This will not end well. On the plus side, what we’re starting to see here is that the Court is merely a front for something much bigger and much more powerful. Their days in charge of Gotham might be numbered.I’ve probably moaned for long enough, so let’s talk about something REALLY good: the visceral early fight between clone Bruce, Selina, and Alfred. Yes, the cat is out of the bag. Alfred’s response to Bruce’s abduction is to get Old Testament levels of angry and violent, which is oddly satisfying. Scary, but satisfying. You do not come between Alfred and Bruce and get away with it and Alfred’s ferocious pursuit of his missing ward makes me wish Sean Pertwee got more to do.Also good? Jervis Tetch. So repellent and yet so compelling.And then, before we go, the final scene brings us a character making a decision so bad that I literally face-palmed right onto my coffee table.

When actor David Mazouz spoke to CinemaBlend recently about Bruce’s downward spiral, he told me things are only getting way darker. But could things go so wrong that Bruce actually kills someone? It’s not clear, but it sure sounds like it. In Mazouz’s words:[Bruce] is so desperate to find the answer that he believes what these new influences in his life have to tell him. He is going to be conditioned in a way that it looks like he will never be able to return, and I don’t know that he ever fully will be able to return. And maybe that’s why he eventually chooses to put on the cape and cowl. But your question of ‘Will he take these destructive forces back to Gotham City when he eventually returns?,’ the answer is completely yes. He will be a completely new person. And in order to break away from that, he will have to be stripped down to his most bare and vulnerable state in order to build himself back up again as the man that we know from Batman, and the man that we started to see him become before this transformation. But throughout this transformation he will be stripped of all of his morals and it will take a great deal of effort and time and support from his loving characters around him to get back on the right track.Now, if you describe just about anyone else in Gotham City as being vulnerable and without morals, you’re not going to have a hard time imagining that character committing a murder or two. This show seriously has far more leads who are guilty of killing others than those innocent of it. But again, this is Bruce Wayne we’re talking about, and Batman is one of the only fictional heroes out there who has repeatedly made declarations that killing people was not his M.O. for bringing justice to the world. But let’s not forget that Batman is nowhere near the events of this series yet, and Bruce Wayne is currently a teenager whose body and personality are equally malleable to those in an advantageous position. So if he’s currently being developed into a Gotham-destroying warrior, how could he possibly take the city down without dropping a few bodies?Of course, it would have been a lot cooler if David Mazouz had specifically referenced Bruce punching someone’s throat out or running over a villain with a car, but we all know actors can’t get quite so loose-lipped with their upcoming twists. And in any case, no one really expects Bruce Wayne to become a killing machine on Gotham, so there are other logical steps to take with that information. (Such as…well…maybe Bruce could give Jim Gordon a wicked big wedgie.) In fact, it wasn’t that long ago in Season 3 when Bruce had the chance to kill his tormenter Jerome, but he refused to go down that non-retractable route.Still, even with all the reasons against, it’d be one thing if David Mazouz had made only a passing reference to Bruce turning into a less virtuous citizen of Gotham City, but he drove that point home. It could have been passionate enthusiasm, of course, but I choose to think conspiratorially in this case. Especially since Mazouz continued down that same speculation-friendly path when talking about Bruce’s current sense of “goodness.”I don’t think Bruce is all good. I think there is a great deal of darkness in him. There are evil urges inside of him also. I feel like that’s really what makes him so flawed, and not just in Gotham, but in all of Batman’s incarnations. He, of course, has a really strong moral compass. At the same time, I feel like he has the capability of knowing what it is to be bad. But I feel like with all of our characters, good and bad, we see hints of the other side.Great deal of darkness inside or not, viewers haven’t really gotten a chance to see that side of him play out in a way that affects anyone beyond himself. Sure, we know he’s a depressed dude because of his parents’ death and the havoc that followed, but he doesn’t ever expel that darkness out into the world the same way that Penguin or even Selina does. It’s apparently going to happen soon, though, and it’ll probably look pretty badass, too. And my biggest question then will be the same as it is now: is Bruce going to kill someone?" True link
justgotham 160781586857 "2017-05-17 22:19:10 GMT" http://justgotham.tumblr.com/post/160781586857/why-queerbaiting-accusations-baffled-gotham "When it premiered in 2014, the premise of Gotham was easy to explain: the show is a prequel to the Batman mythology as comic book readers, animated series watchers, and moviegoers already know it. It’s telling not just the origin story of Bruce Wayne’s alter ego, but the origin stories of the theatrical, malevolent bad guys who’ll plague his version of the city. And perhaps the most sympathetic downward spiral has been the transformation of umbrella boy Oswald Cobblepot into the criminal mastermind known as Penguin. Gotham added another step past the point of no return for Oswald this season when he was jilted (and nearly murdered) by Edward Nygma (Cory Michael Smith), who Oswald claimed to be in love with. For both characters to stay on their trajectory towards city-threatening super-villainy, they couldn’t have a happy ending. Yet some Gotham fans cried “queerbaiting” on social media when the relationship was never consummated. In an interview at Bustle HQ, Robin Lord Taylor says that “queerbaiting” accusations “baffled” him. Homophobic backlash, he sadly anticipated. But not that.“So, of course I expect ‘f*ggot this’ and 'gay that,’ and 'they ruined the show,’” Taylor says. “We had a little of that. But on the other hand, I was not expecting on the progressive side of things, still that same exact insistence on putting people into a definable box — into a box that [viewers] can also identify with — as opposed to letting an experience happen.”Taylor is protective of Oswald, murderer though he may be, but more protective of presenting an authentic experience. As he talks about his character’s romantic awakening and some fans’ perception that the show had cultivated 'shipping via performative homosexuality with no intent of “following through,” he leans forward in his chair and punctuates his words by lightly punishing the tabletop.The criticism is especially frustrating to Taylor because since he heard from the writers that Oswald would be developing these feelings, he’s taken an active role in helping the show tell a story that doesn’t “ring false.” When I ask him how he first reacted to the pitch, he chooses his words carefully and gives me the fears first.“My big concern was like, OK so, this is the first time I’ve heard about any sort of alternative sexuality to Oswald, be it anywhere on the spectrum,” Taylor says. “Even any mention of any sort of romantic interest. I myself am gay, so I knew that this is not going to be a traditional story of someone coming out of the closet.”While other Gotham baddies want power more than anything, power is just a vehicle for Oswald to achieve something else: validation and love. Taylor sees the former Gotham City mayor as a person who’s “very emotionally, physically, sexually immature,” possibly because his self-worth “has been beaten out of him” after years of abuse and ostracization.“I wanted to be true to what I know and understand of human sexuality and it’s not that you” — he snaps his fingers — “wake up one day, and you are gay. And to say that you are gay means that you identify with a group of people; it’s a cultural thing,” Taylor says.For him, Oswald doesn’t claim that orientation, nor any other. Taylor was determined to keep his character’s discovery “a romantic, yearning need to connect with somebody” rather than strictly sexual interest, because Oswald’s understanding of himself is so limited.“It was the Riddler — the first person who showed any respect or understanding or even enjoyment of Oswald’s company,” the actor says. “Who’s to say that if it was Barbara that it couldn’t have been her? I wanted to keep that ambiguous. Because what I understand of my own personal experience being gay… this is something that I’ve been thinking about my entire life. It’s always been a part of my life.”Of course, Oswald’s wooing of Ed didn’t go exactly as planned. (Isn’t it just like the Penguin to kill the competition to get her out of his way?) But Taylor says these two characters are inextricably linked to each other, even if Nygmobblepot 'shippers should get used to the idea that there’s no white picket fence on the horizon.“It’s a one-sided romance thing, but in [the April 24 episode], it’s when the Riddler announces himself and he’s taking pills and he’s having hallucinations and he’s hallucinating Oswald and you can see in those exchanges — not romantically, he didn’t have that for Oswald — but there still was a love and a respect and a need on his part too to connect with him,” Taylor says.You’ll remember that scene: it’s where Ed has a vision of his old friend Oswald singing a sultry Amy Winehouse song. (They recorded his vocals, by the way, in the same studio where Winehouse laid down hers — an experience Taylor says made him ask himself, “What the hell am I doing?”)“If you watch it back and you notice: this is the first time you see Oswald in the traditional tux and tails and top hat, which is the traditional Penguin look,” Taylor says. “And I love that he didn’t come up with that look initially. That was the Riddler. So it’s almost like Riddler created part of me. And they’ve created each other, there is no one without the other.”It’s the coexistence of their kinship and their bad blood that make Riddler and Penguin quintessential Gotham bad guys. And that brings Taylor back to the misguided complaints that those crazy two kids just can’t make it work.“It’s never going to be the show where people live and fall in love and live happily ever after. This is a story about how these people become psychopaths,” he says. That’s the theme of the series for the actor: “What happens when love is ripped away? When the access to love or to be gentle or be respectful — when connection between two humans — when that is ripped away, what’s left after that? And in this case, this is how these people go from villains to super-villains.”It wouldn’t be Gotham if it were populated with happy, fulfilled people. This heartbreak is bringing Oswald ever closer to the villain fans know from Bruce Wayne’s canonical future, and his new alliance with Dr. Strange’s “freaks” is a part of that. But in spite the vast range of reactions to Oswald’s Season 3 arc, the actor is pleased that it provoked a reaction at all.“What I love about it is that it created this much bigger conversation,” Taylor sums up. “I’m talking about queer politics. I’m talking about where people fall on the spectrum. This is a giant conversation that we’re having, that’s originating in a Batman story.”Even a heightened world like Gotham’s can still have a lot to say about the world we live in, and Robin Lord Taylor is determined to keep it (close to) real."

Season 3 has been particularly fruitful in laying out the stepping stones for Mazouz’s Bruce Wayne to reach Batman-dom, and especially where his fisticuffs are concerned. The actor spoke with CinemaBlend about Bruce’s journey and his current training sessions with the mysterious Shaman, and I was pumped to hear that the best is yet to come where fights are concerned. Is Mazouz’s words:[Something] I’ve found very exciting this year is how many fight things I’ve been getting to do. I feel like, especially towards the end of this season, every episode I had at least two or three fight sequences, and it’s not gonna stop until the end. So Bruce really gets out there. He really kicks some butt. His physical game, and emotional and mental game, really get trained especially in the episodes we’re nearing on now, and he becomes really a new person by the end of the season.Now, we shouldn’t expect that “new person” to have a utility belt or any mammal-related vehicles, but it appears that whatever Bruce goes through while inside the Shaman’s temple (or whatever) is going to put vengeance-embracing character through one wringer of a transition before Season 4 comes around. But at least he’ll be throwing uppercuts and leg-sweeping people while going through that wringer. After all, one of Gotham’s best fight sequences yet was Bruce’s street battle with Selina’s law-skirting colleagues, which looked a lot cleaner than a lot of Jim’s sloppy brawls. So if the show can manage to work more of those into the episodes while also upping the ante as Bruce’s training continues, then that’ll be yet another layer of enjoyment for Gotham to give fans.Viewers have gotten a taste of where his training is going, and the Shaman seems patient to wait for Bruce to just embrace it and improve without resisting. Since it’s unclear just how long Bruce will be hanging around this new and completely cut-off setting, I asked David Mazouz if we would see Bruce punching bad guys in the face back in Gotham City before the end of the season, and his answer was quite intriguing (and thankfully not as puzzling as The Riddler’s clues).All I’ll say is that he will get into some real fights. And he will take some criminals down.There are several ways to read into that, and one of them is that Bruce might not make it all the way back to his hometown this season. He’s quite a distance from it right now, and even though the show hasn’t referred to it directly, the mountains outside the Shaman’s headquarters hints at Ra’s al Ghul’s stomping grounds of Nanda Parbat, so is it possible that the League of Assassins leader will be one of the criminals Bruce takes down?"

This could describe just  about any episode of Gotham, but it’s particularly true this week. His  new place on the Court of Owls may grant him access, but he’s still out  of the loop on the details surrounding their grand scheme to destroy  Gotham. With Harvey’s assistance, Jim’s on a mission to uncover their  plans and save the city.The reveal of the Court’s plans probably won’t come  as a surprise to most people, but I’m happy enough for this to be  predictable given that it promises great drama and chaos, AND brings  back both Hugo Strange and Barnes into play. Strange, still wonderfully  eerie, is a wildcard who may find himself highly sought after by the  various factions in play.Adding to Jim’s problems is Leslie, whose  Jim-related issues have now reached the vendetta stage. Leslie is  rightfully paranoid – Jim and co. really are hiding things from her,  after all – and it’s understandable that her bitterness towards Jim  would see her interpret things in the worst possible way. However, I’m  never impressed by a storyline that involves people keeping unnecessary  secrets to manufacture drama, and it seems a waste of Morena Baccarin’s  talents to have her play the role of a Dementor in seemingly every  scene.Meanwhile, Oswald’s revenge plan has hit a speed  bump, what with Ed being AWOL. Oswald’s a smart little cookie, so he  soon makes his way to Jim’s door for the two to exchange a conversation  that’s pretty much a greatest hits compilation of their relationship:  veiled threats, requests for favours, rough grabbing, and an absence of  personal space. Welcome back, weird, compelling Jim/Oswald dynamic, I  have missed you dearly.Oswald will end the episode a) in a spot of bother  and b) with another (highly anticipated) reunion. Given the depth of  tension and emotion on show in just this brief scene, I’m really looking  forward to seeing how things play out here, and where Gotham decides to  eventually take perhaps their richest relationship. In the meantime:  reluctant, snarky team-up please, Gotham. Do it for me.Selina wasn’t looking in the best of shape last  time we saw her. Luckily Ivy, clearly now the patron saint of pint-sized  supervillains, is trying to track down her missing friend. There’s a  danger of Ivy and her plants becoming a bit of a lazy ‘deus ex machina’  here: I can just about buy Ivy managing to nurse Oswald through his  gunshot wound, but I’m rather more dubious about the critically injured  Selina. Nonetheless, I’m impressed by how the show has managed to  position this previously rather underused character as the heart of the  show. This being Gotham, I’m certain they’ll find a way to turn her into an embittered, hollow husk of herself sometime soon. Until then…enjoy it.And finally, Bruce, whose training continues. I’m  still not finding these scenes particularly scintillating, although I  have to praise the interesting stylistic choices they made for this  week’s visions. Thankfully, it seems the show is similarly bored of it:  this episode brings the first stage of Bruce’s training to a close, and –  in a welcome move – gives him back some agency in deciding his future.This week represents a great episode for Ben  McKenzie’s Jim, somebody the show has often failed to make compelling in  his own right. The other subplots feel a little more like filler, but  provide some emotional balance to the high-stakes events taking place in  Jim’s investigations." True link

Are they an evil shadow organization out to destroy Gotham City, or are they there to help?In this week’s episode, Gordon is stuck between mourning his Uncle Frank and deciding what to do about the Court of Owls. His uncle killed himself to save Gordon, but there’s no path that doesn’t lead back to the Court. He will need to meet with them, but will he join their group? The elephant in the room is that Gordon knows Frank put the hit out on his father, sanctioned by the Court. Carmine Falcone paid for the lawyer who represented the guy who killed him. Gordon can’t deny that something is very wrong with this picture, but there’s no clear path to culpability.Clone Bruce has settled into life at Wayne Manor, but Alfred is starting to see some personality quirks that didn’t exist before in Young Master Bruce. Are these quirks the result of his shattered relationship with Selina, or is it something else? Alfred is a very smart man, but will he put the pieces together?Meanwhile, the Riddler is on a mission to become the top villain in Gotham City, but will he be successful in his quest? And will the other villains in Gotham City allow the Riddler to continue the rise to power? Ivy and Penguin are making their way back to the city and Penguin is quite happy with his new friend. They might be a formidable duo against not only the Riddler, but Barbara Keane and Tabitha." True link
