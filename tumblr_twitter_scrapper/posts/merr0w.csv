So, I don’t know if you’ve heard but the Wonder Woman film comes out June 2nd… And if you didn’t know that, there’s a reason for it. Warner Brothers aren’t spending money on promoting the Wonder Woman film. No tv promotions, billboards, nothing. A film about a strong, powerful, amazing woman superhero directed by Patty Jenkins who happens to be the first woman to direct a superhero film with a female protagonist and one of only a handful (a literal handful… you can count on one hand) to direct a superhero film at all. They are setting it up to fail so they can say “I told you so” and not only continue the blatant sexism in the film industry but blame it on Patty if the movie fails, setting female directors up (whom are already told they won’t get hired) so they can have an excuse to say “Oh well, we tried hiring a woman to direct a film and it didn’t work. Lets not do that again.” This film is bigger than just being a superhero movie… It has the ability to bust open the glass ceiling of Hollywood to tell them that yes, superhero movies about women do well and yes, women can not only direct blockbusters but they can do it well. Because I can guarantee you, Patty does it well. PLEASE spread this around and let Warner Brothers know we aren’t going to stand for this bullshit. GO SEE WONDER WOMAN JUNE 2nd!!!  This is a called a glass cliff (when men put women in positions of power + set them up to fail). I hope it doesn’t work this time!

Everyone. Even people you don’t know. Theyll ask a lot and think you’re extremely fragile.   bruises show up within the first day of rolling around, and they can really suck  people will try to grab your chair if they think you’re struggling and it can be hard not to snap at them for it  static  electricity is a huge issue. You will probably either continuously shock your leg when you’re rolling around or do what I did today and zap someone so hard as you pass that both of you nearly keel over   people will call you out as a faker if you do anything even remotely fun ever on your wheelchair. Wheelies? Obviously your legs are fine lol not like you have to go down fucking curbs /s   puddles are the worst and if there’s a curb with a puddle all around and you have some ability to walk its a better idea to just stand up and navigate the chair than to fall backwards into said puddle   weird looks from people are inevitable, especially from people who don’t like you   bus drivers will often push your chair and give you advise you don’t want to hear, even if you tell them nicely you can push yourself. Its really hard not to get mad at them for it   no wheelies in school. Though if you do it in the elevator when no one else is with you you can’t really get caught.   speaking of wheelies, always be ready to throw at least one arm behind you in case you fall. They say tuck your chin in but its easier and more reliable to throw your hands back and keep your neck up so you don’t hit the floor. Sore arms are way easier to put up with than head injuries   don’t even bother to try and roll back up curbs. You will either be there for an hour or fall backwards. I managed to do both.  90% of classrooms that aren’t special ed are not very wheelchair accessible.   people will automatically assume you’re faking something if you’re not considered dumb enough in their standards to fit in with disabled students (aka high class ableism at its finest)   people are going to give you weird looks if you don’t suddenly start sitting with the other disabled kids   standard backpacks usually dangle way too much to keep on you easily, so try to pack light   built in storage on wheelchairs cannot sufficiently carry books   don’t try to hold an umbrella. Period. Especially not with your teeth. It doesn’t work.   don’t try to give the bus driver your ticket while you’re stuck on the ramp. And speaking of, its easy to start falling   down the bus ramp so be careful, and when in doubt throw on the breaks  and finally if you’re like me pray to god you don’t go nonverbal when someone is trying to push you and you don’t want them to because it is hard to get them to stop if you can’t speak   able-bodied people can and should 1000% reblog this, some of these things I’ve seen on tips about using a wheelchair but a lot of these weren’t things I’ve seen  " False text

Yondu’s “I’m Mary Poppins y'all!” after Peter says he’s cool. Because yes, it’s a hilarious line, but it’s also such a DAD thing. Like, who can’t say that their dad wouldn’t be so proud to be considered cool by their son and it’s so unexpectedly sweet because of it.  2. The fact that Baby Groot cries like an actual baby once. Because it’s like it’s stabbing you in the heart, but it’s so effective because you really forget that he really is a baby with all the things he can do until then, and that brings you right back. 3. The symmetry in Yondu’s redemption. Yondu is damned because he brings Ego’s children to Ego and his planet to be sacrificed, and he’s redeemed by sacrificing himself to save Ego’s child (who really is HIS child) and bring him away from Ego’s planet. 4. Drax’s interaction with Mantis, especially him holding her while he drowns in Ego’s planet. Because Drax is like this big murderous comic relief character, but his screen time with Mantis was this lovely way to remind the audience that Drax has this soft side and this tragic past without shoving it in your face. Drax might laugh at your pain, but he’d also try to save you even as he was drowning, and it’s a perfect way to frame his character. 5. Ego’s “For the first time, I am truly not ALONE!” and his alieness in general.  Because don’t get me wrong, Ego is absolutely a non redeemable wonky bonkers genocidal jerk off, but he’s got this great alien quality to him that I feel this series really needed. It’s not in how he looks, but his motives and how he acts. Ego is a millennia old being; a god in a world of mortals. His view point of the world and his actions are so very true to that idea that we almost can’t relate because no one can imagine what it must be like to be that old or that powerful.  But when he yells that one line out, we really get it. Ego, for all his power, is just like us; he just doesn’t want to be alone. Coupled with his god like alien superiority, his ego - get it? ;) - he sees the expansion as the way to answer that feeling.  If everything is him, after all, then he can’t be alone, see? What makes him a great villain is that he actually had the real answer all along - love, family - but he chose to destroy it because he felt it was beneath him; because of his subconscious disgust at his own desire to be “just like the rest of them.” 6. Nebula’s “You wanted to win and I just wanted a sister!” And how it turns the tables on how we view her relationship with Gamora. Because Nebula is clearly set up to be the ‘bad sister’ to Gamora’s ‘good sister’ and that one line really throws that on its head and shows that neither one of them are good or bad. I also love how it’s Gamora that ends up apologizing to Nebula, after everything, and Gamora who finally returns Nebula’s offer of sisterhood after all of those years.  7. “You shouldn’t have killed my mom and squished my Walkman!” Like, this line right here; the essence of Peter Quill in 10 worlds. Perfection.  8. The batteries as they relate to the parallel of Yondu’s and Rocket. Because them as a parallel is basically smashed over our heads, but I liked the subtle batteries parallel in that Rocket steals batteries he doesn’t need and Yondu steals Peter, who is used as a battery by Ego. It’s just a little thing but I found it really neat.  9. Rocket’s “I can only afford to lose one friend today,” line and how although it’s clearly framed to be about Peter, it’s also possibly about Yondu. Because no matter what, Rocket is losing a friend and it’s a great line to add to his character development from a guy who started trying to push his friends away to a guy who can’t lose them. 10. The contrast between how Peter reacts to the death of Ego and Yondu. He holds both as they die but he’s just silent and unaffected by Ego and he’s distraught and trying desperately to save Yondu, trying to pull off the suit to give to Yondu and save him instead. Can you say tears? 11. Don’t even talk to me about the Ravager funeral. 12. That the movie really was truly about family. Drax and his family and Mantis, Gamora and Nebula, Rocket and the Guardians, everyone parenting Groot and Peter realizing that the dad he’d wanted all along was actually the one he’d had. Often these superhero movies pull the “we’re family” card and it doesn’t feel earned, but man it does in this one. This movie is like Marvel’s “The Fast and The Furious IN SPACE” and it’s just great.

Whatever Invoices make you uncomfortable or not, you gotta start using them if you want to keep your PayPal and your money. Changes starting this October 19th. Honestly I don’t get why so many artists are so overwhelmed by invoices, takes just a few clicks to set up.  And is not only “oh you have to use invoices because PayPal says so” if you don’t use invoices you’re putting yourself at risk of being scammed by an user abusing the buyer’s protection.  Since PayPal ain’t got no idea of what those $50 you received were for, but the buyer is saying they didn’t got anything for the money, PayPal will just side with the buyer. I’m seriously begging ppl, start using invoices. I’m tired of seeing ppl complain their paypal was banned, or is under investigation, or worse, the $100 they got for a very complicated commission, 3 months later get a refund issue.  just start using invoices for your own sake.  Here is how you use invoices because I can’t keep playing devil’d advocate, yes I would love to help you get your PayPal restored but just this last month I had to help three persons, and they were MORE than aware of this issues.  Just protect yourself.  Step 1. You login and click here Step 2. You click create new Invoice. YOU NEVER CLICK REQUEST MONEY, unless you want to risk yourself to get scamer by buyer’s protection exploit and not only lose your money but your paypal account, and any future paypal linked to your irl name.  Step 3 You follow this steps 1. Invoice for amount only 2. Ask your client for their PayPal email and put in that field 3. Add a vague description of what you’re doing, something like “Character Coloured with Background” is good enough, and if you need more than 1 character you can type in “2″ where it says amount, or just say “2 characters”. Warning: don’t type in “Naruto rawing Sasuke”. That will get you banned.  4. Click send.   Optional steps. Create a template, doesn’t take more than 10 minutes and it will save you a lot of time for future invoices, you can even click on “items” right next to “create invoice” and add a list of services you offer such as “character sketch” “character flats” along with a price, so next time you invoice you just add to the invoice from your list of items and you saved yourself some more time.  More importantly, you protect yourself from buyer’s protection exploit because if PayPal knows you’re doing digital goods, then you will be allowed that you did in fact created a digital good.  Keep PayPal happy, as for right now there are no alternatives to this service, and this is the only source of income for many freelancers.  Stay safe.   Heads up, all commissioning artists  I’ll be doing this from now on!  ADDING THIS BC I HATE PAYPALLLLOK so when you send/make invoices…it doesnt let you choose ‘digital good’ or differentiate between “goods (as in physical)” and “services” (as in doesnt need address) which is what you could do with micropayments….SO WHEN U SEND INVOICE the buyer will be asked for their shipping address. ( I even had the options turned off for shipping?? I was pretty sure there USED TO be an option that you turned off and then it wouldn’t ask for shipping, but that doesnt seem to work anymore? I went to where the setting was and still had the boxes unchecked, and yet my buyer was still getting asked to put in shipping address, and when invoice was paid, i was being asked to provide shipping label by X date or Consequences.)SO APPARENTLY YOU HAVE TO DO THIS as the SELLER SO go to the invoice (i think this can be done BEFORE the buyer pays?? Didnt try myself tho, i did it after it was paid), and click on VIEW DETAILS in that first box  Scroll to the bottom of the page and click ADD TRACKING INFO (YES COUNTER-INTUITIVE AS BALLLLLS.) of course HERE IS WHERE YOU'RE GIVEN INSTRUCTIONS ON PROCESSING DIGITAL GOODS. HIDDEN BEHIND A BUTTON YOU WOULDNT PRESS IF YOU WERE, SAY, TRYING TO SELL DIGITAL GOODS.Select Order Processed/Service Rendered YAY this stuff fills itself out and you can save and not have to worry about shipping your Digital Intangible Product to a very confused seller.I am so salt about this. excuse me while i go cry angrily.   Think I’ll reblog this for my own use… Guess I gotta get used to sending invoices for all transactions soon then " False text

Alien talks about human like s/he’s not there, only to be shocked when its own language comes out of that strange little mouth.  Alien can’t figure out WHAT that noise onboard is, only to find human crewmate pranking it.  (“As soon as he leaves, I’m gonna do the sound of a failing hover engine, okay?  Just see where he looks first!”) Alien hears a different noise and a thud, then “Sorry, I tripped.”  (”But you squeaked.”  “Yeah, didn’t mean to.  Sounded kinda dumb.”) Alien is alarmed to hear the sound of two Dangerous Animals coming from the containment room.  Thinks the one has multiplied.  Runs in, find human yowling back at it.  (“It seemed lonely, so I was talking to it.  Reminds me of a cat I had once.”) The away team is threatened by a Large Animal protecting its young.  Alien Captain knows what to do.  Shoves the human up front and points.  “Make the noises that the little ones are making.  This is your time to shine.”   Okay, but what if it’s first contact or close to. The aliens have been studying our most common languages so they can talk to us and have found none of their sounds. They assume, reasonably, that we physically can’t speak their language. But the first human they meet is just like, “I don’t care if you think I can’t say it, tell me your name.” And eventually they give in. For the next months the human tries over and over again. The first time was recognizable, but not at all accurate to the minute distinctions that humans were in no way equipped to distinguish. Because even learning a new Earth language and parroting back those sounds you’re not used to isn’t easy. But eventually, the human gets it perfectly right and everyone in earshot just stops and stares. “Did I say it right?” “Yes, Human Dan, you got it right.”  “Although, not to belittle your efforts, but our mutual coworker Human Anna got it right after only two tries.”  “Wait, Anna? Anna Kazmierczak? Well, she’s fluent in Polish, and as such is an outlier and shouldn’t be counted.” " False text

Historically, whenever young women are interested in a form of media,  we like to tell them it is bad for them and that they are bad for  liking it — unless the media goes mainstream, in which case it becomes  no longer feminine and hence okay.

Beatlemania is the province of “the dull, the idle, the failures,“ until the Beatles become a band that everyone loves.  Young women are so attacked for loving the media they love that it is  a radical act for a young woman to love something unashamedly.

Under the current version of Steve Rogers’ history, his “core values”  were instilled by Hydra since childhood, leading him to collaborate with  the Nazis and sabotage the Allies’ efforts in World War II; in terms of  Secret Empire itself, he’s plotted and executed a Hydra  takeover of the United States that has left many he pretended to be  friends with for dead, not to mention actively trying to murder others  to further the Hydra cause. Why didn’t his “heart and soul” kick in  during any of these previous events…? Perhaps that is reason enough to keep reading Secret Empire: to  discover what is more morally repugnant to a brainwashed Captain  America than working to ensure a fascist takeover of the world on two separate occasions.

Another huge moment was when Kaine and Todd talked about the omission of the word “Jew” from the Holocaust Remembrance Statement.  Kaine actually went there, calling them “Holocaust deniers”, which was a ‘drop-the-mic’ moment.  Note, Todd didn’t say a word to defend the White House.

It’s even printed on the label as a way of warding off sugar-water price gouging by retailers. The fact that AriZona has been able to resist inflation for nearly a quarter-century is impressive. The fact that the cans usually wind up being cheaper than smaller soft drinks is also impressive, until you begin to realize how strange it is that a vat of iced tea and its accompanying ingredients somehow manages to be less expensive than plain water. In a recent interview with Thrillist, AriZona chief marketing officer and co-owner Spencer Vultaggio shed some light on this convenience store mystery. Unlike water titans Coke (which distributes Dasani), Evian, or Fiji, AriZona has virtually no advertising dollars invested in their teas. “We feel like it’s more important to spend money on something that our customer really cares about, instead of buying billboards or putting our cans in the hands of some celebrity for a few minutes,” Vultaggio said. Even with a frugal approach to ads, AriZona still has to deal with rising production costs. To help resist increasing prices to compensate, the company has pursued alternative manufacturing methods, using 40 percent less aluminum in cans and having enough factories dotting the country to make transportation more efficient. Bottled water, in contrast, is sometimes sourced from abroad, making for exorbitant shipping costs. In the end, it’s not the iced tea that’s more economical than the water; it’s that the container it comes in is simply cheaper to produce and transport. And while AriZona isn’t above charging a premium for fancier drinks—like a tea brewed with oak chips that sells for twice the price—their branding depends heavily on those familiar rows of 99-cent cans and the loyal consumers who keep reaching for them.  Interesting!  I’m glad to know there wasn’t something sinister involved, because I love this stuff and I drink it all the time.  A company that changes its conduct to roll with the times rather than compromise its product is a good company." False link

Many members of the white nationalist group have been outspoken Trump supporters, including the founder of the movement itself, Richard Spencer. Trump has also appointed Steve Bannon as his chief strategist — a man who has been heavily associated with the “alt-right.” The “alt-right” is known for its extremist and racist views, as well as being severely anti-Semitic. It seems like the association between the Trump campaign and neo-Nazis won’t be broken any time soon, as his chosen national security advisor, General Mike Flynn, recently met with Heinz-Christian Strache — the head of Austria’s far-right Freedom Party, which was established by former Nazis after World War II. The Freedom Party was originally created to be a safe haven for Nazis and Nazi sympathizers after World War II and the Holocaust. In the ‘80s, Jörg Haider became its leader, and the party took a turn toward right-wing populism with a strong anti-immigration stance. As the New York Times explains, today, the party is “anti-foreigner, anti-Islam and anti-globalization” making it an appealing party for Europe’s far-right — much like the white nationalist “alt-right” in the U.S. It should be obvious that this meeting between Trump’s National Security Advisor and the leader of a neo-Nazi movement is extremely alarming. This meeting calls back to the words of representatives from the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, who spoke out after the “alt-right” held a chilling conference in Washington D.C. praising Trump. They reminded us, through their statement, that the Holocaust didn’t begin with killing – it began with words.    Well we know which Magazine is getting shutdown on January 21st. Cause Teen Vogue is on fire with how much they hate Trump and it is commendable.

Let  History record my objection to him, to the ways he humiliated women and  vilified Muslims and threatened protestors and disregarded people of  color. Let  it record my repulsion at his tremendous cruelty, his lack of  compassion, his contempt for dissension, his absence of simple decency. Let  witnesses mark down my disgust at the way he boasted of infidelity, at  how he ridiculed a disabled reporter, at the way he attacked female  opponents for their appearance, at the way he marginalized immigrants.

Let the  record show that I looked on with disbelief as he spent countless early  morning and middle-of-the-night hours following the election on social  media, broadcasting a steady stream of petulant, insecure, incoherent  messages instead of preparing to do a job he was ill-equipped for and  seemingly not all that interested in. Let  the record show that I watched him assemble a Cabinet of billionaires  and bigots, of people woefully unqualified to steward our children, our  safety, our healthcare, our financial stability—and that I was horrified  by it all. Let  it be remembered that my faith would not allow me to fall in line  behind this man while so many professed religious people did; that I saw  nothing resembling Jesus in him, and that to declare him Christian would have been to toss aside everything I grew up believing faith in Christ manifested in a life.   Let  History record my grieving at the racism and bigotry and homophobia  that characterized his campaign, marked his supporters, and is evident  in his assembling Administration.

History has been littered with horrible people who did terrible things with power, because too many good people remained silent. And  since my fear is that we are surely entering one of those periods in  our story, I wanted to make sure that I was recorded for posterity: I do not believe this man is normal. I do not believe he is emotionally stable. I do not believe he cares about the full, beautiful diversity of America. I do not believe he respects women. I do not believe he is pro-life other than his own. I do not believe the sick and the poor and the hurting matter to him in the slightest. I do not believe he is a man of faith or integrity or nobility. I do not believe his concern is for anything outside his reflection in the mirror. I believe he is a danger to our children. I believe he is a threat to our safety. I believe he is careless with our people. I believe he is reckless with his power. I believe America will be less secure, less diverse, less compassionate, and less decent under his leadership. And if I prove to be wrong, it will be one of the most joyful errors of my life. I  will own these words and if necessary, willingly and gladly admit my  misjudgment because it will mean that America is a better and stronger  nation, and the world a more peaceful place. But right now I don’t see that happening.  Right  now I am worried for my country, concerned for our planet, scared for  the future of my children, and greatly saddened that 62 million  Americans seem okay with all of this. Let the record show that I was and am not okay with it. Not at all.  Anyone following me, please reblog this. It needs to have a much higher view than this.   Me. " False link

For several years, they lived without visas under the radar of the authorities until they were put on a status known as “provisional release” in 2001. It means they can stay in Japan as long as their asylum application is under review. Asylum seekers are building Japan’s roads and sewersBut it also means they can’t work, they don’t have health insurance and they need permission to travel outside the prefecture where they live. They are also subject to unannounced inspections by immigration officers at their home and they face detention at any time. There are currently some 4,700 people with this status living in Japan. Gursewak, who has never left Japan, has inherited his parents’ provisional release status and all the restrictions that go with it. That fate has exposed him and more than 500 other children who share his predicament to lives of perpetual uncertainty. They can go to government-run schools, where tuition is largely free, but university is out of reach for most because they and their parents aren’t allowed to work and so can’t afford the fees. These children, many of whom are asylum seekers, will soon face a stark choice between forced unemployment and working illegally. “Since I was born I’ve only ever interacted with Japanese people,” said Gursewak, who is now 17, speaks the language with native fluency and considers himself Japanese. “I don’t get why Japan won’t accept me.” While there were almost 14,000 asylum cases under review at the end of 2015, Japan accepted only 27 refugees last year. The year before that, the number was 11.  Friendly reminder that Japanese human rights violations are way under-reported. The country is a fortress, hardly any immigrants or refugees are allowed in, and the few that are are exploited for cheap labor. The criminal justice system is notoriously corrupt, including numerous accusations of prosecutors and police straight up framing clients. The death penalty in Japan is also extra inhumane because inmates on death row are not told the date of their execution and essentially live in fear that every day could be their last.  " False link

The con goes like this: The troll finds a picture of a very Jewish-looking person online—typically a Hasidic Jew in full regalia—and makes it his avatar. He puts a bunch of very Jewish descriptors in his bio (“Orthodox,” “Zionist,” “enemy of the alt-right”). He then proceeds to insert himself into conversations with prominent Twitter users—conversations that will often be read by tens of thousands of followers—and say horrifically racist things. Thus, it appears to unsuspecting readers that Jews are outlandishly bigoted. The same has been done with other minorities, from Latinos to African-Americans to Muslims.   *** The problem is, most casual social media users aren’t even aware that this sort of racist deception is being perpetrated, let alone trained to be vigilant for it. And Twitter isn’t really capable of the detective work to identify these accounts and take them down as they spring up.So the question becomes: How can users fight back? Can this insidious tool of anti-Semitic harassment be defanged like the (((echoes))) that were previously used by internet bigots? The answer is yes, and it takes the form of a Twitter bot.Working with developer Neal Chandra, we created an automated Twitter account that exposes these imposters in real-time. Meet Imposter Buster, social media’s new sheriff. He is programmed with an updated database of impersonator accounts, and every time one of them tweets, he automatically replies and exposes them with pre-programmed evidence:  The bot is kind of amazing. And Rosenberg wants more jobs for it.   So, have you encountered a racist troll impersonating a Jew, African-American, Latino, Muslim, or other minority on Twitter? Send it my way at yrosenberg@tabletmag.com and we’ll put the bot on the case. And do be sure to follow Imposter Buster and his exploits on Twitter!    I <3 Yair.  thius…this is a golem  YES!!! what i love so much about this is everything, but one thing i specifically love is that it fits so precisely into its tradition. the golem of prague was invented to fight a lie – to protect a vulnerable population from the spread of the blood libel.   …in many accounts the creature is brought to life for a specific purpose: to defend the Jews against the pogroms associated with the notorious blood libel. That libel asserted that before every Passover the Jews used the blood of Christian children to bake matzoh. At least in legend the Golem is a counter-myth in which artificial life undermines threats of death: dumb clay leavened with life’s breath denies a slander about life’s blood in unleavened flour.  this bot is 100% a golem.

But many have now opened up about donations the star secretly made to countless good causes while insisting that he remained anonymous. Dame Esther Rantzen said Michael “gave millions” to Childline, of which she is the founder a president, but that he donated the money on the condition of anonymity while he was alive. “For years now he has been the most extraordinarily generous philanthropist, giving money to Childline, but he was determined not to make his generosity public so no-one outside the charity knew how much he gave to the nation’s most vulnerable children,” sad Dame Esther. Richard Osman, who co-hosts Pointless, also opened up saying he had given £15,000 to a contestant on Deal or No Deal who needed the money for IVF. Others included the Terrence Higgins Trust, which said Michael had given “experiences and gifts” to the charity over the years. ““His donations contributed to a vision of a world where people living with HIV live healthy lives free from prejudice and discrimination,” said Jane Barron of THT. “Thanks to George’s legacy, we are a step closer to that world and we are so grateful for his support and friendship over the years.” Other stories included that Michael had given a £25,000 cheque to a woman who he heard crying over debt in a cafe, asking the waitress to hand it over once he had left. Another came from radio DJ Mick Brown, who opened up about an annual £100,000 donation made by Michael to Capital FM’s Christmas charity drive. Journalist Sali Hughes took to Twitter to say she had written a story about a celebrity who had given £5,000 to a barmaid who was a student nurse in debt, revealing that it was Michael. Many more stories including offering a free concert to NHS nurses who cared for his late mother, and volunteering at a homeless shelter, poured out as thousands mourned the death of the Wham! star. This is in addition to his performances on charity singles like ‘Do They Know It’s Christmas?’, donating royalties from his Elton John duet ‘Don’t Let the Sun Go Down On Me’ to an AIDS hospice, and much other public charity work.

This came after public outcry across social media networks including Facebook and Twitter, along with numerous petitions posted on Change.org. It’s important to remember that this reflects a change in language, but not necessarily a change in circumstance. Many Rockettes will be coerced into “volunteering” for this show because they risk losing their job and being blacklisted if they don’t agree.   Ms. Lang, 35, said that for full-time and seasonal dancers, there is a fear of jeopardizing their future employment and of compromising their standing in the eyes of James L. Dolan, the executive chairman of the Madison Square Garden Company, and his executives, if they complain or try to bow out. “One of the most annoying situations about that job is it’s corporate,” Ms. Lang said. “It’s not like a Broadway show where you feel like you have an artistic voice. You’re sort of owned by this corporation.” So even if an appearance is considered voluntary, individual Rockettes may feel forced to perform if they are told that executives want them onstage in Washington. […] Many of the women have feared standing up for themselves in the current controversy, she said. “Everybody’s in fear of losing their job.”  Emphasis mine. As far as I can tell at this moment, their union has not released any additional updates suggesting they will fight to protect the employment of dancers who refuse. This is a complete failure on the part of their union, especially in light of the fact that the union itself previously said that dancers would have to perform. This means that for many of these women whose livelihood is at stake, there is not actually a choice. But there is an illusion of choice that keeps the company itself from looking responsible in the public eye. It’s a PR move. " False link
