My answer to that is always the same and I thought you guys might wanna read it.I think the most important thing if you want to start to code is to get a basic understanding of how code works and the most accessible option to learn this is on codecademy. It is free and while the courses aren’t that long, they give you everything you need.After that the rest is mainly practice, googling stuff and trying stuff out yourself. What they told me in Programming 101 is that “the only way to learn a programming language is to write programs in it” and after almost 10 years of coding myself, I can still confirm this.So for all of you out there, take the name of this blog literally and never stop coding!Cheers" True text
