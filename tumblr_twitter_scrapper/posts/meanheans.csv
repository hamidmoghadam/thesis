Broadway is an incredibly hard thing to have access to when you’re a teenager or young adult and don’t live close enough to New York because overall, it costs a lot of money. There needs to be perspective from both sides and each side needs to give a little to take a little. Stop making theatre closed off for those who can’t afford to see it. Don’t just complain about a problem, realize that there IS a solution to it and fix it because at the end of the day, people are still going to want to see shows from Broadway and /will/ find a way to see them, illegally or not.  No but seriously. This all goes hand-in-hand with the whole “NO ONE CARES ABOUT BROADWAY ANYMORE~~~ /SADFACE” BS spewed by Broadway industry/NYC tourism board people. Like, they’ve got this narrative in their head that people just suddenly lost all interest in theater one day and are trying to paint themselves as the victims of an uncaring public completely oblivious to the fact that attendance went down around the same time that ticket prices started inflating into the hundreds for seemingly no other reason than “they felt like it.” Back in the ‘90s you could get orchestra seating tickets for a popular new Tony Award winning show for somewhere between $80-$100. Now?  Theaters are charging the same amount for seats in the nosebleed section with an obstructed view.  It’s ridiculous.  Orchestra seat tickets these days are going for as high as $500.  That’s a 400% increase over the course of twenty fucking years. Imagine spending ~$1000 on a night out with your partner and that doesn’t even cover the cost of dinner. Outside of lotteries – which not every theater does, aren’t highly advertised, are not easily accessible to people who work/are visiting –  it’s literally impossible to buy a pair of tickets without ending up spending somewhere between $200-$400 unless you’re seeing a show that’s been running for over ten years. People can’t afford to go to Broadway anymore.   Or if they do, they have to save up or wait for a sudden influx of money and then choose one show that they really want to see that year and hope anything else will still be open by the time they get the money to see that. You cannot continue to price more and more people out of Broadway theaters and then 1) complain that no one’s coming anymore so they must not care, and 2) complain that people are finding other ways to try to experience these unnecessarily exclusive shows. The film industry was partially founded on the idea of making theater more accessible to people who couldn’t patronize Broadway.  When did the theater industry decide that film was its enemy?  No wait, I’m not done. People want to see the shows. That’s why bootlegs exist!  Not because people are selfish, but because they can’t afford the only means of actually seeing them. You really think that people who pay for bootlegs wouldn’t happily pay for a legitimate professional recording? Why do you think Andrew Lloyd Webber is slowly working his way through his entire catalogue and putting out DVD’s?  Of even the FAILED projects!  And people are watching them!  They’re watching them so enthusiastically that he’s in the process of reviving at least one of those epic failures! For fuck’s sake even the Metropolitan Opera has a partnership with one movie theater chain to livestream their productions because they understand this very basic concept that people will pay to experience something they really want to but not if they can’t afford it.  Also, What does it say that every time a musical is filmed and released, it always has big named stars attached to it, it’s always labeled with ‘movie of the year’ and always tops the box office for the weekend it’s released?  The fact that Phantom of the Opera with gerard butler earned back more than twice it’s budget despite heavy criticism. Hairspray from 2007 earned almost 3 times. Mama Mia earned back 12 times its budget.  Because i can afford ten dollars to see a movie, i might even be inclined to see a movie twice or three times in theatres, and still buy it on DVD for 25$ when it comes out. which, all in all is less than 60$.  Clearly the point ins’t that musicals aren’t popular, despite what pop culture would like to tell you about theatre kids.  Musicals are always popular, and movie musicals almost always do well financially, and id bet money its because it’s a lot easier to take a chance on seeing a new movie for less than the cost of a dinner than to see a broadway show for the cost of a mortgage payment. I can think of three live shows filmed, off the top of my head (Rent, Shrek and Cats) and they’re all very well done, (i mean, cats as a show is kind of generic) I own a copy of all three, and to be honest I’d rather have copies of these shows as filmed on stage then the ones i have that are actual movies. Stage performance is an entirely different medium than film performance and you can’t really encourage people to embrace a new art form if youc ant expose them to it.  Might I also add that there are also people interested in Broadway productions, but they don’t live in the US or Britain, so they don’t get to see it, because half of the productions don’t get translated and performed here. And if they do, some of them don’t have the quality of the original performence. So it’s not just about the tickets. I might have enough money to actually buy a ticket to Broadway, but not a ticket to London or New York! " False text

The more I read ‘original’ romance fiction, the more I realize that I’ve been terribly, horribly, brutally spoiled by fanfiction. Why is that? How does it happen? How do these things get published…      Just to add - there was a time when I obsessively devoured commercial romance fiction.  For years.  And then I discovered fanfiction, and I haven’t bought a commercial romance novel since.  Every now and then, I get a bit of nostalgia for my very favorite commercial romance novels - the best of the best, honestly - and I’ll reread them.  And today, I find them virtually unreadable, because fanfic quality is so much higher.  I would love it if you would expound (here or on DW/LJ) about the ways in which fanfic does what commercial romance does, only better. I can’t do it because I never was a fan of commercial romance.    Well, totally off the top of my head: 1.  Quality of writing - this isn’t just true of commercial romances, I’ve seen it a lot in popular general fiction.  Decent fanfic has more sophisticated writing.  I mean, decent to great fanfic writes on a higher reading level than most popular fiction.  The sentence structure, the vocabulary - it’s more sophisticated.  I really can’t overstate this:  Fanfic - if it’s decent to great - is more sophisticated in terms of writing technique than popular romance, and much (in my experience) general popular fiction.   2.  Gender - I stopped reading romance novels maybe 10-15 years ago, so I can’t comment on the most recent ones. As of the time I stopped reading, though, sexist gender roles were still quite rampant.  Certainly it had improved - seriously, if no one’s done it yet, there’s so much to be mined just comparing the gender roles in romance fiction from the 70s as compared to the 2000s - but still, even with the most “modern” heroines, it was still expected that the hero would be stronger, more aggressive, more protective in a way that really grates when I compare to fanfic. 3.  Woobies and reader identification - Fanfic is filled with “woobie” characters - the abused character who is clearly supposed to be the reader-identifier.  The partner then swoops in as a savior, who expresses the appropriate level of sympathy for the woobie’s plight.  In profic, for a heterosexual romance marketed at women, the woman was meant to be the reader-identified character - but the man was the woobie.  Not in any way fanfic writers would identify, but very often (not always, but often) the man would be the one who had suffered trauma and the woman would be in the role of healer.  She often had trauma of her own - Cinderella style, maybe she was poor and unpopular - but still, she was cast as the only one who could heal the man’s wounds.  This is fundamentally different from fanfic.  Though I don’t want to overstate - especially in the more modern romances, someone got a clue and started giving more of a tragic backstory to the woman. 4.  More complex stories/characterization.  To be fair, fanfic has a leg up - it has all that canon to draw on.  Still, for the best fanfic, this was routinely the case, even for AUs, that drew minimally from canon. 5.  Point of view - the earliest romances  (again, has anyone written a thesis on this?) are entirely from the woman’s point of view.  The man is a domineering mystery, and all of his seemingly-abusive actions are revealed to come from love/jealousy at the very end.  Only in more recent romances has the male POV - and in particular, his love for the heroine - been revealed as the story goes.  Fanfic is much more free in terms of who’s POV is displayed, including the ongoing affection of the non-reader-identifier. 6.  Competence.  In the best fics, the main characters are both very competent - and the reader-identifier often has many occasions to demonstrate his/her competence to the partner.  In romances, the woman character was rarely (when I was reading) allowed to be that competent.  Sometimes she had a particular sphere of expertise that kicked off the story - the hero needed someone to identify a forged painting, for example - but other than the specific task assigned, her competence didn’t usually advance the plot. (Most of the romances that I can remember where she had more of a role were historical romances - so she could be put back in her place in other aspects of the narrative).  In fic, by contrast, the reader-identified character will discover and cast the critical spell, or write the crucial computer program, evade the security system, or otherwise display a competence that particularly is important to the plot, as well as saving the partner.  Often while surviving torture.  Anyhoo, that’s off the top of my head.  I’m sure there’s more…  When I first discovered fanfic and how damn good it was (and it’s better now than it was then), and that it was by women for women, I naively thought that given enough time the mainstream would recognise it as a serious literary movement and value it.  Then I lost some of my naivete and learned more about intersectional feminism, and realised that as with so many things, the entrenched kiriarchy benefits in denigrating particular works by particular communities: Young Adult literature (unless by exceptional men), Romance (unless by exceptional men), fan works (unless by exceptional men). It even explains the scorn of the genres, like SF, in the Literary Reputation Stakes – the more useful and popular a genre of literature has the potential to be for the common reader, the less respectable it is. SF/F/H all really kicked off in the pulps, which was the internet of its day.  Basically, literary reputation is all about elevating the rarified (male) Educated Man. Fanfiction will never achieve respectability with them as long as our current power structures are in place, and neither will any of those other genres. But the big take away for me is that I no longer care. To get that kind of respectability, I’d have to endorse that power structure, and as an intersectional feminist, I don’t. I’ve also come to realise that fan fiction doesn’t stand alone. Fan works all go together as a metatext and inform each other, and the debates they have and the tropes they explore are not clear if you don’t know that wider history. And that is another thing the mainstream would resist, and not want to acknowledge, if it ever came to it. The mainstream is still wed to the idea of individual genius that is not influenced and educated by contemporaries, but rather inspired. What I do think we could potentially do more of ourselves is to honour our stars, without waiting for external endorsement. It’s not a big part of fan culture to do that kind of thing, as we individually still bring a lot of baggage with us when we find fandom, related to our experiences of exclusion. That plays out in a lot of ways, but one of them is we’re not great at formalising our informal methods of showing appreciation. It’s one of the things that makes discovering our history difficult, because it tends to exist in individual rec lists rather than a… I hate the notion of a “canon” actually, but the thing is we do have one already, in a loose consensus kind of way. I think it would be awesome if we could formalise that sense of consensus, as opposed to having a panel of Learned Mainstream Experts labeling our works canon. They will get it wrong! Because if the mainstream ever did deign to recognise fan fiction as a worthy new branch of literature, they’d isolate works and turn them into the Inspirational Story of the Writer Who Made Good, or else take the museum approach of the Interesting Native Artifact. That’s the first thing that would happen. And I’d much rather we’d already invented our own ways to honour our stars, and the works that have helped form us, and their influence on our shared history, and the networked patterns of our culture.  We’ve made a good start with things like Fanlore and the AO3, but we don’t have easy-to-access reading/watching lists for beginners – that’s what awards lists are for pro writers, along with things like library lists of “If you liked X, then try…”. I think we could do something like that, but better. Put it in place and establish it so well that when the mainstream finally wakes up (and it will be soon, because they see dollars now, when they look at us), it’s already so well established that they just go along with it. I would really like to see us have that control over our own stuff. The mainstream don’t deserve to name us and rate us, and they can’t be trusted to. " False link

I’m a real lawyer and here’s some free advice if you’re going to any of the various protests, marches, etc. this week. - Do not engage in illegal activity, even if it is harmless or unrelated to the event.  Don’t smoke pot, don’t obstruct traffic, don’t kick a sign post.  DO NOT GIVE THE POLICE A REASON TO ARREST YOU. Comply with all lawful orders made by police.  If you do any of this, be prepared to be arrested.  Civil disobedience, while admirable, sometimes requires sacrifice; you will be charged even if your cause is righteous.  - It will be cold.  Dress in layers.  Wear comfortable clothing that you won’t mind wearing for a very long time.  Wear shoes that don’t have laces, if possible.  Wear clothing that does not require a belt.  If you are arrested, your laces and belts will likely be confiscated. - Google the phone number for the National Lawyers Guild and write it in Sharpie on one or both of your forearms.  If you are arrested, you will want to call them. - Disable the fingerprint ID on your phone and enable the passcode function.  Police can force you to place your fingerprint on your phone but they cannot force you to enter in the passcode.  Refuse all requests/demands to open your phone unless you are presented with a warrant.  - Bring a valid government issued photo ID that has your name., address, and  date of birth on it.  This will make things go more smoothly for you - You are not required to answer any questions from police unless you are being detained.  If an officer asks you a question, ask him/her if you are being detained.  If you are being detained you have the right to know why you’re being detained. If he/she says no, walk away. - Police are not required to read you your Miranda rights when you are arrested.  This is a persistent myth.  Police must inform you of your Miranda rights if they are interrogating you.  Interrogation does not include asking you your name, address, date of birth, etc.   You must answer these questions. Anything after answering basic identification questions, you have the right to have an attorney present. - Police will not just give you an attorney.  You have to ask for one.  In some states, asking the first time requires the police to stop interrogation.  In other states, you may have to ask more than once.  They may try to goad you into answering questions after you ask for an attorney.  Once you request an attorney, do not answer any more questions no matter what.  Do not answer any questions past basic ID questions until you have an attorney present.  Please feel free to share.” " False link

Even as the Wisconsin recount enters its third day and numerous inconsistencies are being documented, the mainstream media has remained silent. After the Michigan elections board approved the recount go-ahead, nary a peep. Now the major media outlets are finally talking about the Pennsylvania recount effort, but only to report that it’s now “over” – which is not the case. What actually happened today is that in a desperate last ditch attempt at preventing the recount, the State of Pennsylvania suddenly invented a million dollar bond that third party candidate Jill Stein would have needed to immediately pay for. This came after the state of Wisconsin had surreptitiously increased its own recount price tag from $1.1 million to $3.8 million, for the rather transparent purpose of trying to bankrupt Stein’s recount effort. Stein had raised millions of dollars, but with so much of that having been eaten up already by Wisconsin’s sudden price hike and the attorney fees required to fight fierce court battles against all three non-cooperating states, it turns out she didn’t have the $1 million cash on hand today to cover Pennsylvania’s sudden ransom demand. Thus she was forced to withdraw her court petition for a Pennsylvania recount. That doesn’t mean it’s over, of course, only that there is now another legal hurdle to fight. In fact her next step is to fight for precinct by precinct recounts in Pennsylvania until the vote totals have been sufficiently corrected and revised to drop Donald Trump’s lead in the state from the current 0.8% mark to the 0.5% mark, which in turn would trigger an automatic statewide recount under Pennsylvania state law. So how many mainstream major media outlets are correctly reporting that the PA recount effort is now continuing with a new strategy? There don’t appear to be any.   If you look at the headlines coming from the major media outlets this evening, they’re uniformly misleading in that they’re attempting to create the appearance that Stein’s recount effort is finished. “Green Party drops court case seeking statewide recount of Pennsylvania’s Nov. 8 presidential election,” states the Associated Press in a tweet which paint the phony picture that there are no next steps. BuzzFeed News falsely claims that Stein put in a “request to discontinue the recount request,” misleadingly suggesting that she pulled the plug on her own effort. And this ABC News affiliate flatly insisted in its original headline that the challenge to the recount is “over” before ultimately changing the headline entirely to focus on Stein’s next move.     It would be one thing for the major media outlets to ignore the recount effort because they simply decided it wasn’t newsworthy. But after spending the past week largely pretending the recount effort wasn’t happening, these same major media outlets are now racing to report headlines which falsely claim the Pennsylvania recount effort is over. In other words, they didn’t want the public to know about that the recounts were even happening, but now they suddenly want to make the public believe that the recounts are “over.” The mainstream media agenda here isn’t entirely decipherable, but it is entirely unacceptable.    Good news!  Please, if you live in Pennsylvania, go to the Recount website and volunteer as an observer in your precinct.  http://www.jill2016.com/recountPA Overseeing the Recount to make sure that even more fraudulent crap isn’t happening is absolutely critical.

We decided to go through line by line and debunk post. You can view the original article here. “Ever since the Presidential Election results came in, there’s been post after post of people spreading around the phone number for a supposed suicide hotline for trans people, called Trans Lifeline. What people don’t know is that this “hotline” is a huge scam meant to fund the founder’s’ personal lives,…” Nina Chaubal and Greta Martela are two trans women who were software engineers in San Francisco. When Greta was suicidal, she experienced ignorance, mistreatment, and abuse while trying to get the help she needed. They decided they needed to do something to help other suicidal trans folks, so they left their jobs where they made a combined income of $260,000 in order to found the Trans Lifeline. In 2015, the both dedicated themselves full time to the Trans Lifeline. Greta collected a salary of $28,800 that year, and Nina worked without pay for the first fifteen months of Trans Lifeline, living entirely off of her savings. In 2016, they are each collecting a salary of $30,000 (since they work 70 hours per week on average, that is practically minimum wage) for a combined income of $60,000. “…and that the hotline barely answers their calls, if ever.” Since Trans Lifeline launched in November of 2014, we’ve answered 17,064 calls. “A twitter was made a while back to cover the small, almost nonexistent amount of operators on the line, but it is now inoperable because the founders found out and shut down the source of the twitter bot’s information, because how dare someone provide the truth.” Kiwifarms is a website dedicated to harassing autistic trans women into dying by suicide. Kiwifarms launched a personal attacks on staff of Trans Lifeline including Greta, Nina, and an intern. This attack included leaving explicit harassing messages, death threats, and attempting to disclose their personal addresses online. Frustrated that their attacks did not dissuade us from offering life-saving support to trans people who were suicidal, Kiwifarms supporters created a twitter bot to defame Trans Lifeline and spread lies.

But he  didn’t come out of nowhere.”  Obama aimed most of his criticisms  past the GOP nominee and at Republicans who allowed conspiracy theories  and the anger of the party’s base to grow to the point that Trump was  able to commandeer it. That includes those who un-endorsed Trump, as  Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) did on Saturday, after a 2005 video revealed  Trump bragging about using his fame to assault women.  “They don’t get credit for, at the  very last minute, when finally the guy that they nominated and they  endorsed and they supported is caught on tape saying things that no  decent person would even think, much less say, much less brag about,  much less laugh about or joke about, much less act on,” Obama said at  the dinner. “You can’t wait until that finally  happens and then say, ‘Oh, that’s too much, that’s enough,’ and think  that somehow you are showing any kind of leadership and deserve to be  elected to the United States Senate,” he continued. “You don’t get  points for that. In fact, I’m more forgiving of the people who actually  believe it than the people who know better and stood silently by out of  political expediency.”  Portman announced  that he will no longer support Trump for the presidency and will vote  for the Republican vice presidential nominee, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence,  instead. The senator is seeking re-election against former Democratic  Gov. Ted Strickland, whom Obama praised at the event. Portman leads  Strickland in polls by 13 percentage points, according to a HuffPost Pollster average of surveys. Other Republicans also un-endorsed Trump after his 2005 remarks were uncovered, although some have since switched back and said they would vote for Trump.  House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) still endorses Trump, but said he would no longer defend him, while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has avoided speaking on the matter. In the days since the video was published, multiple women have alleged they were sexually assaulted by Trump, which he has denied.  Obama questioned the Republican message: “You claim the mantle of the party of family values and this is the guy you nominate?” He accused Republicans of laying the  groundwork for Trump by “feeding their base all kinds of crazy for  years, primarily for political expedience.”  One example was Trump’s long-running  lie that Obama wasn’t born in the U.S. ― an attack on the first black  president that most Republicans declined to condemn. Trump took until last month ― well after the GOP nominated him ― to acknowledge he believes Obama was born in the U.S. “If Trump was running around saying I  wasn’t born here, they were okay with that as long as it helped them  with votes,” Obama said. “If some of these folks on talk radio started  talking about how I was the antichrist, ‘Well, you know, it’s just  politics.’ You think I’m joking.”  Obama also criticized Texas  Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Greg Abbott for fueling a conspiracy  theory that the president was attempting to launch martial law in Texas,  pretending they didn’t know about a military training exercise.  “What do you mean, you don’t know?  What does that mean? Really? You think that like, the entire Pentagon  said, ‘Oh, really, you know, you want to declare martial law and take  over Texas? Let’s do it under the guise of routine training missions,’”  Obama said. “They took it seriously. This is in the swamp of crazy that  has been fed over and over and over again.” Obama said that’s why the Republican Party is where it is today.  “They stood by while this happened,” he said. “And Donald Trump, as he’s prone to do, he didn’t build the building himself, but he just slapped his name on it and took credit for it.” " True link

Indigenous culture honors American bison (known as Tatanka Oyate, or Buffalo Nation) as a symbol of sacrifice, as the bison give their lives to provide food, shelter, and clothing through the use of their meat and their hides. Native Americans maintain a spiritual tradition with bison, believing that as long as buffalo — a gift from the Great Spirit — roam free and as long as the herds are bountiful, the sovereignty of indigenous people would remain strong.   And in the midst of mass arrests, mace attacks, and beatings from batons, a stampede of bison suddenly appeared near the Standing Rock protest camp. A cry of joy reportedly erupted from the Standing Rock Sioux, as they had been praying for assistance from the Tatanka Oyate during their standoff with riot police and national guardsmen.   As the police response to the Sioux’s ongoing nonviolent civil disobedience escalates, tribal leaders are calling on state and federal governments to respect the constitutional rights of water protectors and stop the mistreatment of the indigenous community. “We call on the state of North Dakota to oversee the actions of local law enforcement to, first and foremost, ensure everyone’s safety.

One question for the panel was something to the effect of, “Should parents read their daughter’s texts or monitor her online activity for bad language and inappropriate content?” I was surprised when the first panelist answered the question as if it were about cyberbullying. The adult audience nodded sagely as she spoke about the importance of protecting children online. I reached for the microphone next. I said, “As far as reading your child’s texts or logging into their social media profiles, I would say 99.9% of the time, do not do that.” Looks of total shock answered me. I actually saw heads jerk back in surprise. Even some of my fellow panelists blinked. Everyone stared as I explained that going behind a child’s back in such a way severs the bond of trust with the parent. When I said, “This is the most effective way to ensure that your child never tells you anything,” it was like I’d delivered a revelation. It’s easy to talk about the disconnect between the old and the young, but I don’t think I’d ever been so slapped in the face by the reality of it. It was clear that for most of the parents I spoke to, the idea of such actions as a violation had never occurred to them at all. It alarms me how quickly adults forget that children are people.Apparently people are rediscovering this post somehow and I think that’s pretty cool! Having experienced similar violations of trust in my youth, this is an important issue to me, so I want to add my personal story: Around age 13, I tried to express to my mother that I thought I might have clinical depression, and she snapped at me “not to joke about things like that.” I stopped telling my mother when I felt depressed. Around age 15, I caught my mother reading my diary. She confessed that any time she saw me write in my diary, she would sneak into my room and read it, because I only wrote when I was upset. I stopped keeping a diary. Around age 18, I had an emotional breakdown while on vacation because I didn’t want to go to college. I ended up seeing a therapist for - surprise surprise - depression. Around age 21, I spoke on this panel with my mother in the audience, and afterwards I mentioned the diary incident to her with respect to this particular Q&A. Her eyes welled up, and she said, “You know I read those because I was worried you were depressed and going to hurt yourself, right?” TL;DR: When you invade your child’s privacy, you communicate three things: You do not respect their rights as an individual. You do not trust them to navigate problems or seek help on their own. You probably haven’t been listening to them. Information about almost every issue that you think you have to snoop for can probably be obtained by communicating with and listening to your child." False link
