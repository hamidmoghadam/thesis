I am just putting my two cents in on the subject of Grell’s gender because I have seen a lot of hate about that going around lately with people blatantly disrespecting each other over it. First off, yes, Grell uses feminine pronouns in some pages of the manga but some people completely ignore the pages in which Grell is referred to - by Yana herself - with a mix of male pronouns and female titles. On Yana Toboso’s blog, she consistently uses male pronouns when referencing Grell. Both she (and Grell) use the word okama, which is usually used for effeminate gay men and/or cross-dressers, and kare, meaning “he”, to describe Grell. In the Ciel in Wonderland OVA, Grell does also mention being “caught in an existence that doesn’t know if it is male or female,” suggesting gender is actually not a clear cut thing for Grell.  In addition, there are cultural factors to consider.   Let’s be sadly honest, Japan is not really up on appropriate, non-stereotypical LGBT/Gender portrayals. In Japan, it is common for the media to lump the gay and transgender communities together, perpetuating stereotypes and misconceptions about both. Gay entertainers often present themselves as overly feminine and flamboyant in their mannerisms and many people believe that these men want to become women. This is not always the case however and many do it to cater to their audiences.  Yana is not exempt from the possibility of casually confusing her own ideas on Grell’s gender but it is also equally possible that we, as individuals coming from a more open culture, are misinterpreting a character who is an over-the-top caricature influenced by her sheltered experiences and those of her main, Japanese audiences. With Yana Toboso’s mixed uses of pronouns, we will not know with absolute certainty what Grell’s gender is until Yana (or her through Grell) comes out and announces it clearly. Now, this does not mean you cannot use female pronouns for Grell and, in fact, many fans do. There is nothing wrong with this at all and it is all based on your preference and the connection you feel with the character. There is also nothing wrong with using the male pronouns Yana herself uses. So if you see someone refer to Grell as “he”, please do not shame, name call, or hate. The same goes for when you see others using “she”. That tears the fandom apart the same way anti-shippers do. As one final point, using male pronouns for Grell does not limit the character to being male. It is entirely possible that Grell could be gender fluid, switching between male and female while still maintaining his attraction to men such as Sebastian and William based on how Grell is feeling at the time. So please, refer to Grell as she/her if you want OR he/him if you prefer. Hell, refer to Grell as BOTH to accommodate the canon switches. But please, DO NOT hate/harass someone for seeing it differently than you. Everybody loves Grell regardless and just wants their happiness! <3 " False text

But what about the evidence AGAINST the 2CT? 1. It doesn’t fit in which Madame Red or Elizabeth’s Memories  Ciel doesn’t appear in either Madame Red or Elizabeth’s memories. You would think a mention of another Ciel, that died would be appear in Madame Reds memories, when she mentions the people she loves, thinking back over her happiest times, and well as the mention of the twin’s instead of just Ciel’s birthday, and a mention of the nephews (plural) that died in a fire. 	At the very least Elizabeth would have mentioned it in her private memories, in which she spills all her raw emotions, and the reasons for her actions of which she never told anyone. 	Elizabeth would have known about, and have been upset that one of her cousin’s died, and would have wondered and mentioned how this death affected her fiancé.  1.	Why doesn’t the twin appear in any photos?(the following is a snippet from darkspellmaster’s blog) http://darkspellmaster.tumblr.com/post/158771227510/so-is-there-a-connection-between-the-image-between  The most significant pieces of evidence for the 2CT come from images of Ciel seeming to be stabbed and alive at the cult sacrifice scene.  However, other theories, noticeably the Worthy Ciel theory can explain this: Ciel was resurrected by the Grim Reapers having been judged Worthy of having an impact on humanity (which he certainly does, stopping bad stuff from happening being a very effective Queens watchdog). (more on this –> https://missaliceofadlington.tumblr.com/post/160550217113/the-worthy-ciel-theory ) Another piece of ‘evidence’ is the scene in which Ciel dreams in the Green Witch arc. This is also a cinch to provide an alternate reason for: The second Ciel represents Ciel’s subconscious, the Ciel that he was before he died, and formed a contract with a demon, causing him to reject those around him knowing that he was going to die, and was meant to die, and as he genuinely cares for them and doesn’t want to see them suffer, he acts as unlovable as possible. The second Ciel is purely metaphorical – the representation of his previous, innocent character that was sacrificed, and taken out of him by his experiences with the cult, and having to grow up and resume large amounts of responsibility at a young age. He sacrificed who he was to become a demon of sorts.       Ok evidence part over, personal rant time:   But even ignoring the evidence one big question you have to ask is: What value is added by having an extra family member die in this incident? According to the 2CT he was sacrificed, and this doesn’t really add anything to the plot, or development of Ciel’s character. After all, the goal of his revenge is explicitly stated to be FOR HIMSELF, it doesn’t matter, there are things you cannot bring back. He applies this logic to the deaths of all his family, including Madame Red. Things would still be the same, he would still think the same if an extra person died in the incident, ESPECIALLY if, as according to many 2C theorists, the twin was very sickly, so he was expecting his death anyways. The second gripe I have with the 2CT is it’s It’s universal acceptance I’m tired of seeing only THIS as an example of the potential plot twists. No one has the creative energy to think of any other possible reason. Literally anything could be on those pieces of paper. Perhaps the Undertaker is included in the family photo, proving Ciel’s unique bloodline. But no one is willing to see or discuss any other alternative when the 2CT is “pretty much canon”. Who burn the photo anyway? In the spoilers, Ciel looks shocked to see it, so he didn’t do it. At any rate, given the wide scope, and the many scientific advancements, characters, and supernatural beings/ and elements in the show you would think there would be a variety of different ideas out there, but it seems the fandom is made out of 0.1% thinkers, 99.9% sheep. As of chapter 127 I certaintly wouldn’t say the evidence we’ve been given is enough to confirm the 2CT (or any Black Butler theory I’ve heard of) But the majority of black butler speculators seemed to have taken it as God’s (or Toboso’s) word the second they’ve heard of it.  However I will admit the 2CT isn’t impossible. But Yana Toboso better come up with a good explanation as to why Madame Red and Elizabeth don’t remember or mention shit. Though I suppose the kuroverse, with it’s still largely undefined supernatural elements (does anyone truly know the limits of demons and grim reapers in the kuroverse) wouldn’t actually have a hard time coming up with something to fill it. The Undertaker has messed around with cinematic records (though I wouldn’t think he was on the level at that point in time to erased specific people from memories [and photos]). If the 2CT is true I would say Sebastian is the most likely culprit for messing with the memories, as he seems to have control of his cinematic record when Grell stabbed him, and we have no confirmation that he can’t do it yet.   @queenofsebaciel" False text

The final twist is something really lighthearted. Like it turns out the whole thing has been them playing a fantasy game, sort of d&d style, and making up the story with their characters in Ciel’s living room on a rainy day. When characters die it’s because they had to go home. Lau’s been missing because he’s in the kitchen getting snacks. The plot sometimes seems like it isn’t going anywhere because they’re just making it up as they go along. The lighter arcs are when soma and Lizzy are in charge, the darker ones are mainly due to Ciel being a massive edgelord. Vincent is annoyed that they killed him off right away because Ciel didn’t want to play with his dad, so he keeps popping in to have flashback moments, dragging his friend deidrich with him. Sebastian isn’t even a demon, he’s just Ciel’s older brother that Ciel insisted on being a demon and doing everything he asks. And at the end there’s flashback scenes to them playing out major scenes from throughout the story. Oh my gosh this is so cute haha!! And Grell just shows up uninvited now and then but she gets way too in to it, trying to battle all the time until someone is forced to give her a time out.
