No forewarning in the casting call, just a dozen of the best aspiring designers chosen and when they meet the models, they happen to be size 12 and above. Of course they’ll cry at first, but Tim Gunn will tell them to get over it and maybe we’ll have some amazing original designs for people the industry usually ignores.  With Christian Siriano as the first guest judge giving everyone single designer who complains the what for  Please let this happen, I only have two dollars, but they are yours if I can have this  ashley nell tipton as the second guest judge who utterly destroys them  if they do this, then they must increase the budget for each designer because larger sized models means more fabric needed means the designers need larger budgets. that’s why the show will never go for it.  @electracopes    Yeah… no.    1. This is a sponsored television program where designers routinely buy/waste more fabric than they’ll ever need on challenges and it’s all on the show’s dime. And it’s all for the art and show of it.  They’ll never even be worn again. Cost is a ridiculous reason to reject creating plus size season… money is irrelevant here.    2. Also, not every type and print is fabric costs the same.  Some are cheaper than others.  If designers can deal with restrictive budgets on the regular PR challenges in order to create something unique and beautiful there’s absolutely no reason why they couldn’t take the same budget and make adjustments to do the same thing for plus size women.   3. At the industry level, the idea that plus size clothes cost SO MUCH MORE than straight sizes has been debunked time and again. It simply doesn’t… especially at the quantities at which they are purchasing fabric for mass production.    4. Costs can also be brought down by cutting patterns out of fabrics in a conscientious way to reduce waste (which designers on PR already do when working with expensive fabrics or limited budgets).   5. The costs of men’s clothes do not vary as drastically as women’s do regardless of their size.  If the fabric cost excuse were genuine, you would expect the same exorbitant price hike reflected there. Big and tall clothes for men are generally within a reasonable range of the lower sizes.      6. Plus size women’s clothes cost more and designers refuse to create plus size clothes not because of cost or any other reasonable difficulties, but because it’s a punitive measure against fat women and because they thus far been able to get away with it.

If you come across someone who has heard of the commercial, they might understand. If you come across someone who’s never heard of it, they might think it’s a prank call and hang up on you. A piece of actual advice to help you in this situation is to dial 911, then hang up without speaking, then turn the phone off. 911 will attempt to call you back, and when they’re unable to reach you, they’ll dispatch a unit to your location under the assumption that you need help and your call was interrupted. This will work 100% of the time, whereas the pizza trick will only work if the dispatcher has heard of the commercial/urban legend. Also, the toppings thing was a complete and total fabrication and whoever wrote that should be ashamed of themselves, tbh.  If you’re on a cell phone, the dispatcher DOES NOT KNOW WHERE YOU ARE. You do need to find an excuse to give them your address, and ordering food is the best excuse. A 911 dispatcher will not just hang up if they think you might be prank calling them, they’ll ask you if there’s an emergency and you can say “yes,” and say your address and whatever else you need to say to keep your cover (like a pizza order). This doesn’t rely on any code, it relies on the fact that 911 dispatchers are trained to send a unit no matter what—as long as they know where to send it.  This is actually a huge problem with 911 dispatchers, they DO NOT KNOW YOUR LOCATION It seems like a basic thing you would expect an emergency service to be able to figure out, but they DON’T, THEY CAN’T, UNLESS YOU TELL THEM Here’s a video John Oliver and Last Week Tonight did on how 911 dispatch works When I was in a car accident and had to get my mom to the hospital last year, it took 5 minutes just for me to confirm with the 911 dispatcher that they knew where I was, and even then I watched while they whizzed past the street where we were waiting. The most crucial thing first responders have to know in the case of an emergency is where you are. Don’t skip this information, please.  " False text

Greg Abbott signed into law Senate Bill 4: racist, anti-immigrant legislation that puts a target squarely on the backs of nearly half the population in the state. In “an act of political cowardice designed to avoid mounting protests,” Abbott signed SB4 in private through a Facebook Live stream, and without a press conference or notice to media. Abbott and the bill’s backers have tried to pass it off solely as “anti-sanctuary cities” legislation, but it in fact does much more lasting damage than that, aiding Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda by promoting “racial profiling and discrimination against those who might be received to be immigrants—even if they are U.S. citizens, through the ‘show me your papers provision.’”  […] “Abbott and Trump will be judged harshly by history for targeting for expulsion people who are deeply rooted in local communities and indispensable to the economy of Texas,” said immigrant rights leader and America’s Voice executive director Frank Sharry. “Should this law be fully implemented, it will brand Texas as a racist state whose Republican leadership is more interested in scoring political points with its nativist base than in building a Texas for all.” Opponents included local law enforcement leaders and experts, who say that the bill will instead undermine community safety by breaking the fragile trust between immigrants and police. “We rely on all members of our community, regardless of race, religion, or national origin, to report crime,” wrote Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez in a recent op-ed against SB4. “We cannot drive crime victims and witnesses to crime into the shadows without undermining local public safety.” Already, police in the state have reported that the number of Latinos reporting rape is down nearly 43 percent from last year due to fear of deportation.

Rape was instead a political crime, committed ‘for many of the same reasons that blacks were lynched by gangs of whites’. It was a crime not of passion, but of cold premeditation, often coordinated among a group. However and wherever it occurred, the motive was not sex, but power. Various studies found that testosterone levels were not higher in rapists. Nor did sexual deprivation correlate with rape: the surveys conducted found that, if anything, rapists had more consensual sexual partners than other men. Psychologists had initially studied incarcerated rapists because they were available. But only a tiny fraction of sex offenders are ever incarcerated, and they are atypical of all men who engage in sexual violence. Convicted sex offenders are much more likely to have assaulted strangers, used a weapon, deployed unnecessary violence, and hold previous criminal records. These men are almost never college-educated professionals or well-regarded members of their communities – characteristics that we now know do not preclude men from raping. …as long as the word ‘rapist’ didn’t appear in the questionnaire, men were comfortable answering ‘yes’ to questions such as: ‘Have you ever had sexual intercourse with an adult when they didn’t want to because you used or threatened to use physical force?’   it turned out that respondents somehow didn’t realise that this was a description of rape. Furthermore, in personal interviews, men who admitted to non-consensual sex made no attempt to claim that there had been a misunderstanding. They knew their victims were unwilling. They were just terrifyingly bad at making the connection between non-consensual sex and rape. The conclusion seemed to be that rapists weren’t monsters, totally distinct from normal men, but did tend to be (to use layman’s terms) misogynist arseholes.  If relatively common levels of callousness, selfishness and sexism can turn a man into a rapist, the problem seems insoluble.  As one rapist said: ‘I knew I was doing wrong. But I also knew most women don’t report rape, and I didn’t think she would either.’ As Scully put it, her subjects saw rape as ‘a rewarding, low-risk act’. Scully concluded that most rapes are the result of a ‘rape culture’ that tells men that, in many situations, raping women is not only normal behaviour, but completely safe. Apparently, even in the midst of the violence of war, men are capable of refraining from sexual assault if they know there will be consequences. The commonsensical conclusion is that rape, like other crimes, can most effectively be prevented by deterrence. This seems obvious; which makes it only more surprising that so much energy has been devoted to avoiding preventative thinking. The history of research into rape’s causes is a history of trying to redefine rape as something that needs a medical solution, or a political solution, or as the inevitable result of male sexuality, which cannot have any real solution: as anything but a crime that must be punished. This bias almost certainly springs from an unwillingness to acknowledge that the suffering of female victims is important enough to merit the punishment of male perpetrators.  Even when punishment does enter the discussion, it is usually framed as a means of obtaining justice for individual victims, rather than as a means of preventing future crimes.

They are, in fact, doing exactly what Marvel has asked: waiting until the story ends.That’s not what Marvel wants. Marvel wants us to pay $3.99 a month for Captain America: Steve Rogers and $4.99 a month for Secret Empire and god only knows how much for all the various one-shots and tie-ins until this disaster is over. They’ve heard “your story is offensive and bad” and their response is, inexplicably, “We hear you. Please continue to give us at least $9 every month until we decide to stop telling it. Do not tell us what you think of it in the meantime (unless you choose to praise us).” […] “In other words, according to Marvel, you must agree to give them money before you know if you’ll like a book, and you cannot stop once you know that you don’t. Because somehow that wouldn’t be fair?”  I’ve actually had a lot of thoughts about this recently because it kind of ties into the work I used to do with extribulum. When I was posting a novel, chapter by chapter, and getting feedback, I would adjust, tweak, and rewrite later chapters based on what I was hearing. And then I would go back and rewrite what I had already posted, before it went to press. I wanted to give my readers a story they wanted to read, a story they felt was worth paying money for. Lots of fan writers adjust their stories based on fanfic feedback too. We, as a culture, as Marvel’s culture, are used to this. Only Marvel isn’t.  So I kept thinking, Marvel is telling a story in increments too, like I did, like fanwriters often do. They really don’t need to double down. We do love these characters, that’s obvious, so if Marvel just…stopped…we would go back to buying comics.  You don’t have to finish this story or even fix it. You have a loyal user base. You had to turn Captain America into a literal nazi to drive us away. We would come back, most of us, if you just…stopped.  End it. Apologize outside the story and inside the story just pretend it didn’t happen. Maybe even make jokes about the dumb and super offensive idea of Cap being a Nazi in your next story. You’re telling a story and getting feedback as you go and you’re getting paid for it. You can just stop. You can.  But they don’t, because Marvel, as has been pointed out many times, is still selling comics the way they did fifty years ago.  " False link

Under the current version of Steve Rogers’ history, his “core values”  were instilled by Hydra since childhood, leading him to collaborate with  the Nazis and sabotage the Allies’ efforts in World War II; in terms of  Secret Empire itself, he’s plotted and executed a Hydra  takeover of the United States that has left many he pretended to be  friends with for dead, not to mention actively trying to murder others  to further the Hydra cause. Why didn’t his “heart and soul” kick in  during any of these previous events…? Perhaps that is reason enough to keep reading Secret Empire: to  discover what is more morally repugnant to a brainwashed Captain  America than working to ensure a fascist takeover of the world on two separate occasions.

But I’d like to talk a little about the distaste for Macron on the left, members of which would doubtless insist that Macron is NOT centre-left. But those of us who listened in despair last year to American friends loftily declare there was no substantive difference between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have been here before. Clinton was “more dangerous” than Trump, I believe: how’s that statement holding up for you, Susan Sarandon? How lovely it must be to be able to care more about ideological purity than the genuine threat of actual fascism. How delicious it must be to burrow down luxuriantly in one’s own rigid moral certainties because you will not suffer the real effects of the worst-case scenario. You can instead self-indulgently focus on details instead of staring fearfully at the bigger picture.”  Well actually it’s a lot more complicated than that my dear friends. I’d like to go on a long political rent but i don’t have the vocabulary tools to do so, so i will just give you a link to this article  https://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/french-election-trouble-with-emmanuel-macron-centrism We are not stupid. We know what is at stake. but the new generation is tired of those “false choices”. We are infuriated with the politic as it is now in our country. We wanted some change, not a masquarade, and those two choices (Macron and Marine Lepen) won’t bring them, on the contrary, it will be just the continuation of the system wich bring us the economical crisis and the social crisis we are facing now.Lepen hates strangers, Macron hates poor people, and neither of those hatred will bring anything good to our country right now. SO YES IT IS A HARD CHOICE TO MAKE And if you’re living in France right now, and interested in the well-being of all you would hesitate. Macron said “ decency is too work” spitting in the face of some 3 million unemployed french people, and that is not his worst quote. He’s corrupted, he did not pay his isf (and wants to abolish it by the way) -it’s the wealth tax for those who are not familiar with the french term. So please, do not simplify everything and reduce this election to some simple antagonism. Yes Marine Lepen is evil, I would not vote for her nor i want to see her elected EVER. BUT i don’t want Macron as well, a man who has no program, and gives more importance to profit than people. I’m sorry i can’t explain everything precisely. But believe me, it’s a choice harder than it seems.   Jfc, this is literally, almost word-for-word, exactly what third-party voters/Berniebros said about our election. That sure, Trump was evil, and they wouldn’t vote for him, but they couldn’t possibly vote for Clinton either, because she cares more about Wall Street than people.  Look, I’m sure Macron is not the ideal candidate for anyone who leans left (though I strongly disagree that his record shows that he “hates poor people”)., But to complain about “hard choices” when his opponent represents fascism, antisemitism, racism, and xenophobia is absolutely ridiculous. This is not the time to complain that you didn’t get the “change” you wanted, it’s time to stop fascism in its tracks.  Enough privileged Americans with no sense of history figured it was ok to sit out the election because they were sure Clinton would prevail anyway. They were wrong and the entire world will pay for that. But American have been historically insulated from a lot of the worst of modern history. We’ve never had a foreign power occupy our nation once it was established. You literally have people who can remember living in Vichy France, who helped the Resistance, and fought the Nazis. How can you possibly tell me this is a “hard choice” unless you literally do not give a shit about all the people who will be harmed by Le Pen’s policies?  Either Macron wins or Le Pen does. What side of history do you want to be on?  FFS yes. And Jewish French people, Muslim French people, immigrants to France, etc. aren’t “strangers.” Some of these communities date back centuries. Just…no.  Another thing: there is something profoundly anti-democratic about the far left insisting that they’ve been denied a voice when their candidate is just…not supported by a majority of voters. At all. Melanchon had his chance to run, no one stopped him, but he didn’t make the runoff. What the hell is this “false choices” shit? Your guy was a choice AND PEOPLE DECIDED THEY DIDN’T WANT HIM! That’s called democracy. CC: Bernie Bros still pissed about the Democratic primary.  Yes. Other people not agreeing with you is part of democracy. As we Americans know too well… " False link

But he believes he does—no less under the auspices of  centering economic issues as paramount, despite the fact that control  over our reproduction is a crucial economic issue for women. Indeed, our self-determination regarding reproductive choices is the key indicator of women’s financial security. That Sanders fails to regard reproductive rights as a central economic  issue is perfectly, terribly reflective of his comprehensive failure of  intersectional analysis and policy. That is the problem that I, and many others, have had with Sanders all along.  This isn’t just an issue of Sanders prioritizing reproductive rights over economic issues: It’s an issue of Sanders failing to understand, or acknowledge, that reproductive rights is a key economic issue. Either he doesn’t understand that, or he simply doesn’t care, because it isn’t a key economic issue for (cis) men. And if Sanders were just another old dosey relic quickly approaching the  end of an inglorious political career, we wouldn’t be having this  conversation. But he isn’t. He is operating in an official Democratic  Party capacity (a decision by the Democrats almost as inexplicable as  allowing him to run as a Democrat in the first place). Further to that, he has positioned himself as the arbiter of What Is Progressive.  And treating women’s autonomy, agency, consent, and very equality under  the law as negotiable is a colossally retrogressive position. It is the  opposite of progressive. I am angry that Sanders is obliging me to fight against his profoundly  unprogressive ideas, when I’ve got enough to fucking worry about  fighting against Trump and the rest of the dirtbags in the Republican  Party. And I am angry that the Democrats, in continuing to give a platform to  these garbage ideas, is shitting all over the work Hillary Clinton  busted her ass doing to activate 10 million new Democrats who I’m guessing won’t compromise on women’s personhood, since they supported the candidate who was vocal and unyielding in her support of reproductive rights. Any movement that wants to redefine “progressive” in a way that  deprioritizes women’s personhood is a movement of which I want no part. Bernie Sanders’ “progressivism” is toxic.

But this woman appeared lucid. Sane. Not at all paranoid or delusional. And she had an incision. So an x-ray was performed, and  medical personnel gathered to view the results. But they stood  breathless in disbelief — indeed, while they didn’t find a GPS tracker, “Embedded in the right side of her flank is a small metallic object only a little bit larger than a grain of rice,” Dr. A recounted for Marketplace’s Dan Gorenstein. “But  it’s there. It’s unequivocally there. She has a tracker in her. And no  one was speaking for like five seconds — and in a busy ER that’s saying  something.” “It was a small glass capsule with a little almost like a circuit board inside of it,” the 28-year-old doctor. Shock turned fast to concern when the  doctors grasped what the presence of the object signaled about the  20-something woman’s life — and why she’d handed over the bizarre note. “It’s an RFID chip. It’s used to tag cats and dogs, And someone  had tagged her like an animal, like she was somebody’s pet that they  owned.” In fact, the unnamed woman had been treated as a pet — a possession — by her boyfriend, who sold her for sex and pocketed the money she brought back. She was one of an innumerable amount of victims of human trafficking — a colossal problem in every corner of the globe, including the United States — where Dr. A has residency at a hospital in a ‘major American city,’ Marketplace discreetly noted. That modern day slavery is alive and  unfortunately booming, even in the U.S., might jar the somnambulant  masses — after all, schools rightly cover the nation’s history of  antebellum slavery quite thoroughly. But human trafficking and  exploitation constitutes a modern iteration of baneful practice. “Very plainly,” Katherine Chon, director of the newly created Office on Trafficking in Persons at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, told Gorenstein, “human trafficking is when one person takes advantage of another person for some profit.” Sex isn’t the only reason people buy  other people — human trafficking sadly staffs a number of industries  with forced laborers, from the menial and repetitive tasks of  manufacturing, to domestic service. Under threat of violent punishment —  or worse — victims often endure horrific trauma and find it difficult,  if not impossible, to alert others to their circumstances for  assistance.   Human traffickers should be shot. How utterly sickening.  Can we fucking take human trafficking to be the serious shit that it is? If you think somebody’s boyfriend is the only person chipping people and selling them I don’t know if you’re lucky or just naive, or both. This shit isn’t an isolated incident. It’s representative of an international business model that is disturbingly common. " False link

She’s a van driver for a production company. She works 14-hour days but says she doesn’t mind, says she keeps one eye on the road and the other on the prize — a paycheck that has to last through the dead months. We’re driving through a poor stretch of Atlanta. Dirty streets. Old houses. Plastic toys upturned in front yards, no kids though. The neighborhood is quiet. I live in L.A., land of nannies and gardeners where the hills are alive with the sound of toddlers and leaf blowers. I prefer Atlanta. You can find parking at the grocery store in the middle of the day. In L.A. it doesn’t matter what time it is, the Trader Joe’s is packed with SAHs and WAHs (stay-at-homes and work-at-homes.) We pass a decades-old Buick Skylark. I point it out. “You into cars?” Mae asks. I’m not into cars, but my dad and I once abandoned one of those Buicks on the side of a Florida highway when I was a teenager. That’s how my family did cars — we bought them on their last leg and left them where they died. I tell her how I’d come home from high school and there’d be nothing in the fridge but a bottle of red wine vinegar and a head of lettuce. On the counter, there’d be a bag of potatoes and a bottle of olive oil from the Dollar Store. That was dinner, potatoes and lettuce. “I hear you,” she says. “We had ketchup sandwiches all the time growing up. We didn’t complain. We ate them.” Mae’s voice is rich, melodic, it’s Maya Angelou meets Gladys Knight. I tell her about the time I borrowed red stirrup pants. (Remember stirrup pants from the 80s?) I borrowed them from my friend Marla. Her two older brothers drove Corvettes, one each. Marla drove a more sensible car for a 16-year-old, an Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. But it was new. And it was hers. She let me borrow the pants for a party in her neighborhood. (God knows I couldn’t go in my own shit clothes.) Long and short of it, the pants ripped in the calf. My mother wept like death had come, struggling with red thread, looking at me like I’d done the worst thing ever. Marla wanted $17 to replace them. Mae invites me to sit up front with her. The traffic to my hotel is bad, we’re in for a haul. I switch out at the next red light. “So her brothers drive corvettes?” Yup. “One each?” Yup. “Lord Almighty,” she says, “folks of privilege don’t understand how $17 can ruin you.” Mae tells me how she’d come home from school and her mother would hustle her and her sisters upstairs to pick out clothes for the next day before the utilities cut off. Too many red notices. I was poor in Florida. Mae’s from Detroit. I ask what she did to keep warm. “Poor kids just do what they gotta do. Privileged kids panic if they can’t have new this and new that, or if they can’t be on a sport team. Sports and heat, those are luxuries.” I ask if she’s heard of John Prine, the folk singer. I sing his line: It’s a half an inch of water and you think you’re gonna drown. She howls, “Rich folks standing in a puddle screaming!” I tell her about my parents shaking me awake in the middle of the night whispering, we have to go now. There’s a difference between going and getting out. What we were doing was getting out before morning, before the neighbors would see us evicted. “I hear you,” she says. “Lord Almighty, I hear you.” America loves helping the shoeless, iphoneless, voteless, bug-infested Street Jesuses. These are the lost-cause poor; all they want is your pocket change. (Bless their hearts.) But the working poor? Those who claim to not have enough money for food because they also need clothes for work, water for bathing and laundry, rent for housing, heat in the winter, money for daycare, a smartphone for their job, car insurance and gas — those are some shifty motherfuckers. If you’re on food stamps America has every right to hate you, as evidenced by this angry conservative yelling at a father and child for using food stamps. This lady proves conservatives love a good hate like they love a good steak. I assume she thinks of herself as a nice person, a good person, a church-goer. We all think everyone else is the asshole, right? There isn’t a lot of self-directed road rage out there. How often do we key our own cars? It’s always okay to hate the other guy when the hate is justified — like child predators, rapists, and food stamp users. Huddled round the Fox News campfire are those who love tall tales of poor people using tax dollars to buy drugs and alcohol and Gucci shoes. That’s not how it works. I’ve been on food stamps. The government doesn’t hand out wads of cash. When you qualify for food stamps you receive a plastic grocery card that only works for food transactions. Key word: qualify. You don’t just sign up. It’s not a tennis lesson at the club. What’s scary about the woman in the video is that she sees what’s in the dad’s cart (food for his kid) and she hates him for it. Stupid fucking poor people. If only we’d been engineer majors in college. If only we’d gone to college. If only our parents hadn’t been poor. If only they spoke English. If only we worked harder. If only we were more like conservatives who believe everything they have today is a direct result from the sweat of their own brow. When looking at a spider’s web can you point to the 8th spun web, or the 108th? There are those who claim this astounding ability — those who take full credit for crafting, spin by spin, a better life than ours, a life without aid. If you had help paying for college, if someone bought you your first car, if you had health insurance growing up, if your mom never cried over $17, you were lucky. The Hail Mary toss of birth landed you in a family that could put you on a soccer team and buy cleats as your foot grew. And someone was home to help you with your math and give you a gummy vitamin each morning. That’s called aid, by the way. And not all kids get it, but all kids should. Don’t confuse aid with charity. Charity is old coats. Donating a coat doesn’t make you a good person but I bet it makes you feel like one. You didn’t even want that coat anymore, what you wanted was the closet space. Sure, you could have sold it at a garage sale and made, like, twenty bucks. It was an expensive coat, damn it. But you, with your heart of gold, gave it away. There’s a twinkle in God’s eye just for you. What makes you a good person to others (and not just to yourself) is the same thing that makes me, or anyone who can afford the occasional $12 cocktail, a good person: Your vote. Not your coat. Vote for a Living Wage for others. Vote for health insurance for others. Don’t get in the way of food stamps for others. Understand how important $17 might be to others. That poor stretch of Atlanta is quiet because people are working and paying for day care. They’re clocking the same hours you’re clocking, but they make a shit wage.  Take a good long look at your feet. If you were born at the starting line wearing a nice pair of running shoes, that was luck. Sheer luck. The most important thing you can do now is help those who had to start the race a mile behind you, barefoot.  " False link

Gender and the Future of Genocide Studies and Prevention   as the rest of this article explains this isn’t to say that men have it worst in a genocide, but that it’s important when you see a very common red flag for genocide to pay attention to the “conflict” in case any more markers of an impending genocide occur.  the g word is really loaded and i’m not bringing this up because i want to start an avalanche of “CHECHNYA IS COMMITTING GENOCIDE AGAINST GAY PEOPLE” fear mongering (that is the absolute last thing that i want). it’s just not possible to prevent any genocide without questioning whether a current conflict might eventually get there. and i do not think it’s nothing that genocide watch is reporting on this.  UPDATE 4/10/17 Chechnya has opened concentration camps for gay men    Gay men arrested in a ‘purge’ in the Russian region of Chechnya are being held in concentration camp-style prisons, reports have alleged. Early reports emerged earlier this month that gay people are being targeted in the region, which is part of Russia but has substantial autonomy. Russian newspapers and human rights groups report that more than 100 gay men have been detained “in connection with their non-traditional sexual orientation, or suspicion of such” as part of a purge. Several people were also reportedly feared dead following violent raids. In a chilling response, a Chechen government spokesperson denied that there are any gay people to detain, insisting that “you can’t detain and harass someone who doesn’t exist in the republic”. The Kremlin denied any knowledge of a purge. But reports have since emerged that the men arrested are being kept in horrific concentration camp prisons, where violent abuse and torture is common. Based on interviews with eyewitnesses and survivors, Novaya Gazeta reports that a secret prison has been set up in the town of Argun to detain the men arrested in the purge. One man who was released from the camp told the newspaper that he was subjected to violent “interrogations” at the camp, as Chechen officials attempted to get him to confess the names and locations of more gay men. The officials also seized his mobile phone, targeting his network of contacts regardless of whether they were gay or not. The camp was reportedly set up by Chechen forces in a former military headquarters in the town. The newspaper reports allegations that the Speaker of the Parliament of Chechnya was among officials to visit the site, though the claims have not been substantiated. The detainees face electric shock torture and violent beatings, while some of them have been held to ransom and used to extort their families. Tanya Lokshina of Human Rights Watch wrote: “For several weeks now, a brutal campaign against LGBT people has been sweeping through Chechnya. She continued: “Law enforcement and security agency officials under control of the ruthless head of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, have rounded up dozens of men on suspicion of being gay, torturing and humiliating the victims. “Some of the men have forcibly disappeared. Others were returned to their families barely alive from beatings. At least three men apparently have died since this brutal campaign began.” She added: “These days, very few people in Chechnya dare speak to human rights monitors or journalists even anonymously because the climate of fear is overwhelming and people have been largely intimidated into silence. “Filing an official complaint against local security officials is extremely dangerous, as retaliation by local authorities is practically inevitable. “It is difficult to overstate just how vulnerable LGBT people are in Chechnya, where homophobia is intense and rampant. “LGBT people are in danger not only of persecution by the authorities but also of falling victim to ‘honour killings’ by their own relatives for tarnishing family honour.”  What Can We Do?    Alexander Artmyev from Amnesty International spoke to Metro.co.uk. He said that people who are not in Russia can help by joining the charity’s Urgent Action on Chechnya. The action encourages people to write in Russian or your own language to Chairman of the Investigation Committee and Acting Head of the Investigation Committee for the Chechen Republic. Amnesty has also asked the letter, which should ask for an investigation and appeal for protection for LGBT individuals, to be copied into Human Rights groups and diplomatic missions from your country.
