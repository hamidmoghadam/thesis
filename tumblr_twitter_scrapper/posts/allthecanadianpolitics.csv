What they don’t know is that the teachers at SPHS actually bribed their students with McDonald’s to go, regardless of their stance on abortion.  Essentially, they were bribed, and occasionally actually coerced into going, to show support for a stance that harms primarily women, an issue that, quite frankly, cis men do not have the right to talk about.

Sentences for manslaughter in which a firearm is used range from a minimum of four years in prison to a life sentence.Jean-Pierre’s death led to unrest in the borough — including a violent night of protest during which the local police station was vandalized — and renewed calls for improved race relations in Montreal North.The protest had coincided with a vigil to commemorate the life of Fredy Villanueva, an 18-year-old who was shot and killed by police in the borough in 2008.

Well, it looks like Canadian conservatives are gearing up for Round 2.Last week, Former Finance Minister Joe Oliver used his column in the Financial Post to complain about donations by American organizations to Canadian non-profits. This week, a complaint filed with Elections Canada by a group called Canada Decides is alleging “foreign influence” in the 2015 federal election, even claiming that progressive organization Leadnow was “spawned” by foreign money.The group, fronted by former Conservative MP Joan Crockatt, also includes two other directors: Brent Chapman the husband of former CPC MP Kerry-Lynne Findlay and Chad Hallman, a conservative campus activist and U of T undergraduate. Chapman’s Facebook page appears to regularly promote right wing conspiracy theories about open borders and the funding of third party groups in Canada. Continue Reading." True link

That sets a Canadian record for votes cast in a leadership race, besting the Canadian Alliance’s 120,000 votes in 2000 and the more than 104,000 votes cast in the 2013 Liberal leadership that elected Justin Trudeau. The last Conservative Party race in 2004 saw about 97,000 ballots cast. Voter turnout for the 2013 Liberal leadership race was more than 80 per cent.That number of votes “makes this the largest leadership race in Canadian history,” said Conservative Party spokesman Cory Hann.Another 2,000 members have registered to be there in person to see the party announce its next leader.It’s the last week for voting in the contest, which officially started last March. The party’s auditors, Deloitte Canada, must receive the votes by Friday at 5 p.m. unless members vote in person at one of the few local polling stations or at the main event in Toronto. For much of Canada, that means ballots must have been cast before this week.Continue Reading." True link

Didn’t matter. The scorn heaped upon him by party members was mirrored on stage, as the remaining candidates lined up to resoundingly reject the notion of using a market-based tool to fight climate change.He tried gamely to convince the unfriendly audience that they should choose him as their next leader because he — as the son of immigrants and a representative of the electorally critical ‘905’ area code — had the best chance of the bunch of beating Justin Trudeau in 2019.Given how unpredictable the leadership contest was at the time — and how unpredictable the next election remains — his bold pitch was as valid as any other. In February, the populist and ultra-nationalist campaign of Kellie Leitch had not yet burned itself out. It was still conceivable that a deeply polarizing candidate might emerge as the winner, only to be soundly rejected by the broader electorate.But Michael Chong?Chong has both political and academic smarts. He understands that elections are won and lost in the suburbs of Canada’s major metropolitan centers. He understands that new Canadians form a large share of those demographics. He knows that some of the policies of intolerance the Conservatives bizarrely pushed in 2015 (banning the niqab at citizenship ceremonies, a ‘barbaric practices’ snitch line) were unforced errors that did the party irreparable harm in the suburbs.Continue Reading."

Reporters wanted to ask him about his military activities during the Second World War, but Jung couldn’t say a word about serving in a secret guerrilla unit.When Japan entered the war, the British recognized the potential of using Chinese-Canadians as spies in Japanese-held territories. Jung was one of about 600 Chinese-Canadians who volunteered to fight — even though they still weren’t recognized as full Canadian citizens.“We were people who, even denied the most fundamental rights of citizenship, acted as honourable citizens to serve our country in its hour of need,” he said at a military reunion of veterans in 1987. “And no one can take that honour away from us.”It wasn’t until 1947 that Chinese-Canadians were given the right to vote.Continue Reading."

While we might not be able to prevent the loss of every life, we certainly can prevent many of these if we do more.”Advocates for the homeless have long maintained that efforts thus far to accurately count the dead have under-reported the true scope of the tragedy.Previously, the city has recorded deaths only in city-administered shelters; that number for all of 2016 was 33.The death rate for 2017, if it continues at two per week through December, would top 100 — the most ever recorded in Toronto.Continue Reading."
