It was the night before Iman’s wedding. We were sitting on the rooftop of our building, Me, Iman and Rihab. We were just sitting on the rooftop, talking and watching the lights of the city. Suddenly Iman to cry hysterically. She said to us than the worst thing you can do is to marry someone you don’t love. I will never forget what she said and the way she said it. The whole week before the wedding Iman had just slept. She woke up a few times a day to eat then went to sleep again. I just thought that she was sick and i didn’t understand that she take the sleeping pills to escape the reality in her dreams. The truth was that Iman in fact was really much in love, but not with the person she was marrying. She was in love with Zied. They were young and in love. Zied had promised many times to come and talk to Iman’s dad about their future, but something always seemed to get in the way. Iman’s mother didn’t like Zied. She thought he was still a kid, with no money or a proper job to provide for her daughter. She said to Iman that a handsome young man like Zied would never marry someone like her, she wasn’t even that pretty and her skin wasn’t pale enough. So Iman heartbrokenly left Zied. Then a someone came to ask for Iman’s hand. He was a bit older man with a good stable job and he promised her better living conditions, a big wedding and a happy future. Under the pressure of her mother, Iman said yes. Didn’t take long for her to realize that she had made a big mistake. She tried to tell her mom that she had changed her mind but the mother refused to listen. She didn’t answer the guys calls and he’d come to their house furious of her behavior. Iman was too scared to stay strong so she just accepted her destiny. She thought she had no other choice. So now, 6 years after she has two kids and they are living a quite stable life. Things could be worse, she says. When asking her does she love her husband she answered that she has learned to love him. They share a house, car and two wonderful kids.  She also tells me that she happened to see Zied the other they when she was taking her kids to school. Her hands started sweating and heart racing. She couldn’t stop the tears from falling down on her face.  I don’t understand this “learning” to love someone *after* you’ve made the commitment to marry? Sure, it takes time to get to know someone anyway. But to say you’ve “learnt” is exactly that: you’ve studied up over time as if it’s a school test the different ways to make someone happy and avoid ticking them off.Sigh. This is such a weird concept of marriage we need to get rid of." False text
