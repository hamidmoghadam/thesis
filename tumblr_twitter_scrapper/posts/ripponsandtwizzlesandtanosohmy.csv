Ils ont des personnalités justement avec beaucoup de tempérament, très émotionnels, et comme coach, ce qui est genial, en fait, c'est qu’on doit avoir la possibilité de canalisé l'énergie de cette personnalité-la.

After all, you know that skating is a sport that is very emotional, and people who practice skating are very sensitive. They have, rightly, personalities with a lot of character, are very emotional. As coach, what is great actually is that we have the possibility to channel the energy of that personality. That is to say, we must absorb the negative things, and then must be able to grow and adapt so that we can develop the potential of the student. For me, working with Deniss is just a pleasure and a joy. Every day, to see him on the ice working on the exercises I give him, and yes, all that energy that passes between us, it’s true that I give him a lot of myself, but it’s his work, and I hope I can take him as far as possible."
