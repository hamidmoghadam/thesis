First of all, there is this GoFundMe you can donate to so the victims can seek therapy, there can be memorials and funerals, etc etc.  There’s also another crowdfunding website called JustGiving, they have almost reached their goal so help them out some more! You can also donate money to Human Appeal- a Muslim charity and relief organization who are giving all their funds towards helping the victims in any way, should it be shelter, a way home. So check them out as well. Other ways you can help is to keep in track with the GiveBlood NHS twitter account and see if they need any aid with donating blood. If you live in Manchester, please keep an open eye out for victims and missing people and please do not post any pictures to mislead as they waste detective resources. Also, if you have a spare couch, room or anything, you can tweet out #RoomsForManchester to help out and shelter a victim. Not in Manchester and don’t have money? It would mean the world to the victims and everyone affected if you just simply signed this book of condolence by the Manchester City Council.  Let’s keep supporting the victims and Ariana and mourn them and help everyone.

That’s why they’re always saying “do not be afraid”. Some of them have three faces on one head?? It’s in both Old Testament and Revelations.  i mean, this is my favorite of all subjects so why not chat about it a little. sorry in advance for the essay you didn’t ask for, but i’m getting a lot of smartasses on this post telling me the Edgy Whites aren’t wrong. so let’s go: 1) even if it was true (which it’s not, i will get to that) this wouldn’t be an adequate reason for criticizing or derailing poc who are trying to subvert the association of divinity/purity & whiteness. you know the idea of the aryan race came from the myth of divine whiteness? you know how all fantasy elves are pale slender & white, thanks to j.r.r. tolkein’s prevailing white/christian influence? so if you see poc trying to reframe this, let them! 2) it isn’t true. don’t get me wrong, you can envision, interpret, and portray angels however you want, that’s part of the fun of art and writing and fantasy. i know that a certain post influenced how a lot of people on tumblr imagine angels (again, because people like subverting popularized imagery) but if we’re talking about biblical accuracy, then let’s be biblically accurate.  more specifically, if someone is going to condescend to poc (or anyone!) about the “factual” appearances of angels in the bible, then they damn better get it right.  to start with– angels as winged messengers were popularized after the roman catholic church began co-opting greco-roman imagery, and modeled much of their depictions of angels after hermes and eros. so yeah, the image of pale white angels is tiresome and not technically accurate to the bible. that said, the majority of angels in the bible very likely appeared as wingless humans with occasional supernatural attributes.  biblical angels are understood by theologists & angelologists to exist in a celestial hierarchy, de coelesti hierarchia, which accounts for nine distinct types. they’re organized in tiers, so to speak. within the first sphere are seraphim, cherubim, and ophanim. this first choir resides within the inner sanctum of heaven; they are the lovecraftian ones tumblr is so big on.  the seraphim (isaiah 6:1-8 and revelations 4:8, the burning ones, sometimes interpreted as a mass of serpents, multiple eyes, etc.) the cherubim (isaiah 1:5-11 and ezekiel 1:5-13, multiple wings, multiple faces) and ophanim (ezekial 1:15-21′s iconic Wheels™) are all witnessed by prophets. not in visitations, but in visions of heaven. these are THE scary angels, the angels of the guillermo del toro persuasion.  but, they exist outside of sight from humans, which is why it was exclusively prophets who could describe them. they do not come down to earth to chat with random civilians. they’re too busy with the tasks of the omniscient, and their proximity to god is what makes them so powerful and so otherworldly. (and no, you won’t drop dead just looking at them: only god is said to be that powerful.)  the second choir– the dominions, virtues, and powers– are typically interpreted to remain unseen and work on the spiritual plane, tasked with more menial things than the first choir, keeping the nonphysical realm in working order.  the third choir are the ones who move between heaven and earth to serve humans: the principalities, archangels and angels. these are the ones most regularly described in the bible as messengers, guides, and guardians who take on the form of man in order to serve and aide them. almost every mention of angelic messengers or apparitions in the bible is an angel of the third choir.  (side note: the only angels not accounted for in the celestial hierarchy are the nephilim: the fallen ones who had children by humans, referenced in genesis 6:1–4 and often considered to be demons.) so if the angels appearing to humans aren’t abominations, why do they scare people so badly?  the phrase “do not be afraid/be not afraid” is said in variations over 100 times in the bible, not exclusively by angels. most often it’s spoken as an assurance of god’s love and protection. yes, a handful of times it’s said by angels. (matthew 1:20, matthew 28:5, luke 1:13, luke 1:30, luke 2:10, to name some prominent instances.) almost every single one of these, the angel in question is doing just that– assuring vulnerable or frightened people that god is protecting them.  most notable of these angels is gabriel, the archangel and messenger who appears to mary to tell her she will conceive jesus. let’s look at the context at play: mary was a young unwed woman who would not have been accustomed to spending time alone with young man outside her family. when gabriel appears to her, a strange man in her home, she has every reason to be frightened. gabriel goes on to tell her that she’s going to be the mother of god, and this is when he reassures her not to be afraid, because it will be done through god’s workings. gabriel ≠ an eldritch horroterror.  the second instance is that of the messenger angel who tells the women of jerusalem not to be afraid, but jesus has been raised from the dead. this angel is described as unearthly, and tbqh he’s dope as hell: “his appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.” (matthew 28:5) there’s reason to believe this angel is of the same countenance as the one described in a vision in the book of daniel: “then i lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and beheld a certain man clothed in linen (…) his body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.” (daniel 10:5-7) my fave description of an angel in the bible by far, but… still not an eldritch horrorterror.  in a third instance (luke 2:10), the angelic heralds who inform the sleeping shepherds of jesus’ birth do startle the men, and they do tell them not to fear. but it’s said its the glory of god emanating from them that scares the shepherds, not a monstrous appearance.  the cosmic fear attributed to visits from the divine is called numinous dread, the terror that fills us when we’re approached by something we have no capacity to understand. numinous dread is akin to what makes people quiver at the thought of ghosts, or the size of distant planets, or the expanse of the universe– something incalculable and unknowable to the point of being frightening. this to me is by far the coolest aspect of angels. the fact that the very scope of their existence can tug and distort the fabric of our dimension, to the point that humans are bowled over by the merest whiff of their presence? it’s why angels who appear human but still frighten people is such an underrated concept. you know the phrase “every angel is terrifying”? the author, rainer maria rilke, wrote endlessly on the nature of the human and divine, especially in his work the duino elegies. in the full quote from the first elegy, he mused on the vastness of angels in comparison to mortals: “For beauty is nothing but the beginning of terror, which we are still just able to endure, and we are so awed because it serenely disdains to annihilate us. Every angel is terrifying.” this, to me, is the most succinct and lovely illustration of angels, which doesn’t define them either as monsters or humans– he’s fixed on the feeling of awe that’s inherent to the divine, however it manifests.  none of this invalidates creative interpretations of biblical angels! it just means you should not be talking down to anyone about their level of accuracy, especially in regards to race. in summary: YES, some angels are scary looking in the bible. NO, not every single one looks like edgy white tumblr wants to believe. YES, everybody is allowed to have fun with their interpretations and portrayals, go wild. NO, it’s not even remotely acceptable to condescend to people who want to envision them as people of color because, textually, they manifest as humans in the bible, and everyone in the bible was brown and black.  " False text

Lola is an honorific, used for grandmothers or elderly women. with this article going viral, white people once again rear in their head reprimanding us for our custom of ”“slavery”“ while sloppily throwing around the term Lola, thinking that it actually means slave?? so white people get to apprehend us while doing 0 research of their own all the while? wow.  if it’s a sin for white people to talk over black people, why can’t it be the same for us filipinos?   and if the articles did have anything substantial to teach us, it’s that class differences are still prevalent here in the philippines. so widely prevalent. but, as stated in the article, this wide difference in class structures is also caused our history of colonialism. once again, why are white people reprimanding us for a problem they invented?  in conclusion: please don’t assume that we’re trying to excuse ”“slavery”“. this ”“slavery”“ problem is rooted into a much deeper problem caused by – yes – imperialism. and because of this, white people have no right to paint us in a negative light for something they created and embedded into every patch of soil they’ve treaded on.  how is saying “OUR version of slavery isn’t as bad!!!” and “people who dont own slaves shouldnt be allowed to criticize people who do because muh essentialism!!!” NOT excusing slavery??

The events of the storm and its aftermath sparked a profound shift among black Americans toward racial pessimism that persists to today, even with Barack Obama in the White House. Black collective memory of Hurricane Katrina, as much as anything else, informs the present movement against police violence, “Black Lives Matter.” Among the first images of New Orleans after the storm were shots of low-income black Americans, stranded and desperate to escape the floods and debris. In the narrow sense, they were there because the city’s evacuation plan—which didn’t account for massive traffic out of the region—fell apart. Rather than bring remaining New Orleansians out, officials sent them to the Superdome and the convention center, which were quickly overcrowded and undersupplied. In a much broader sense, however, they were there because in a city defined by decades of poverty, segregation, and deep disenfranchisement, poor and working-class blacks (including the elderly, and children) would largely shoulder the burden of the storm. To black Americans around the country, this looked like neglect. In an ABC News andWashington Post poll taken shortly after the hurricane, 71 percent of blacks said that New Orleans would have been “better prepared” if it were a “wealthier city with more whites,” and 76 percent said the federal government would have “responded faster.” A Newsweek poll confirmed this sense among black Americans that the government responded slowly because most of the affected people were black. “I, to this day, believe that if that would have happened in Orange County, California, if that would have happened in South Beach, Miami, it would have been a different response,” said then Mayor Ray Nagin in a speech to the National Association of Black Journalists, a year after the storm.

Do not prioritize online petitions. Even if a petition has 10,000 signatures, most Congressional offices only count it as 1 piece of correspondence. 2. Snail mail gets noticed. 3. Hand-written notes get read. Reps themselves use handwritten notes to communicate high-priority messages to each other. 4. Calls do help. It is better to call a home office (in the Rep’s state) than their DC office. 5. Follow up on calls and letters. This one was new to me! If you sent a letter or called in, check back a few weeks later and ask if the Congressperson is going to respond. 6. Make the rep afraid of consequences. I’m not talking empty or violent threats - tell the Rep they have lost your vote or donation. 7. Choose specific issues and call or write about them on a regular basis. Start small with one thing that matters to you. 8. Make it personal. If you can, connect the issue to a personal example. Talk about your feelings and concerns from the heart, if you can. Facts or speaking from a script is fine if that’s what you have in you. 9. If you can, state your name, address, and phone number in your correspondences.

From the time I was small and up until now, I was painfully shy in new settings, took time to come out of my shell, and struggled to relate to other folks my age. Finding community that looked like me was even more challenging, which made finally finding it that much more meaningful. I remember the excitement of entering spaces with activists, artists, youth workers, queer folks of color, etc. after a lifetime of not seeing myself reflected anywhere else. I came to realize that much of my earlier silence and shyness came from not being allowed to bring all of myself where I went, but when I discovered sacred community, walls slowly began to come down. I have connected with fierce activists and chosen family in whose presence I am made better. Like most relationships worth having, being in community is not always (or even often) easy. In my circle are people who challenge me to grow, who will collect me when I need to be collected, who expand my political and world views, and who actively live the principles of love and tenderness. (In other words, #squadgoals). “Tenderness” is something I write about a lot because I’ve always been called tender or hyper-sensitive, and up until recently I wanted very badly to change that part of myself. Tenderness is often seen as frailty and as a weakness, especially in the violently oppressive context we live in, but when it comes to building true and sustainable communities of oppressed people, it is a virtue. Tenderness isn’t just a state of how we react or don’t react to what people say/do to us – it’s about how we choose to treat other people. And that starts with how we treat ourselves. " False link

The skin is also especially thin down there, making it easier for plastic chemicals to enter the body that way. Many pads and some tampons contain plastic chemicals and can even contain BPA and other plastic chemicals.  Plasticizing chemicals like BPA and BPS disrupt embryonic development and are linked to heart disease and cancer. Phthalates — which give paper tampon applicators that smooth feel and finish — are known to dysregulate gene expression, and DEHP may lead to multiple organ damage. Besides crude oil plastics, conventional sanitary pads can also contain a myriad of other potentially hazardous ingredients, such as odor neutralizers and fragrances.

As Speaker John Boehner has said, the poor have a notion that “I really don’t have to work. I don’t really want to do this. I think I’d rather just sit around.” In  reality, a large and growing share of the nation’s poor work full time  – sometimes sixty or more hours a week – yet still don’t earn enough  to lift themselves and their families out of poverty.   It’s also commonly believed, especially among Republicans, that the rich deserve their wealth because they work harder than others.  In reality, a large and growing portion of the super-rich have never broken a sweat. Their wealth has been handed to them.  The  rise of these two groups – the working poor and non-working rich – is  relatively new. Both are challenging the core American assumptions that  people are paid what they’re worth, and work is justly rewarded. Why are these two groups growing? The ranks of the working poor are growing because wages at the bottom have dropped,  adjusted for inflation. With increasing numbers of Americans taking  low-paying jobs in retail sales, restaurants, hotels, hospitals,  childcare, elder care, and other personal services, the pay of the  bottom fifth is falling closer to the minimum wage. At the same time, the real value of the federal minimum wage is lower today than it was a quarter century ago.  In addition, most recipients of public assistance must now work in order to qualify.  Bill  Clinton’s welfare reform of 1996 pushed the poor off welfare and into  work. Meanwhile, the Earned Income Tax Credit, a wage subsidy, has  emerged as the nation’s largest anti-poverty program. Here, too, having a  job is a prerequisite.  The new work requirements haven’t reduced  the number or percentage of Americans in poverty. They’ve just moved  poor people from being unemployed and impoverished to being employed and  impoverished. A very clever scheme by Republicans. While poverty declined in the early years of  welfare reform when the economy boomed and jobs were plentiful, it began  growing in 2000. By 2012 it exceeded its level in 1996, when welfare ended. At  the same time, the ranks of the non-working rich have been swelling.  America’s legendary “self-made” men and women are fast being replaced by  wealthy heirs.  Six of today’s ten wealthiest Americans are heirs  to prominent fortunes. The Walmart heirs alone have more wealth than  the bottom 40 percent of Americans combined. Americans  who became enormously wealthy over the last three decades are now  busily transferring that wealth to their children and grand children. The nation is on the cusp of the largest inter-generational transfer of wealth in history. A study  from the Boston College Center on Wealth and Philanthropy projects a  total of $59 trillion passed down to heirs between 2007 and 2061. As  the French economist Thomas Piketty reminds us, this is the kind of  dynastic wealth that’s kept Europe’s aristocracy going for centuries.  It’s about to become the major source of income for a new American  aristocracy. This is what the Koch/Walton Republicans have schemed for; the Gilded Age. The tax code encourages all this by favoring unearned income over earned income.  The  top tax rate paid by America’s wealthy on their capital gains – the  major source of income for the non-working rich – has dropped from 33  percent in the late 1980s to 20 percent today, putting it substantially  below the top tax rate on ordinary income (36.9 percent). If the owners of capital assets whose worth increases over their lifetime hold them until death, their heirs pay zero capital gains taxes on them. Such “unrealized” gains now account for more than half the value of assets held by estates worth more than $100 million. At  the same time, the estate tax has been slashed. Before George W. Bush  was president, it applied to assets in excess of $2 million per couple  at a rate of 55 percent. Now it kicks in at $10,680,000 per couple, at a  40 percent rate. Last year only 1.4 out of every 1,000 estates owed any estate tax, and the effective rate they paid was only 17 percent. Republicans  now in control of Congress want to go even further. Last Friday the  Senate voted 54-46 in favor of a non-binding resolution to repeal the  estate tax altogether. Earlier in the week, the House Ways and Means  Committee also voted for a repeal. The House is expected to vote in  coming weeks. Yet the specter of an entire generation doing  nothing for their money other than speed-dialing their wealth management  advisers is not particularly attractive. It puts more and more  responsibility for investing a substantial portion of the nation’s  assets into the hands of people who have never worked. It also endangers our democracy, as dynastic wealth inevitably and invariably accumulates political influence and power. Consider  the rise of both the working poor and the non-working rich, and the  meritocratic ideal on which America’s growing inequality is often  justified doesn’t hold up. That widening inequality – combined  with the increasing numbers of people who work full time but are still  impoverished and of others who have never worked and are fabulously  wealthy – is undermining the moral foundations of American capitalism.  Just pointing out real quick that the moral foundation of American capitalism is enslaving human beings.  The actual info here is on point though. Organize! " False link
