Knock your teeth out.”  This is almost the exact same thing Rick said to Shane when he finally confronted him about being with Lori:  “I wanted to break your jaw. Let you choke on your teeth. But I didn’t. That wasn’t weakness. It took everything.”   And I love how it all ties together because that last part is what Rick embodied in this whole episode.  Every move he made demonstrated strength. And I’m not just talking about taking Negan’s abuse in stride.    I’m talking about affectionately holding and talking to his daughter. I’m talking about being shamelessly emotional and vulnerable and telling Michonne that he’s afraid to lose her. I’m talking about politely asking this walking Trash Can to stop torturing his brother. I’m talking about swallowing all this shit, shouldering all this self blame, standing tall in his submission, and cherishing what and whom he has left.    He is the antithesis of every crusty, dusty alpha male I have ever seen on TV. He is the antithesis of Shane. He is the antithesis of Negan.   I am so in love with him.  I have some meta in my drafts going into the importance of Rick Grimes as a pop culture white male lead who DOESN’T peddle a false sense of machismo and male entitlement.  That he actually embodies all of the harder shit that being truly “a man” actually is.It’s calm restraint when punching people might make you feel good or get a cheer from the 13 year olds.  It’s crying until you fall down, because your wife is dead. It’s submitting to a lesser person because not doing so will get people killed.  It’s being that leader not because you want it but because people look to you.It’s being afraid, and in love, and imperfect and SHOWING THAT.It’s not some bullshit smug know-it-all smirking white man who always knows the right thing and will talk over and under every token female and POC side-kick to the winning idea only HE knows about.It’s not the righteous asshole who beats his way through the bad guys,to hell with casualties suffered along the way.The REAL MAN is the one who looks to smarter and loving people, who values them and loves them just as hard OPENLY, who sacrifices his own sense of being in the right, of feeling better or comfortable in the moment so they can live better than he does.Love as an action word is what makes a man a man.And unfortunately Rick Grimes, especially as a white male lead in a crowded field of smug smirking know-it-all entitled jerks sold as “charm”  is singular on the TV pop cultural landscape.

You don’t need to be inspired to action. You don’t need to read any more lists and posts about how you’re not doing enough.But, honestly, here’s the thing that nobody really talks about when it comes to success and motivation and willpower and goals and productivity and all those little buzzwords that have come into popularity: you are as you are until you’re not. You change when you want to change. You put your ideas into action in the timing that is best. That’s just how it happens.And what I think we all need more than anything is this: permission to be wherever the fuck we are when we’re there.You’re not a robot. You can’t just conjure up motivation when you don’t have it. Sometimes you’re going through something. Sometimes life has happened. Life! Remember life? Yeah, it teaches you things and sometimes makes you go the long way around for your biggest lessons. You don’t get to control everything. You can wake up at 5 a.m. every day until you’re tired and broken, but if the words or the painting or the ideas don’t want to come to fruition, they won’t. You can show up every day to your best intentions, but if it’s not the time, it’s just not the fucking time. You need to give yourself permission to be a human being. Sometimes the novel is not ready to be written because you haven’t met the inspiration for your main character yet. Sometimes you need two more years of life experience before you can make your masterpiece into something that will feel real and true and raw to other people. Sometimes you’re not falling in love because whatever you need to know about yourself is only knowable through solitude. Sometimes you haven’t met your next collaborator. Sometimes your sadness encircles you because, one day, it will be the opus upon which you build your life. We all know this: Our experience cannot always be manipulated. Yet, we don’t act as though we know this truth. We try so hard to manipulate and control our lives, to make creativity into a game to win, to shortcut success because others say they have, to process emotions and uncertainty as if these are linear journeys.You don’t get to game the system of your life. You just don’t. You don’t get to control every outcome and aspect as a way to never give in to the uncertainty and unpredictability of something that’s beyond what you understand. It’s the basis of presence: to show up as you are in this moment and let that be enough. Yet, we don’t act in a way that supports this lifestyle. We fill every minute with productivity tools and read 30-point lists on how to better drive out natural, human impulse. We often forget that we are as we are until we’re not. We are the same until we’re changed. We can move that a bit further by putting into place healthy habits and to show up to our lives in a way that fosters growth, but we can’t game timing. Timing is the one thing that we often forget to surrender to. Things are dark until they’re not. Most of our unhappiness stems from the belief that our lives should be different than they are. We believe we have control — and our self-loathing and self-hatred comes from this idea that we should be able to change our circumstances, that we should be richer or hotter or better or happier. While self-responsibility is empowering, it can often lead to this resentment and bitterness that none of us need to be holding within us. We have to put in our best efforts and then give ourselves permission to let whatever happens to happen—and to not feel so directly and vulnerably tied to outcomes. Opportunities often don’t show up in the way we think they will.You don’t need more motivation or inspiration to create the life you want. You need less shame around the idea that you’re not doing your best. You need to stop listening to people who are in vastly different life circumstances and life stages than you tell you that you’re just not doing or being enough. You need to let timing do what it needs to do. You need to see lessons where you see barriers. You need to understand that what’s right now becomes inspiration later. You need to see that wherever you are now is what becomes your identity later. Sometimes we’re not yet the people we need to be in order to contain the desires we have. Sometimes we have to let ourselves evolve into the place where we can allow what we want to transpire. Let’s just say that whatever you want, you want it enough. So much so that you’re making yourself miserable in order to achieve it. What about chilling out? Maybe your motivation isn’t the problem, but that you keep pushing a boulder up a mountain that only grows in size the more you push.There’s a magic beyond us that works in ways we can’t understand. We can’t game it. We can’t 10-point list it. We can’t control it. We have to just let it be, to take a fucking step back for a moment, stop beating ourselves up into oblivion, and to let the cogs turn as they will. One day, this moment will make sense. Trust that. Give yourself permission to trust that.” - Jamie Warron  I don’t usually reblog things here, but I think this is a really good thing to read. " False text

People “thin-shaming” me was mostly verbal harassment- you’re too skinny, you look like a boy, eat a fucking cheeseburger, what’s wrong with you why don’t you like food? But guess what, I don’t have a problem finding clothes that fit me. There aren’t companies that refuse to make clothes for my size. There is no shortage of messages telling me that despite the harassment of some, I am still beautiful and ideal even if I’m unhealthy. Despite being thin-shamed, I still PANICKED when I started a medicine that made me gain weight, and I had to really analyze that, because no matter what my culture will still say that “fat is unideal” “fat is bad” and “honestly its fine to starve yourself / but shameful and bad to overeat.”  So “thin-shaming” is shitty because it’s shitty to be judged and have people make assumptions about you. But Fat-shaming is institutional, it’s not just individuals harassment and judgement, it’s potential jobs, it’s clothing companies, it’s media and advertisement, all telling you you’re bad as you are.

Like, Michonne basically saved his (and Maggie’s) life by deciding to tell Team Family about Glenn being kidnapped by Merle. Michonne’s entry into Team Family started by helping them rescue Glenn (and Maggie). Then they bonded over their mutual hatred of Merle after he tried to kill both of them. While I thought Glenn was being a jerk to Maggie at the time, I did love the fact that Glenn kept wanting to team up with Michonne while they were of like minds about the Governor. They didn’t have too much interaction in S4, especially after everyone split up. They brought it back a bit in S5 though. Loved the reunion between Glenn and Michonne after GREATM comes back from their failed mission and Glenn tells Michonne what happened. The warrior arm clasp was quite nice, imo. Then in the second half of S5 it’s Michonne who notices Glenn is kind of losing himself in their recent despair post-Beth. She sees him start to harden up and that is what prompts her to mention that they can be “out there too long.” I love that her motivation is that she wants Team Family, especially the kids, to be safe but wanting to preserve Glenn’s innate goodness was the spark for her. That carries over into their next interaction when Michonne and Glenn lead the scouting group that checks out Aaron’s story. Michonne spends the trip trying to delicately steer Glenn back into hope and optimism. It’s not just Rick she challenges in that episode, she works on Glenn too. Then we have Glenn echoing Michonne’s words in his interview with Deanna, indicating that Michonne got through to him and made him turn away from being a cynic. This allows Glenn and Michonne to be on the same page at the end of S5 and the start of S6 about how to handle the Alexandrians. They both champion for cooperation and patience, while Rick and Carol are all for a violent takeover. Of course we have all of the great stuff in the third ep of S6 when Michonne and Glenn have to work together to get the Alexandrians back home. They both were so lovely trying so hard to save everyone. It doesn’t quite work out for them all in the end but it was great watching the easy harmony with their similar desires to self-sacrifice for the other. Both of them tried to volunteer to light the building up though Glenn “won” in the end. And, lord, Michonne’s worry and quiet fear when she doesn’t see smoke at the end of the ep and she thinks maybe he didn’t make it. Great stuff! Lastly we have them teaming up to go after Daryl (with bonus Rosita) and they both decide they have to go home instead. They have a very lovely talk about Team Family’s past and future. Then a-hole Dwight has to come and ruin it all. Anyway, I can’t believe I just spent that much time on this but I really have a lot of feelings about these two. They are two of my top fav Walking Dead characters and I love that they have such a friendship.

Eudocia Pulido story cannot be understood outside of the context of the Philippine society and history rooted in U.S. imperialism and neoliberal economic policies that have caused the systemic suffering of many underpaid domestic helpers like Lola.  The Philippines is one of the largest labor exporters in the world with 6,000 Filipinos—60% women—leaving the country every single day to work, because of rampant poverty, joblessness, and landlessness. Lured to apply for positions that do not exist, promised legal status and wages, and instead becoming undocumented, drowning in debt, and isolated in a foreign country – thousands of OFWs end up working in virtual slavery. Recruiters and employment agencies take advantage of their workers, by charging exorbitant fees and loans and threatening their workers with deportation or physical violence to the workers and their families. Living in fear and with no place to go, many OFWs endure the discrimination, abuse, and exploitation in order to survive.  It is important that we do not whitewash the writer’s parents’ and family’s crimes of slavery, imprisonment, and trafficking. Alex Tizon’s account of Eudocia Pulido’s story does not exonerate him from his family’s complicity in the abuse and exploitation of another human being. And we also must recognize this particular experience is not an isolated one, and stems from the Philippines’ feudal patriarchal and imperialist structure. The commodification and exploitation of generations of Filipina women continues to be an inherent effect of the ever worsening conditions–conditions which will persist and generate many more Eudocia’s until comprehensive and fundamental socio-economic and political changes are made to address the root causes of the country’s poverty.  Members of GABRIELA USA continue to take action and call for an end to the exploitative system in the Philippines and denounce the Philippine government for its neglect of its own people within the country and lack of protection of OFWs abroad. In addition, we uplift the voices of Filipino migrant women to tell their own stories. GABRIELA USA seeks to empower migrant women to know and understand their rights, to fight back against oppression and exploitation, and to participate in the movement for national democracy in the Philippines. If you are moved by Lola’s story we encourage you to join a chapter of GABRIELA USA and join the fight against feudal-patriarchy and the systems of power that allow women like Lola to be forced into exploitation.  ### " False text

A little over a year after Meghie finished her first film, her second, Warner Bros. and MGM’s “Everything, Everything,” premieres in theaters everywhere. That sort of movie-deal whirlwind doesn’t often happen to women, let alone black women. But as the film industry roils with conversations about representation and diversity in front and behind the camera, Meghie’s long-gestating talent was perfectly positioned to rise. “There’s a conversation that’s happening right now that is helpful,” said Meghie. “But things are [only] going to change when projects like [‘Everything, Everything’] are made and they hire more women and minorities to direct and write.
