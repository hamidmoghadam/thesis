But apparently eating grapefruit while on Viibryd increases its potency. Here’s the thing that gets to me about this though: I know herbs, alcohol, and other medications can cause reactions when taken with any medication, but fruit? I’m supposed to avoid a specific fruit while on this and nobody told me? And it’s not even something rare that you probably wouldn’t find except at Whole Foods, it’s a standard breakfast fruit. A little heads up “hey grapefruit can do some shit while you’re on this so avoid it” would’ve been nice. But no, they don’t tell you this. So, yeah. A quick Google search. Go do it.  @stereks i’ve never heard it before, maybe it is a common thing and i just didnt get the memo? I dunno.  Just googled my meds and apparently sertraline (Zoloft etc.) isn’t good with grapefruit either  Grapefruits interact with a lot of drugs by either increasing or decreasing their potency, and it might be safer to avoid eating it unless you double check that it doesn’t interact with your medications (I take quite a few and don’t really like grapefruit anyways, so I don’t bother.) https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapefruit–drug_interactions Here’s a link to why it does that, and some medicines that it affects.  I’m on sertraline and was told this but just in case you weren’t, here you go!  This is actually SUPER common, especially with antidepressants. Stay safe y'all  You should also avoid grapefruit while taking Valium or related medications. I like grapefruit but after realizing how many things it interacts with, I don’t keep grapefruit juice in the house anymore (I used to, I love it) because I might forget in a cog fog and use it to take my meds with. My fave grapefruit juice is a ‘rare treat’ now instead of a routine drink. Be careful. <3   grapefruit reacts with so many meds and no doctor ever tells you that shit.  grapefruit is just this weird ass anti med fruit. me, my sister and my dad can’t have it and its for three different sorts of medication   Yeah, it has something to do with how your body absorbs the medication?

Canyon Mansfield, 14, was playing with his yellow Labrador retriever, Casey, on Thursday afternoon near his home east of Pocatello when he saw what he thought was a sprinkler head on the ground and touched the device, causing it to detonate. The explosion sprayed the boy and his 3-year-old, 90-pound (40 kg) pet with toxic cyanide gas, according to the boy’s mother, Theresa Mansfield. “Canyon said there was a bang like a bomb, then an explosion of an orange substance that covered him and Casey, who was writhing in pain on the ground before he died right in front of Canyon,” she said. Her husband, Pocatello physician Mark Mansfield, rushed to the scene and pounded on the dog’s chest in a futile effort to revive the animal. The family and first-responders underwent decontamination procedures and the boy, who was sprayed in the face, was tested for cyanide poisoning at a hospital for the second time Friday, officials and family members said. The device, called an M-44, was among several placed in the area by Wildlife Services, an arm of the U.S. Department of Agriculture that targets coyotes, wolves, cougars, foxes and other animals considered nuisances to farms and ranches. The agency has been sued by conservation groups claiming that its programs to poison, trap and shoot various predator species violate federal environmental and wildlife protection laws.

Many members of the white nationalist group have been outspoken Trump supporters, including the founder of the movement itself, Richard Spencer. Trump has also appointed Steve Bannon as his chief strategist — a man who has been heavily associated with the “alt-right.” The “alt-right” is known for its extremist and racist views, as well as being severely anti-Semitic. It seems like the association between the Trump campaign and neo-Nazis won’t be broken any time soon, as his chosen national security advisor, General Mike Flynn, recently met with Heinz-Christian Strache — the head of Austria’s far-right Freedom Party, which was established by former Nazis after World War II. The Freedom Party was originally created to be a safe haven for Nazis and Nazi sympathizers after World War II and the Holocaust. In the ‘80s, Jörg Haider became its leader, and the party took a turn toward right-wing populism with a strong anti-immigration stance. As the New York Times explains, today, the party is “anti-foreigner, anti-Islam and anti-globalization” making it an appealing party for Europe’s far-right — much like the white nationalist “alt-right” in the U.S. It should be obvious that this meeting between Trump’s National Security Advisor and the leader of a neo-Nazi movement is extremely alarming. This meeting calls back to the words of representatives from the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, who spoke out after the “alt-right” held a chilling conference in Washington D.C. praising Trump. They reminded us, through their statement, that the Holocaust didn’t begin with killing – it began with words.    Well we know which Magazine is getting shutdown on January 21st.

Yeah. About that: The rabbi’s voice began to break. For several seconds, the park was silent, save for the sound of Roston sniffling. “You let us know that we are not alone,” she finally said. “You let us know that our community, that our amazing magnificent town of Whitefish, is not only protected by great, divinely formed mountains of earth — this town is protected by a wall of humanity that refuses to be quiet or sit still in the face of bigotry, racism, sexism, homophobia or anti-Semitism.” TL;DR – the entire town rallied around their neighbors. They got unequivocal, strong, bipartisan support from state officials. Reinforcements arrived from around the country. And the nazis fucking bailed. They never even showed up. That article needs editing, but it’s worth a scan for the lessons in it. The one I’m holding onto is that we can never give these clowns power they don’t actually have, especially the nameless online assbags. We can’t cede an inch. If we care about each other, and just show up, they will lose every. fucking. time.  " False link

I am capable of the act, yes. Then you should. May I? The answer to that is also yes. My mother told me that violence was never the answer. My mother told me I was handsome; you can’t always listen to your mother. What happened to letting the other guy throw the first punch? Nazis don’t throw the first punch. Nazis burn the first Reichstag. Aren’t the Left supposed to be the tolerant ones? Supposed to be the smart ones, too, but they keep falling for that “I  thought you were supposed to be the tolerant ones” horseshit. What about dialogue? Dialogue is for reasonable people acting in good faith. Dialogue is  between two acceptable positions. “Taxes need to be raised” vs. “taxes  need to be lowered” is grounds for dialogue. “Taxes need to be raised”  vs. “Jews should be thrown in ovens” is grounds for a beating. But isn’t this sinking to their level? That depends. After you punch the Nazi, do you espouse the tenets of National Socialism? No. Then you’re better than a Nazi. But doesn’t this just give the other side ammunition? The other side in this argument are lying fucks who can twist any  piece of information into a swastika-shaped balloon animal if you engage  them in good faith; lacking a piece of information, they’ll just make  shit up. Might as well punch a Nazi. What about peace, love, and understanding? Great goals, and once we get rid of the Nazis we can get to work on  them. All three are completely impossible when Nazis are about. When should you punch a Nazi? Whenever you get a chance. Preferably when they’re not looking. What if they’re smaller than you? Hit them with your fist. What if they’re bigger? Hit them with a bat. Isn’t this a slippery slope? After we defeated the Nazis in World War II, did we keep shooting people or did the troops come home and start having babies? The second thing. There you go. The slippery slope argument is nine times out of ten  bullshit. Human beings are good with slippery slopes: we build stairs. What if you think you’re punching a Nazi, but you just hit a white guy with a shitty haircut? Run. What should you do if you hit a Nazi? You should run then, too. Don’t get me wrong: punching Nazis is still illegal. We’re discussing morality. But I don’t want to punch anyone. Then get off your duff, mister, and give aid and support to the boys on the front lines. We’re all in this together. Again. " False link

From Mic:  In her own words, Manning told Obama in a letter, “The sole relief I am asking for is to be released from military prison after serving six years of confinement as a person who did not intend to harm the interests of the United States or harm any service members.”  Obama’s decision represents more to Manning than a get out of jail free card — it means the freedom to be herself. During her time in prison, Manning has struggled to receive gender transition-related surgery, which she’s said is crucial to her overall well-being. Manning pointed to her gender dysphoria as the reason why she attempted suicide in July, and it’s why she went on a five-day hunger strike in protest of her prison conditions. A September statement from Fight for the Future detailed the ways Manning was made to present as male, despite being a woman. Later that month, news broke that the military had approved gender affirming surgery for Manning.  Before her hunger strike, Manning wrote, “I have asked for nothing but the dignity and respect — that I once actually believed would be provided for — afforded to any living being.”   FINALLY."
