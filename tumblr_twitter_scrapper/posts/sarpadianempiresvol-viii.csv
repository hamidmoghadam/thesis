It references another card, named God-Pharaoh’s Gift, that has yet to be printed. With the clues we’ve been given so far, however, I think we can figure it out what Bolas is up to, and what his ‘Gift’ might be. Loyal Retainers by Bastien L. Deharme Let’s break down Gate to the Afterlife into its flavor parts. The triggered ability gains you life and lets you loot whenever a non-token creature you control dies. The activated ability can only be used once enough creatures have died.  “Birth and death are both reversible.”—Nicol Bolas (Soul Manipulation)  From a flavor perspective, it’s clear that Bolas’ goal is centered around the dead on Amonkhet. He’s not looking for living Worthy or minions. He wants the people of Amonkhet to die, but he wants them to be in the best possible shape before that happens. So what is Bolas’ end game? The clue is located in The Hand That Moves, from one of Nissa’s visions:   Giants, covered in metallic blue, stomping through streets.    Metallic blue giants? I think I know what’s happening. Let’s talk about Lazotep. Keep reading  This was fun to talk about. There’s some variables here I’m not sure of, but Jay can run with whatever he likes in his own articles. :-) Either way, it’s been clear that lazotep is much more important than Amonkhet signals. We get lots of clues and implications, but we don’t quite yet know the picture this puzzle is creating." False text

I always use Game Day as a chance to brew a sweet deck and see how it holds up in actual matches. This time, there was one card able to tear me away from Eldrazi: Drake Haven.Here’s the list I settled on:Creatures (4):4 Torrential GearhulkInstants (24):4 Magma Spray3 Lightning Axe4 Censor2 Pull from Tomorrow2 Disallow4 Fiery Temper2 Hieroglyphic Illumination3 Commit to MemorySorceries (3):3 Cathartic ReunionEnchantments (3):3 Drake HavenLands (26):2 Geier Reach Sanitarium4 Spirebluff Canal4 Wandering Fumarole8 Island8 MountainSideboard (15):2 Release the Gremlins4 Thing in the Ice3 Negate3 Sweltering Suns1 Chandra, Flamecaller2 Sphinx of the Final WordGotta Love the DrakeDrake Haven by John Severin BrassellDraken Haven is a resilient engine that churns out far more power/toughness than the mana you put into it. If your deck is discarding cards anyway, Drake Haven turns all those actions into 2/2 fliers. Whenever you discard multiple cards at once, each one produces a separate trigger as well. So discard three cards, make three Drakes.The trick is to build a deck that wants to be discarding cards. I had four different versions in the works. I settled on the controlling Blue/Red version because it was the best one when I didn’t have a Drake Haven. Even if I’m not pumping out Drakes, this deck can largely play like a UR Control deck.That’s the Power of LoveCathartic Reunion by Dawn MurinAlmost every nonland card in this deck can fuel Drake Haven. There are two classes of these spells: cyclers and cards that discard other cards.Censor and Hieroglyphic Illumination are the cyclers. Each cycles for only one Blue mana, meaning they can create a 2/2 flier and draw a card for only two mana. That’s an incredible return on your mana. Censor, of course, is also just an excellent early-game counterspell. It helps keep curve-out decks in check to give mine time to deploy Drake Haven. This deck holds a lot of mana up and mostly plays on the opponent’s turn, so cards like Hieroglyphic Illumination that can generate an advantage on their end step are exactly what I need.The other discard spells each play an important role. Like Hieroglyphic Illumination, Pull through Time is great for drawing cards on end step. I split both cards because Pull is better on its own, but Illumination can be cast off of Torrential Gearhulk. The card is perfect even if you aren’t leveraging the discard action, but even better when you are. Cathartic Reunion is more discard for less mana. With Haven out, this spell draws three cards and creates two Drakes for only four mana. Finally, Lightning Axe is the removal spell for big creatures. It’s also only one mana, making it incredibly efficient. It’s also an instant that can be cast off of the Gearhulk. It can also just be cast for six mana (which I did once this weekend). Finally, Geier Reach Sanitarium’s symmetry gets broken when you’re the one creating Drakes. It’s also just good for getting rid of excess lands.Magma Spray is just a premium removal spell in Standard right now. Commit to Memory and Disallow are part of the control package. If you’re discarding tons of cards, Torrential Gearhulk is even better. Sneakily, it can also cast Memory out of the graveyard to give you access to a fresh hand before your opponent.SideboredomRelease the Gremlins by IzzySideboards are always tricky. You want to use them to swing post-board matchups in your favor.My deck’s biggest weakness is aggressive decks (My only loss was to a GW deck that enjoyed turning creatures sideways.) Sweltering Suns is excellent there. An aggressive deck may also side out removal against me, so bringing in Thing in the Ice to block, sweep the board, and end the game also helps. Chandra, Flamecaller can also sweep, albeit later in a game, while also diversifying my threats against midrange and control (Her 0 ability can also create a lottt of Drakes.) I actually ended up siding out Drake Haven in my aggro matchups. There just isn’t time to deploy it, and Gearhulk is enough to win.Control matchups are also tricky. My main board has some cards that are AWFUL against control, like Magma Spray and Lightning Axe. Negate and Sphinx of the Final Word are much better.Release the Gremlins is great against decks with artifacts, removing their cards and giving me Gremlin tokens. I got to face an artifact deck, and was happy to have those lil’ snoots fighting alongside my Gearhulks.Game Day Trial CompleteI ended up coming in second place, earning myself a coveted Glorybringer promo. This deck was a blast to play, but I have a confession to make. Drake Haven wasn’t very good. It was too slow against the fast decks and wasn’t always necessary to beat the slower decks. I think it’s a fine sideboard card in some matchups, but more often than not I think I’d rather have the Sweltering Suns in the first game. Then I’m just in UR Control. This isn’t bad, but I think my brewing and playing has me convinced that Drake Haven might not be worth building around.Also, Torrential Gearhulk is a hell of a card.Until next time, initiates, may your battle strategies evolve with every victory."

I’m happy today to talk about one of these changes – the creation of a new group within R&D called Play Design.  The purpose of Play Design is to be a group solely dedicated to the health of tournament environments, to make sure that playing Magic in structured settings is as enjoyable as possible. This will, of course, impact the quality of these formats even for players playing outside of tournaments. We recently hired Dan Burdick to run this team and are currently staffing it up. This has included moving current R&D members onto the team as well as converting two of our playtesters (welcome Pro Tour 8’ers Melissa DeTora and Andrew Brown) into fulltime employees. We are also looking for additional experienced players outside of Wizards to bring onto the team. Besides having a team solely focused on this task, we’re also changing how we build sets from the ground up to make sure that Play Design is involved at every step. Design, for example, will be working with Play Design to make sure that we are creating mechanics that can be properly balanced. Dan is just settling in, but he’ll be writing an article (appearing in June, I believe) that will formally introduce the team and explain its philosophy. " False text
