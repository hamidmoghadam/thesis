We don’t talk about how we’re too lazy or too cowardly sometimes. We instead accuse love of being elusive. It isn’t. It is omnipresent. It asks us to be better people.

Our impulses, however, generally have ulterior motives. Impulses are reactionary. They are a result of our instincts. When you have an impulse, investigate the instinct(s) behind it. Why do you want to act this way? Is it a genuine/honest feeling? It it because you know you are being manipulated or lied to? It is because you feel targeted/abused? Is it because you are tired/exasperated/angry? It is because you are sad/lonely? Is it because you’re seeking attention? It is because everything inside of you is telling you to run? To fight? To stay? To change? Is it because you genuinely feel affection/love for another person? Is it because you believe this person is trustworthy? Is it because of everything inside of you is blooming? Is it because you are ready? Is it because you’re not ready - but you know that if you wait - you’ll be waiting forever? Is it because you know, deep down, something is inherently right or wrong with this situation? Trace those feelings. Acknowledge them.

She goes on to tell him that she was born there, and was taken against her will as a child. Now that she drives a War Rig, this is the best chance she’ll ever have at returning home. Max asks about the “wives” (Immortan Joe’s Sex Slaves), and Furiosa tells him that they’re looking for hope; but she’s looking for redemption. I love this part of the movie because this is when I realized that this was Furiosa’s story, not Max’s. We don’t know what Furiosa has done, but it’s clear to us that she has done terrible things. And Charlize Theron’s portrayal shows us those things left her character scarred in more ways than one. We also see that Furiosa is an equal to Max. She is just as, if not more, capable than him. And most certainly is a better shot. This is one of the many reasons I love this narrative, it infers a history of violence without showing us directly. We understand these women have been brutalized, beaten, and raped — but that is not who they are, because that is not part of the (current) story. However, we bare witness to the effects of that violence as most of the protagonists are suffering from some form of PTSD. Max suffers so badly we see projections of his hallucinations as he relives his trauma, and guilt over and over. When our protagonists reach the home of many mothers only to realize that “the green place” no longer exits, and the stagnant water had poisoned the land we watch Furiosa stumble off into the sand dunes, dropping her prosthetic and falling to her knees in despair. So often, on the road to redemption we find ourselves in a more hopeless environment than when we started. Part of this despair comes from thinking that arriving somewhere —be that physically, emotionally, mentally, or financially — we’ll be okay. We tell ourselves “everything will be ok once I get to that place”. Then we get to that place and find out it’s not what we thought it would be. The gravity of that realization can destroy us, and our hope. We begin to question how anything could be worth the price we’ve paid. We ask ourselves how much more could be taken from us? How much more could anyone suffer? I know, for me — the most hopeless time of my life wasn’t when I started on the road to recovery, it was 2 months later when I hung myself in treatment. I was at the end of my rope, literally, because I couldn’t see another way out. Redemption wasn’t where I thought it would be, and there wasn’t a chance in hell I could find it somewhere else. Most of us have experienced desperation, and that desperation drove us to change. But what did we do when that desperation ran out? What did we do when we found out that the place that we were headed didn’t exist? Max serves as the voice of dystopian pragmatism at this part of the film. He’s not seeking Vallaha. If there’s a green place somewhere, great — but he’s not counting on it. This world, and his experiences in it, haven’t given the guy a whole lot of reasons to hope. “You know hope is a mistake,” he tells Furiosa. “If you can’t fix what’s broken, you’ll go insane.” And, for a minute, his hallucinations make it seem that Max could be right. When both Nux and Furiosa fail to fix what’s broken, and find their hopes were in the wrong places— they both break. Max doesn’t hope, he’s just trying to survive. Then something miraculous happens, Max’s guilt drives him to action. It drives him to hope, to try. He suggests reversing course to Immortan Joe’s citadel (now conveniently undefended) — a place full of water and food and possibility. Furiosa becomes an apocalyptic Dorothy who went all the way to Oz and discovered there’s no place like home, and that everything she was looking for was there, in this dusty Kansas, all the while. She finds her redemption and winds up not just saving herself, but thousands of people at the Citadel. The film makes it clear that redemption requires sacrifice. And not the type of occultist sacrifice that Immortan Joe proselytizes in the minds of his War Boys. Near the end of the film, we see many of our heroes’ willingness to sacrifice for the sake of others. In the case of the former War Boy, Nux, who is forced to join Max and his companions, we see a transformation from a willingness to sacrifice for his own glory and pride (to be seated in the banquet halls of Valhalla) into a willingness to sacrifice for others. Whereas his attempts to sacrifice himself for his glory are unsuccessful three times throughout the film, his ultimate sacrifice for his friends succeeds. Fury Road serves as a reminder that the road to redemption is more about the journey than the destination. It reminds us that our guilt can be a call to action, that our work isn’t yet finished. But most importantly, it tells us that hope and redemption aren’t some far off place in the distance, they’re right in front of us. Hope is never a mistake. When we run out, we can always find it in another. Even in someone we never thought possible. " False text

Connections between these individual perceptions give rise to the idea of a continuous and evolving “self.” And our memories gives that self a lasting force.What, then, is our “self” without our memories/history? Or, rather, what would happen if someone were to remove/deny some of our memories and add others? By Hume’s account, the bundle would change, and so necessarily would our self. We would be different people entirely.When someone denies your history or tries to rewrite it - they are committing an act of emotional and psychological violence. It is direct and intentional abuse. The techniques used in gaslighting are nearly identical to the brainwashing, interrogation, and torture methods used in psychological warfare by the CIA. Your abuser is trying to change/dictate the essence of who you are. And they will do anything to maintain a position of power or control over you and the situation.Gaslighting is a subtle and nefarious form of abuse that often goes unrecognized, so it’s important to be aware of all its nuances. Because it’s not as “straightforward” as physical abuse, the victim might have a hard time realizing abuse is happening, and can eventually become so worn down that he or she is totally dependent on the abuser to dictate their reality (which is, of course, the abuser’s intent).Three years ago when I was gaslighted, I didn’t realize what was happening. Even in the process of healing from it during couple’s counseling sessions - her behavior was swept under the rug as deluded and dissociative. But my therapist(s) and friends have helped me see that her behavior then and again this past November was intentionally manipulative and abusive.While it was difficult for me to hear (this time) that “she 100% gaslighted you - and I don’t say that at all lightly” from a (trusted) mutual friend, it was imperative for me to hear and have my experience and reality validated/corroborated. My therapist(s) have repeatedly told me “Her behavior has nothing to do with you. She intentionally maimed, manipulated, lied to, and abused you.” My therapist recently told me “resentment was bound to be a part of that healing process” regarding what happened three years ago. And while I realize that I was wrong every single time I lashed out (three years ago), I understand why I felt/reacted so vehemently. I didn’t just feel betrayed; I felt violated, targeted, mocked, and maimed by someone who had repeatedly told/asked me to trust them. And when that trust was broken I was gaslighted, treated with anger, contempt, and given the “silent treatment.” I was told things that didn’t make any sense. That inherently conflicted with the foundations of trust/love and what had been directly communicated to me. I felt like I was going crazy. I didn’t have anyone (then) to tell me that I was being gaslighted and lied to. All I remember is feeling angry, confused, hurt, and sick. I remember having her shove that anger and confusion back down my throat. I remember her mocking that pain, deliberately, to my face.I also remember her atoning for that behavior. Making amends. I remember her telling me, sobbing, in couple’s counseling, “I know it doesn’t make sense to you, it doesn’t make sense to me either”. “I was a shell”. I remember realizing her actions had hurt her just as deeply, if not far more than me, it just took a lot longer for her wounds/trauma to be realized. I remember years of authenticity, love, connection, and vulnerability that were utterly absent and devoid in her during those 4 days this past November. I didn’t even recognize her at the airport when I first saw her. That shell had returned. All I felt in her presence was a hollowness where the essence of the woman I knew once was. The difference this time around was I knew that I was being lied to. I had overwhelming evidence. I had 3rd party and professional witnesses. But I still wanted to believe that she was deluded/dissociative - I wanted to believe that if I spoke to her in love and understanding, she would “come back to me.” I wanted to believe that if I was accepting of her “reality” that she would hear mine. I wanted to believe that the woman I knew intimately, the woman I loved, and who loved me was still in there. But I realize, now, that she never wanted to accept my reality, she wanted to dictate, manipulate, and control it.One of the last things I said to her was “I feel betrayed, abandoned, and lied to. I feel like you’re doing and saying things intentionally to hurt me.”Being betrayed by someone you love, and who supposedly loved you is traumatic. Especially by someone who (repeatedly and publicly) claimed to love you more than anyone else in the world. But having that person, who swore to be your hiding place and keep you and everything they ever promised safe, do the exact opposite and rewrite/deny your shared history (including her own trauma, and everything she ever wrote, promised, and blogged about), intentionally gaslight and maim you intimately (in the same manner as before), and crazy paint you is violent. My flight or fight instinct is more than “stay and fight.” It is much more than reactionary - it is rabid and carnal. Trying to describe the need/obsession I felt to hack her, hurt her, out her, and lash out would be like trying to describe a wolf stuck in a bear trap. It was more innate than anything else I’ve experienced, including any other “need” to use/self-harm - even at the height of my active addiction. I didn’t just want to hurt her or make her pay. I wanted to maim her. I wanted to put her on trial. I wanted to expose her, publicly, especially to certain people (with the evidence I have of the hurtful things she wrote/said about them). But deep-down I knew that behavior would be self-harm. I also knew if I acted on that need/compulsion it would give her the ability to justify her behavior. In fact, I know that’s exactly what she wanted me to do. And I have some of you to thank for holding me accountable. I don’t know if I could’ve gone without lashing out had I not had your support. There is still a part of me that feels that desire (to lash out), but it is no longer a need. I know that she’s a liar. I know that she’s faithless. I know that everything she experiences and says is based in hypocrisy and duplicity. But most of all, I know that she is abusive and manipulative. I know that abuse and neglect negate love and that no one can rightfully claim to be loving when behaving abusively. I know that I am not crazy, deluded, or overreacting (thanks to my therapists and trusted friends). I know exactly what she promised, and what she betrayed because I have overwhelming evidence of all those things (years of letters, blogs, poems, transcripts, screenshots, emails, voicemails, and video messages). I know that she cannot take away the evidence I have, even though tried to erase it and me - but I cannot be erased - not even forcibly. Not by her, and not by her “friends” who betrayed my confidence (in addition to negating/denying her abusive behavior). A coordinated attack by a group certainly is effective at making you feel like you’re losing your fucking mind. Learn from my mistake and only trust people who’ve continually proven their integrity. I’d recommend not trusting anyone who has any remaining connection/loyalty to your abuser because they’re just as manipulative and toxic or being manipulated by your abuser into thinking you’re the crazy one. Get out of that environment, get as far away as possible from them and your abuser as possible. Do not bother with confrontation. You cannot hold them accountable, they do not feel any remorse or guilt for their actions. They do not care about (understanding) your reality, they care about controlling, belittling, and dictating it and you.Our reality, history, and experiences are not up for debate. Being defiant does not make us difficult. It makes us resilient.No-one can make or rewrite us into anything we don’t want to be.Stay Strong - I see you. You are valid. Your experiences are valid. Your feelings are valid. Your history is real. You are real. You are not crazy. What happened to you is not ok. Healing will come. I know because it’s already begun in me. With Love, -T" True text

You’re coming to terms that it wasn’t just deluded or dissociative behavior - it was infidelity and abuse. It makes sense why you developed body dysmorphia because of what she posted, said, and wrote. It makes sense that you feel shredded because she intentionally and repeatedly maimed you privately and even on a public forum 3 years ago. She’s intentionally done things this time to hurt and manipulate you. She lied to, betrayed, gaslighted you and treated you with hostility and contempt both times. She’s shown zero remorse, and last time she didn’t show it for months. That has nothing to do with deluded or dissociative behavior. That’s abusive behavior. She crazy painted you, denied her own words, betrayed her promises/commitments. She lied, continually. Deep down she knows what she’s done and what she’s doing is wrong and hurtful - that’s why she reacted so vehemently both times. Deluded people don’t gaslight, they don’t intentionally main - and they don’t lash out when they’re called out for lying. And this is important for you to accept:  She’s not the person you loved. She’s not the person she was when she was with you. She’s not the person other people thought her to be. She’s not who she promised or claimed to be. The trauma she denied was real, and you’re never going to understand why she would want to go back to that. You’re never going to understand why she behaves so cruelly. You’re not going to understand a lot of things because the person you loved is gone.”Me: “I don’t know how I could’ve been so blind. I trusted her. She promised on her life. She swore countless times “no matter what”. She swore that she would never make that mistake again - that she would never stop loving me. That she would dedicate the rest of her life to proving her love for me. In her own words, she said it was a “stone cold promise”. I know you know - you witnessed some it, you’ve seen those letters and posts.”My therapist: “I did (witness her making those commitments) and have (read those things). And there’s no way around that language. She knew the depth of what she promised. She knew the depth of “no matter what”. The evidence you have is overwhelming. And she deleted her blogs in an attempt to destroy/hide some of that evidence. She’s a liar. She’s a manipulator. And she didn’t just fool you - she fooled everyone. You also have to remember how vulnerable you were when you met - you might have been 27, but you weren’t even 18 months clean at that time, so you had the emotional development of someone in their late teens/early twenties - and that’s when a lot of these abusive relationships start. If you experienced that behavior today, you would immediately walk away from it - you would talk to me about it. You weren’t seeing a therapist when this happened 3 years ago, and if you had been - it would’ve immediately been called out for what it was. Just like it’s being called out right now. She wasn’t able to dictate your reality this time because you were in touch with me throughout the breakup. She wasn’t able to isolate you this time, even though she tried. That’s all controlling and abusive behavior.  But the most disconcerting thing is her complete lack of remorse and her intentionally maiming you, repeatedly. That has nothing to do with you. Her behavior has nothing to do with you.”Me: “I feel like I was in love with a mask instead of a person, for 5 years”.My therapist: “And healing from that is going to take time. Healing from abuse is going to take time.”Me: “My head feels like a vice and my body feels like it’s in a straightjacket”My therapist: “Abuse does that. You’re doing all the right things, I know it doesn’t feel like it - but this is progress.”Me: “It feels like I’m fucking up, I can’t even concentrate at work. It’s affecting me professionally.”My therapist: “That also makes sense. PTSD isn’t something you get to deal with “after hours”. You’ll get through this, you’re getting through this.”Me: “I know I need to be more structured, I’ve been trying to work on 7-8 things at once and I get overwhelmed.”My therapist: “You’re trying to distract yourself too much, allow yourself to feel - but don’t obsess.”Me: “That balance feels impossible sometimes.”My therapist: “Considering that you haven’t lashed out, that you haven’t slept around, and you haven’t used/relapsed/self-harmed/drank I’d say you’re doing a damn good job.”Me: “I just want out of it, out of this. But I know I can’t use temporary escapes.”My therapist: “The only way out is through, and you’re getting there.”Me: “I trust that, and you”.My therapist: “The fact that you’re able to trust that and me is why I know you’re going to be ok. You show up. You’re accountable. You own your thoughts and feelings. You know when you need help - and even though I know there’s part of you that hates asking for it - you’re able to swallow that pride. Anyone is this position would be experiencing the exact same thoughts and feelings as you - and most of them wouldn’t be able to cope without self-harming, and you haven’t done that once.”Me: “I still want to a lot. But it’s not obsessive like before.”My therapist: “See? Progress.”" True text

And it’s not so much that “it gets better”, but it’s gotten better because I’ve gotten better. Because I’ve gotten and continue to get the professional help I need. My mental health ebbs and flows like anyone with Bipolar disorder — but I’ve also learned how to hold steadfast when those waves do come. Generally, I am able to cope with these waves well, but when they are combined with PTSD from emotional abuse/gaslighting they can turn into a tsunami.There are scientific reasons why we (the chronically depressed) feel empty and why we feel absolute of our conclusions when we are depressed. Depression sets us up neurologically for confirmation bias and stagnation. If we’ve been depressed for more than a few months, our brains are physically disabled. That is a fact. And we (especially I) can’t afford to ignore that.Depression and PTSD severely damage the hippocampus, the part of our brains that forms new neurons and interweaves them as we make new memories, new connections, new knowledge, new habits, new emotions, new perspectives, new motivations, and inspirations. When our (depressed/traumatized) brain can no longer incorporate these new experiences our thoughts confirm our bias instead of contradicting it. Our brain is not learning, it is stagnant and stuck. We are unable to learn, and because our brain cannot learn, it cannot contradict our feelings — it can only confirm them. And we become convinced of whatever our (depressed/traumatized) brain is telling us.When we are experiencing depression (in addition to grief/trauma), or even coming out of it — our thoughts, beliefs, and feelings are not enlightened, they are broken.I know that’s harsh, but understanding that fact reminds me that I cannot always make clear decisions on my own, especially when I am depressed/manic/traumatized (or was in the past few months). No matter how convinced I am that my thoughts, feelings, and beliefs are absolute. That’s why therapy, honest connection/communication, exercise, meditation, and even medication are so important. Those things help my brain heal — and reconnect with my emotional center. And it takes months of hard work and treatment before my brain starts to heal and I can fully trust my feelings again.And even then — as emotionally and self-aware/actualized as I am — I still require professional help and treatment. I need to be accountable. I have to remain open and honest about all my thoughts and feelings, daily. I can’t lie to myself, others, or my therapist. Otherwise, those dark thoughts, feelings, and beliefs will fester and take over. I cannot continually heal my brain on my own. And that is not my fault, but I do have a responsibility to do something about it.So when I’m entirely confident that a part of my life feels inherently broken, or even the entire thing — I have to remind myself that I am not enlightened — my brain is sick. And I have a responsibility to continue to get the (professional, personal, and emotional) treatment I need. I also have to remind myself of what I felt and believed when I was not depressed, triggered, or manic. I have to hold on to and embrace the words and love of others.I have to remember that the wholeness I once knew is not gone or lost forever, it has only retreated inside of me. And I need help to find it again, my brain needs help in order to heal. And needing that help does not make me weak. Recognizing that I need it makes me strong. Strong (accountable) relationships keep me grounded, and in check.And if I don’t remain grounded — I’ll be consumed by my own thoughts and feelings. Just like the times before — I gave into grief, hopelessness, resentment, anger, and self-hate because I kept those feelings to myself. I gave into the notion that I was inherently broken and undeserving of love because I refused to share it with others — even the ones I loved the most. I’ve acted out of depressive and manic emotions without even realizing it, and I’ve always regretted it. I’ve said and done things that I’m ashamed of. I felt so entitled to my emotion and beliefs that I didn’t realize what I was actually doing.Simply I was so biased in my own head that I had no objectivity. I was absolutely certain. And if that can happen to someone as self-aware and actualized as me — it can happen to anyone.I have had a couple people over the past few weeks who have taken me aside and said “what’s going on with you?”, kept me in check, and continued to remind me of who I am — and just as importantly — what I need to do. Realizing that I cannot get through this alone is my power. Because it’s also accepting that I can get through it — with the help of others.So thank you. Each of you — from the bottom of my heart. Thank you for caring, for being there, for being my rock, and words of wisdom and guidance. Thank you for being my confidants and allowing me to process what I feel. Thank you for helping me to set boundaries that I would be incapable of setting on my own. Thank you for letting me know that I’ve been letting things fall through the cracks. Thank you for letting me know that I do not seem “present”.Because I’m certainly “not all here” right now — I haven’t been for months. There’s a film that covers everything — the entire world seems distant to me. Depression, abuse, and PTSD feel like a straightjacket. They make it difficult to breathe, much less move. My head feels like a vice.I’m generally a very (single) task oriented person, but lately — I’ve been all over the place. Scattered. Distracted. Unable to accomplish simple tasks because they seem insurmountable. Incapable of solving the problem in front of me because I’m consumed with the 687 more I have to fix after this one. Things that would normally take me minutes to accomplish take hours. I believe that willpower is limitless, but I also know that I can’t “white knuckle” my brain into healing itself or working the way I want/need it to. It’s chemically imbalanced — and I can’t fix that on my own.While the grief, loss, and anguish I feel are inexplicable, I know that I can survive this. I know that I can heal from it. I know that those who have been hurt the most often-have the greatest ability to heal. Because I choose to remain in respect and love — not hate. I choose to remain malleable every minute. Because I have each of you there to remind me of who I am, and who I want to be.One of the reasons that this blog exists is to remind me that what I felt and believed in the dark times was and is not who I am. It reminds me that I cannot repeat the same mistakes and choices, even when I am experiencing the same hopelessness, pain or trauma. It reminds me that I always must move forward, and hope — even if the darkest days may still be coming.So let me say right now for the record, “I’m still going to be here”. Asking the world to dance, even if it keeps stepping on my holy feet.I’m also going to ask for help when I need it. That’s how I know I’m going to make it through because I’m not doing this on my own.I don’t need luck, I’ve got you (and medical professionals).-Troy" True text

She knew what/who would hurt you the most, and lashed out with malice. She did the same thing 3 years ago and purposefully said, wrote, and did things specifically to hurt and manipulate you - for months. And she did it publicly. She lied to you, purposefully betrayed your trust and boundaries, gaslighted you, and treated you with hostility and contempt. Not only did she refuse to apologize, or take any responsibility - she openly mocked your pain. She changed (betrayed/warped) her definitions of love and trust so she could justify her behavior. That’s not just deluded, or dissociative behavior - that’s outright abuse. I didn’t realize that it took months before she felt any sense of remorse last time, and I don’t see how anyone could have dealt with that without becoming resentful. It was guaranteed to be a part of the healing process.”Me: “Yeah, the more I distance myself from that, and her the more I realize that she has a problem with my right to be angry. No matter how badly she treated, lied to, gaslighted, and intentionally maimed me, she believed my pain, anger, and resentment were unwarranted. The privilege of rage is/was reserved for her alone. When my anger did/does jump out of me, she tried to jam it back down my throat as quickly as she could. Then she would try to use my anger against me to prove what an irrational person I was. Then gave me the “silent treatment” just like 3 years ago, although this time - it’s lasted much longer. Abuse can make you feel straitjacketed. I developed physical and emotional reactions to swallowing that anger and trauma - depression, nightmares, panic attacks, emotional numbing, body dysmorphia, eating and sleeping disorders - and I’m sure she “crazy-painted” me to her remaining friends, stigmatizing my bipolar disorder and me being an ex-addict. Even with the (overwhelming) evidence I have - and have multiple 3rd party witness to - she gaslighted me to the extent that I felt like I was losing my mind.”My therapist: “Her behavior has nothing to do with you. She wants to silence you because she doesn’t want to feel guilt, remorse, shame or responsibility. You’re not crazy - what you’re feeling is completely normal. And it’s healthy to feel as long as you don’t obsess and act out on it.”Me: “I lashed out a lot last time. And that was inexcusable.”My therapist: “Again, I don’t know how resentment could have not been a part of that healing process. That doesn’t excuse your behavior - but you owned it, apologized for it, and didn’t act out of it for over 2 years. You haven’t acted out of it this time, not even once - and if I thought you were crossing a line by what you post - I would tell you. ” Me: “I don’t just feel anger, I feel wrath. She swore on her life that she would never do this again - and she did it anyway - without hesitation or remorse”.My therapist: “Wanting her to pay is a normal reaction. You haven’t self-harmed at all in the wake of this - you haven’t slept around or relapsed. You haven’t hacked her - and I know you wanted to - even while you were physically there.”Me: “I could destroy multiple relationships just based on screenshots/letters I have of what she said/wrote about them, I wouldn’t even need to hack her.”My therapist: “That’s entirely a reflection on her. And that’s something to be aware of for your next partner.”Me: “I’m seeing that. I was thinking about the insanity of the language she used to gaslight me and justify her behavior 3 years ago - and if I heard it today - I would’ve just walked out the fucking door and never looked back. I thought that she was just deluded, but I can see clearly now that it was much more than that”.My therapist: “It can be deluded, disassociative, and also still be abusive behavior.”Me: “That makes sense. When she told me that “love wasn’t a choice” for her this time she seemed entirely convinced of that lie, she even cried when I told her that went against everything we had read together, learned in couple’s counseling, she had promised me and written publicly. Then she told me “I’ve always worked differently than you.””My therapist: “That was a betrayal and her justifying her behavior”.Me: “I’m never going to understand how she could blatantly deny her own trauma, words, and handwriting. The amount of evidence she denied/negated is overwhelming.”My therapist: “You’re not going to understand a lot of things - that’s the radical acceptance piece. You’re not capable of deluding yourself because you own everything you’ve said, done, and feel, even the things you’re most ashamed of. She’s not capable of that. She’s not capable of a lot of things (*details and reasons redacted). But mostly you’re not going to understand because she’s a liar”.Me: “I still think about “outing her” a lot, not like I used to - I don’t sit awake at 3am locked in my bathroom thinking about committing emotional terrorism anymore like I did for the first 2 months. I know a lot of that is my ego saying “Do you know who you’re fucking with? You have no idea what I’m capable of. You don’t know the things I’ve done.” I started writing malware once for an hour specifically targeting her phone before deleting it because I knew if I hacked her it would be self-harm.”My therapist: “She’s already outed herself, there are already people (besides you) who want nothing to do with her. It’s only a matter of time before she outs herself to everyone else. Most people would want to hack her too if they had the ability. The important thing is you allow yourself to feel that without acting on it.”Me: “Yeah, plus I know if I let that side of myself out again I wouldn’t be able to cope without using.”My therapist: “What’s she’s doing is equivalent to you using again. Her tracking down your private blog was the normal person’s version of hacking. She has a pattern of intentionally going out of her way to manipulate and hurt you.”Me: “It’s a hard realization, knowing that someone isn’t remotely the person you thought they were.”My therapist: “Not just the person you thought, she person she repeatedly and publicly claimed to be for years. The person she promised to be, swore to be. The person other people thought she was. It’s not just you. She lashed out and intentionally hurt/ostracized friends who tried to hold her accountable.”Me (to myself): “It’s not just me.”My therapist: “None of this is a reflection on you, none of it, not even a little bit. You’ve done and are doing all the right things - and I can’t tell you how rare that is.”Me: “It certainly doesn’t feel that way a lot of the time. Somedays, in the midst of that grief, when I’m sobbing in public - it feels like I’m just spinning my wheels. I feel like all my joints are out of their sockets. But I also know that I threw up every day for the first 6 weeks - and now it happens less than once a month. I know everything I’ve been through has been a catalyst for this, that it’s taught me that I’m always stronger than I think I am. I know when I need to be held accountable when I need to reach out - and who to reach out to and trust. But mostly I’ve learned that those who have been hurt the most also have the greatest ability to heal.”My therapist: “I like that”.Me (with tears in my eyes): “Me too.”" True text

Reading this got me thinking about not just why I got sober (obviously my life had become unmanageable), but why I started using in the first place. I became physically dependent on (addicted to) Oxycontin at the age of 19, after compound fracturing my tailbone (due to a skating incident) and having multiple spinal fusions/surgeries. My habit didn’t start because I was a “rebel”, or because I was experimenting around with drugs in college. I’m literally a medical statistic: (1 out of 5 patients that are prescribed opioids for 10 days become long-term users). I didn’t drink until my 21st birthday (seriously). Of course, I was a pill-head by that point - but I was still obtaining everything legally (and continued to until I was 23). The problem, for me, wasn’t just the physical dependence and being in chronic pain - it’s that oxy (and later - fentanyl) worked better at treating my depression and anxiety than any of the psychiatric medication I had been prescribed.  Simply, I never “chased the rabbit”, or “enjoyed” the bliss. I used because when I was high - I wasn’t severely depressed/suicidal. And instead of developing (healthy) coping mechanisms and emotionally maturing - I became dependent on that drug to deal any type of emotional stress/trauma. It eliminated my depression, so why not use it for other (extreme) emotional duress?  Anxiety over grad school/work? Use. Lonely? Use. Feel guilt/shame? Use. And when the drugs ran out? Drink.The problem, of course - is that I eventually reached the point where I didn’t know how to cope (with anything) without using/drinking. I was, what is referred to as “a high functioning addict/alcoholic”: Triple Majored, worked for a Fortune 500 Company, was charming/athletic. And until I was 25, there weren’t any physical symptoms. I knew I had a problem, and I knew how to hide it, because I felt entitled to it. Not because I enjoyed it - because I needed it to survive - just to get through the day. I even ran (and placed in) two marathons in 2009 (a year before I ODed) just to purposefully throw people off the “he might have a problem” scent. Everything I did from ages 19-25 was strictly by design. I can look back and recognize the exact moment I pushed someone away, or burned a bridge because I felt that they were getting close enough to “find out” that deep-down, I was a fraud. I remember waking up a couple weeks before I ODed in my ex’s bathtub - completely naked, covered in tiny scrapes and nicks, and a soaked towel draped over me - not knowing how I got there, or even having any memory of the last 10-12hrs. Dried blood caking my nose. Looking in that bathroom mirror - where I used to watch her dry her hair in the mornings - not even recognizing the person staring back at me. Looking at myself and saying “How the fuck did I get here?” But not “How did I physically end up in this bathroom?”, I meant “How the fuck did I get here in a cosmic, incorporeal, metaphysical sense? Why the fuck am I here at all? What have I become? I don’t know who that person is in that reflection.”And realizing I didn’t know who I was - outside of my job, outside of GPA, outside of my GRE score, outside of the mind-games and manipulation tactics, outside of the need to use to feel normal - that’s what lead me to get sober. The day after I ODed - I got dropped off at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting wearing hospital socks - the doctor’s words reverberating off the walls in my brain: “if you don’t stop using you won’t live to see 26, much less 30″, and that’s certainly was part of why I haven’t used since. But mostly it’s because, deep-down, I truly don’t want to. The person who needs to use/drink in order to cope is the weakest/smallest version of me. And I haven’t been that person in a very long time. The only thing that ever stopped me was fear. Not of failure. But fear of the pain I would have to bear. Turns out I’m a lot stronger than I thought I was. We all are. That’s why I got sober. (7 years this October)." False link

At the beginning of our “educational” phase of learning, topics need to be engaging. Invoking emotion, humor, or whatever rhetorical trick is available to convince the student/pupil is seemingly worthwhile. Provided that the trick is a way of simplifying a complex subject - not a lie, or a way of controlling the student’s beliefs, or thoughts.In college, education *can* be engaging while remaining intellectually honest and devoid of (outright) appeals to emotion. I know this might seem like a rare case, but if you’re lucky enough to have a professor who treated you like a peer, you know how much of an impact being respected for your own ideas can make - and how it can set you on the path to who you later become.When education becomes about *how* to think and not *what* to think, it is inherently more compelling. I remember the (moral) philosophy and ethics classes I took as an undergrad; and they were the most engaging classes I ever took precisely because they challenged everything I thought I knew. Those professors could have spent the time teaching me what to think (e.g. just what the major moral philosophy theories are) but instead they used a (somewhat) socratic method and challenged us (each class) about what we already believed and how philosophers like Kant, Nietzsche, & Kierkegaard came to their own theories.Of course, intellectual and moral relativism are dangerous subjects because they require coming to knowledge/truth (an epistemology) that no one else has access to and/or that relies on subjective evidence (i.e. emotions/feelings).Still, I don’t believe (higher) education is the enemy here. In Graduate School (for instance), when you hit the frontier of your field - you start thinking about problems no one ever thought about. You start thinking about solutions to the problem no-one else has thought about. Stylized dry writing is easer to evaluate for correctness. You don’t want an emotional investment (despite how personal the subject is), you want to convey an objective view so it can be picked apart based on its own merits. If that stands up, seems correct, or at least worth more investigation, then it can be dressed up in the easy to communicate way.However, some ideas can’t be evaluated (at all) without investing in their emotional content. That’s a difficult place to find truth. Perhaps that’s why art, and - in turn, why media exists.While I believe (popular) media (especially books) can communicate thoughts and questions that academia is incapable of, I don’t think you’re going to discover the answer to life’s questions by watching a Taylor Swift music video on Youtube. But who’s to say really? Is “Breaking Bad” really just a story about meth, or is it an existential moral conflict? Is “Mr. Robot” just a story about NY Hackers, or is it a compelling descent into madness? Is “Out of the Woods” the catchiest song ever written, or is it about the possibility of an unperceived existence? (That’s a “If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?” joke).I guess that depends on who you are.PS: I don’t think the Guardian gets Nietzsche." True link

I feel like my life is closing in around me, like there’s a dark cloud hanging over everything and slowly enveloping me in a kind of blurry panic. It’s staining everything I see and making it harder and harder for me to notice the good things when I’m surrounded by so many bad vibes. How do I make my way through this? How do I see in the dark?Help,Losing My LightDear Losing My Light,Sometimes a dark time isn’t necessarily a bad time. What you’re experiencing is a transition, the end of one chapter of life and the beginning of a new one. As the sun sets and night falls, we can feel a sense of loss — longing for the warmth and brightness of the day, when we could see things clearly and take comfort in the security of life at its most illuminated and transparent. But only a fool would expect the day to last forever, and even the longest day must eventually come to a close. The wise person learns not only to accept this transition, but to appreciate it — to see the night and its darkness as an absolute necessity, a natural companion to the day and its brilliance.We must not mistake the experience of darkness as a sign of torturous death or the end of all good things. It is just a turning point, a part of a cycle. And once the darkness has completed its part of the pattern, the shadows will retreat, the sun will rise, and the light will return once more. We must be able to accept and love the cycles of life, and learn to recognize these signs of transition as part of the ever-unfolding and developing nature of life.The best thing we can do is use these moments of darkness to rejuvenate and recover our strength, to absorb and grow and prepare ourselves for what comes when the light returns. Do not be afraid of the dark. Do not resent it, and do not seek to artificially illuminate yourself out of desperation. Much like the body wants rest and recuperation during a good night’s sleep, the soul and spirit needs to slumber in these moments of transitory twilight. It needs to succumb to the natural spiraling movement between light and dark, positive and negative, something and nothing. It’s in this space that we come into form; in this space, we hover between being and becoming. This is what life is, and to fight it is futile and counterproductive.Learning how to allow oneself the space to simply exist is one of the great lessons life can teach us. And it is during these moments of darkness that we sometimes have no other choice but to simply…live. Because it is in that nonjudgmental and non-panicked state of calm acceptance that we can see the dark and the light for what they truly are: both part of one beautiful pulse. Take a light switch, for instance: It must be in the on or off position; it can never be both. Inhale, and exhale. You can’t hold your breath forever or not breathe at all. It’s the back-and-forth of existence that allows us to exist at all.Most of all, don’t lose hope. Don’t close your heart or make drastic decisions out of desperation. Just know that you are going through these natural ebbs and flows in life, and they’re an absolutely necessary aspect of being a person. Sometimes the pain we feel is simply the discomfort of growing. Sometimes the darkness is just a shadow cast by a beautiful and radiant light. Sometimes our hardest moments will reveal themselves to be the most rewarding and important experiences of all.Stay strong and remember that you are the light that will continuously see you through all the challenges and darkness you encounter. The shadows aren’t always bad. Sometimes they’re just the result of so much light around the corner.Your friend,Andrew W.K." True link

You simply don’t know enough to be doing this, and in doing so, you are hurting people’s perspective of the industry.”Jamie and I eye-rolled when we saw the above article, but realised it may be a good opportunity to talk about this stuff, as it happens a lot, for a lot of books. I meant to write it back in may, but I got distracted by working myself to death. However, I appear to have a few minutes spare, and as there’s a lot of comics economics talk going around in the last few days, it strikes me as a good time to throw this into the mix.In August 2006, the month that our first issue of Phonogram launched, the Walking Dead’s sales figures were estimated at 20,501.I can tell you, this wasn’t a failure or a cause of concern. Every single creator envied Kirkman and Allard. In the same month, Invincible’s sales were estimated as 13,584. Maybe that was a cause for concern? It’s basically 2/3rds of Walking Dead. It’s well beneath the line Marvel would cancel a book.No, it wasn’t a cause for concern. Almost every Image Creator would have also killed for those numbers.Walking Dead then wasn’t what Walking Dead is now, but it was still the book which set the conversation in terms of what Indie books were capable of. That Kirkman had his name on two books with that level of success made him the go-to example of how to indie comics. No, I don’t mean “hey, you get to do your own thing and make some money.” I mean “you are doing financially better than you would by doing a WFH book for the big two.”I’ll give you some really basic rule of thumbs for indie comic commentary:Anything selling stably over 10k in single issues is a cause for celebration and joy. The creators are almost certainly extremely happy.If you’re selling over (ooh) 12k, you’re probably making more than either of the big two would pay you, unless you’re one of the very biggest names.If you’re selling anything near 20k, you probably have to buy drinks for your friends.And in a real way, if Phonogram settled around 6k back in 2006, I suspect Jamie and I would have settled into doing it for another 40 or 50 issues.There’s all manner of exceptions to the above, but if you look at the charts and bear that in mind, you’ll be closer to how the industry looks at those numbers.None of the above includes digital sales. None of the above include trades. You throw trades in, and you change everything entirely. A cursory look at hit indie comic numbers reveals that their trades sell much more than Marvel/DC main universe trades, with a few exceptions (There’s a reason why Matt and David’s Hawkeye was such a big thing, and it wasn’t its monthly sales). Let’s bold another sentence.You cannot do an industry commentary column on indie books without including  the impact of trades.There are books that are selling well beneath 10k and are doing just fine.All the three sentences I bolded in a block were about making  money from the single issues. They do not include any other revenue source, such as trades. If the single issues break even and you make your money in trades, that’s also fine. With a few exceptions, big two comics primarily make their money in single issues. That is one reason why their single issue sales matter so much more.There’s other reasons why single issue sales need to be higher…Overheads. They have more editors staff, etc. What a creator owned book makes, generally speaking, a creator owned book keeps. The overheads are lower.Profit targets. Books don’t just need to be profitable. They need to be profitable to a level which has been corporately pre-determined, in a set period of time. A relatively low selling book is taking the place of a book which could abstractly sell higher. Why keep a book which sells 18k on the shelf when you could have one which sells more?All those factors interacting are amongst the reasons why the bar is higher for a monthly audience at the big two.Equally, it would be a mistake to confuse the audience of a book with its monthly sales. As said above, you would have to include a trades for that, and the trades are not a small thing. On a personal level, we’ve sold over 50,000 copies of the first WicDiv Trade. Last I looked at Amazon’s stats we were selling about 1000 a month via book shops alone (i.e. not including comic shops, which is usually more.) The orders for 12 were 22k. The initial orders of the second trade are up 33% on the first trade. Realistically, we were hoping to stabilise at around 13k, and we’d have been enormously happy with that, even if we weren’t selling trades. Which we are. WicDiv is a ludicrous success, by far the biggest thing in our entire career. And thanks to everyone’s support in achieving that. The idea that there’s articles being written which try and frame discussion of indie comics like this - and it’s an approach which is picked up by comment threads - is entirely counter to the reality of the comics industry. " False link

It is revolting. It is cowardly. It is inexcusable. We must speak out against violence, against hated, and oppression.We need more than accountability and justice, we have a social responsibility to do what is right. To speak for those who can no longer speak for themselves.Remember Walter L. Scott. Remember Eric Garner. Remember Tamir Rice.In the immortal words of Martin Niemöller:“When the Nazis came for the communists,I remained silent;For I was not a communist.When they locked up the social democrats,I remained silent;For I was not a social democrat.When they came for the trade unionists,I did not speak out;For I was not a trade unionist.When they came for the Jews,I remained silent;For I wasn’t a Jew.And when they came for me,there was no one left to speak out.There was no-one left to speak for me”" True link

Everyone wants to talk about mental illness as quiet introverts drinking tea and nervously stuttering over words. No one ever talks about symptoms like paranoia or hallucinations or hypersexuality or compulsions or homelessness or drug addiction or delusions or psychosis or violent urges. Every time a clearly mentally ill person commits a crime, and someone says, “Hey, maybe this is a sign that we need to improve mental health awareness in this country,” everyone goes to screaming: “This isn’t about mental illness! Mentally ill people aren’t violent!”But yes, sometimes mentally ill people are violent. Sometimes we are bad people. And even those mentally ill people are in need of advocacy, maybe even more so.When you post “Protect people with mental illnesses at all costs,” do you mean all of us, or just the cute ones?"
