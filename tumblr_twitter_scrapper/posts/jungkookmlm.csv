How you do feel?  RAP MONSTER: “Already…! Physically it’s tiring but mentally I feel good. Whenever I hear the cheering of fans all over the world, I feel an unspeakable joy and delight. Thank you for letting me experience these feelings, and I hope the members and I will all be healthy for the rest of the tour.”   JUNGKOOK: “While touring, I get to make eye contact with a lot of fans, but the more I perform, the more I feel ‘I need to work really hard to become one with the fans’. And of course the fun is still forever the same. I have to develop my skills as well to show a more improved side of myself.” - This is your second tour, seems like you have relaxed a little bit more. Any newly-found joy of touring worldwide?  SUGA: “As the venue and the audience number gets bigger, I often think about the flow of the performance. Finding that flow is really fun.”  JIMIN: “The first tour went by too hectically so it left a lot of regrets. But this time I’m getting the feeling of ‘Concerts are fun’.”  - Compared to the first tour, the tour schedule has expanded drastically. Every country seems bring a distinctive vibe and feeling.  JIN: “There are people who just quietly listen to the songs and there are those who sing along too. But all the audience regardless of country enjoy our music and performances.”  J-HOPE: “Since North and South America fans can’t see us frequently, they reacted very passionately. They sing and dance along with us, we even receive more energy thanks to their excitement. We’re currently performing in South East Asia and the reactions are indeed very enthusiastic too.  - Is there any interesting episode during the tour?  J-HOPE: “I start enjoy eating local food in each country. But some are quite sensitive towards food so seems like I’m the only one eating it too deliciously, I feel sorry for that.”  V: “There will be soon. I’m thinking of making some funny episodes with the members. Please look forward to it!”   - In less than 4 years, many things have come true. How would you put it in short?  RAP MONSTER: “I worked really hard. It was such a spectacular 4 years that I seem to forget everything in the previous 20 years.”  SUGA: “It was 4 years of only looking forward and running. I worked so hard mindlessly.” - What does A.R.M.Y mean to BTS?  JIN: “A part of us. We can exist because there’s ARMY. We are nothing without ARMY.”  SUGA: “I’m happy that we give and receive positive influence from each other. As much as they gain strength from looking at us, we also gain strength by looking at them. Thank you for influencing us whenever we’re tired and exhausted.”  V: “ARMY is the reason why we can go perform around the world, the reason we work harder to show you guys everything of us.”  - Foreign artists that you want to collaborate with, or any artist you admire?  RAP MONSTER: “Drake, Nas, Tablo-hyungnim, Yoonha-noona, Lee Sora-sunbaenim.”  JIN: “I really like Coldplay. They’re so awesome, I don’t think to the extent of collaborating with them, I’m just supporting them from afar.”  SUGA: “I have many favorite artists. These days I listen to Flume quite a lot. It’d be fun if we collaborate.”  J-HOPE: “I want to try making a fun song with Tinashe.”  V: “I really like John Legend-sunbaenim. I’m an absolute, total, real fan. I like all of his songs but ‘Start’ is my ultimate favorite!”  JIMIN: “I’ll pick Ariana Grande.”  JUNGKOOK: “I want to try composing together with Justin Bieber and Charlie Puth. I also want to try making a song with the vibes of Radwimps’ ‘Date’.”  - BTS has a lot of songs with difficult choreography. What’s the song with the hardest choreography?  JIMIN: “My solo song ‘Lie’ is the hardest.”  JUNGKOOK: “For me it’s ‘Danger’.”  - If Bangtan Boy is no longer ‘boys’, what will your group name be?  JIN: “We’re always boys at heart, so we won’t change the group name.”  - If BTS members are not part of BTS right now, what would you be? And how will you be in 10 years?  RAP MONSTER: I would probably be a Business & Economics student. 10 years later when the waves* go by, I hope I can make music and perform with a more relaxed mind.”  (T/N: can be understood as ups and downs, or the surge of immaturity of the youth.)  SUGA: “If I weren’t part of BTS, I would be composing right now. 10 years later I’ll still be active as BTS.”   - We’ll be asking individual questions. Rap Monster, what is the hardest moment as a leader?  RAP MONSTER: “I think it’s when I need to work hard and take care of the parts that other members can’t see.”  - Suga, what’s your favorite hair color?  SUGA: “Black.”   - Jin, this has been a rising topic among fans, how do you manage your appearance?  JIN: “Using facial masks frequently, eating a lot of fruits, drinking water, also the self-esteem and confidence in my appearance and overall just handsomeness. These are the secrets to my perfect skin and appearance. Haha.”  - V, can you give some advice to timid and shy people on how to raise confidence?  V: “I want to tell them to think ahead of what will happen next and not be scared of it. I learned that if you continue to be timid and shy, then even things that are supposed to go well will not too. Fighting.”   - J-hope, why did you start dancing?  J-HOPE: “I started dancing because I simply just like music and expressing the music with my body. The decisive reason was that performance I had at my elementary school retreat’s talent show. It was when I felt the fun of music.”  - Jungkook, you always carry a big backpack whenever going on tour, what do you put in there?   JUNGKOOK: “I have to bring my bluetooth speaker.”  - Jimin, you have the potential to be a rapper, do you want to join the rapper line?  JIMIN: “Thank you but I have never thought of joining the rapper line. I think it’s impossible.”  - Let’s head back to common questions. I heard you release a new Japanese music video and album on the 10th. What’s your plan for the rest of the year?  J-HOPE: “My ultimate goal is to wrap up the tour successfully and show a cool side of myself.”  JIMIN: “We will not only be promoting the new album in Japan but also performing in several cities.”   - I remember you once said in an interview that you have been including “our stories” in your songs, but now you “want to include other people’s stories” as well. You mainly captured the emotions of the youth in their early 20s. Is there any emotion or song’s vibe that you want to try?  RAP MONSTER: “I haven’t been able to tell the stories about parents properly, hope one day I can write a song about that topic.”  V: “I want to personally compose and write lyrics for a song of my style that everyone can enjoy and have fun listening . I’m practicing diligently right now, please look forward to it.”  - A word to global fans and also readers of ‘SportsKhan’ for our 12th anniversary.  RAP MONSTER: “Thank you for always accompanying us. The glory we get belongs to everyone. We will move forward with a modest and grateful mindset. To all readers and ‘SportsKhan’ who are celebrating their 12th year anniversary, congratulations to everyone. Thank you and I love you.”  JIN: “Thank you for always staying with us. Like how your love makes us shine, we want to make you shine too. We’ll love you endlessly. Thank you.” SUGA: “Congratulations to ‘SportsKhan’ on your 12th anniversary.  will wrap up successfully so please look forward to it.”  J-HOPE: “Please love BTS a lot and to readers of ‘SportsKhan’, please keep an eyes on us in the future as well.”  V: “Thank you ARMY for adoring us, saying ‘I love you’ a lot to us, thank you for coming with us all the way here. We will work harder to show you cooler songs and performances. I love you too. Readers, if you eat too many ice creams because it’s hot, you’ll catch a cold. Please be careful of the fine dust. Have a great day everyone!”  JIMIN: “ARMYs, please always avoid catching a cold and take care of your health. Thank you for giving us the chance to deliver our news through an interview like this. I’m always grateful for your interest towards us. I hope all readers will be healthy and we’ll do our best in the future too.”   JUNGKOOK: “We’re working really hard right now. We’ll work even harder to give you strength even if it’s just a little bit. And to all readers, please love BTS a lot. You will have a lot of fun listening to our music!” " False text
