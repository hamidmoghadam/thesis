dailyniall 161059185337 "2017-05-25 14:58:11 GMT" http://dailyniall.tumblr.com/post/161059185337/billboard-niall-horan-braces-for-stardom-outside "When Niall Horan decided to move from London to Los Angeles in early 2016, it’s no surprise that he chose a house in Laurel Canyon, the epicenter of ’60s folk-rock culture. Horan was the one ­toting a guitar in One Direction, the British boy-band juggernaut that was just then going on a hiatus, and he’s got the soul of a singer-songwriter: He’s charismatic, witty and sensitive, but also easygoing and no-nonsense. Viewed alongside his bandmates – born rock star Harry Styles, “sensible one” Liam Payne, “funny one” Louis Tomlinson, moody R&B prince Zayn Malik – Horan, 23, is sort of like the middle brother: the most ­approachably handsome, the second-most popular across social media (29 million Twitter followers; 19 million on Instagram) and the most likely to lust after a gig at the historic Los Angeles rock club The Troubadour. “Playing for, like, 500 people. What more do you want?” says Horan. “I’ve had some good moments with screaming ­teenagers, but I like when the room is completely dead. It’s a ­different kind of respect. People are actually listening.”It’s exactly that reverent anticipation that greeted Horan when he played the ­opening notes of his first single, “This Town,” at the Los Angeles Jingle Ball near the end of 2016 – although when he strode into the spotlight, alone but for his guitar and this one little solo song, he was playing to an entire stadium (the Staples Center, to be exact). “This Town,” an acoustic coming-of-age tale that persuasively showed that the tweeny-bopper had grown up, would go on to hit No. 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 in January. “Slow Hands,” the next single off his planned 2017 solo album, is a throbbing, R&B-inflected rock tune that persuasively shows that he’s a grown-ass man, and it’s climbing the Mainstream Top 40 airplay chart at this very moment.But one Wednesday morning at the Laurel Canyon house, Horan seems ­positively boyish. He’s on the phone with his mom, for one. And he practically slides into the kitchen, wearing workout pants and a Nike shirt – a break from his typical uniform of topsiders, patterned socks, cuffed jeans and buttoned-up shirts. A nice lady named Ofelia brings us veggie omelets. “No pepper for you,” she chides Horan. “Acid reflux,” he explains.Horan’s fandom is thoroughly on display here. A framed black-and-white portrait of Frank Sinatra hangs in the den. The Rolling Stones lounge in full-color bacchanalian glory above the living room couch. Across from the fridge, Paul McCartney gazes up at a picture within that picture – Sinatra, again. Most of all, it’s the Eagles who occupy a place in Horan’s home. They get an entire wall: five photos lovingly hung outside his office.Ask Horan for a celeb story, and he’ll tell you about the time he met those very Eagles at a gig of theirs in Toronto. He’ll break out his Joe Walsh drawl to share a bit of wisdom from his favorite guitarist: “You better enjoy the ride, because one day you’re going to be sitting on your own balls.” Then he might add, far too ­casually, “Don Henley and I talk every couple weeks or so. It’s mad. I call him ‘Dad.’ He calls me ‘Son.’""In fact, says Horan, “Slow Hands,” co-written by Adele collaborator Tobias Jesso Jr., was inspired by Henley solo hits like “Boys of Summer” and “Dirty Laundry.” It’s almost as if he has retraced the evolution of two decades of California rock in his nearly 18 months outside of One Direction. Henley himself gives Horan a hearty endorsement: “Niall is a solid guy whose focus is right where it ought to be: on songwriting. He’s got the Irish charm and a healthy, self-effacing sense of humor, which is an essential ­survival tool in this business. I think that Niall will evolve into a resonant, thoughtful voice for his generation.”As a member of 1D – even the guy pegged as “the cute one” – Horan has a major leg-up on voice-of-a-generation status. Or at least, pop-star-of-a-generation status. After five years of working in lockstep with four (three, after Malik’s exit) other dudes – churning out an album a year, then touring to promote it while writing and recording the next one on the road – it’s now the mundane moments, away from the stage, where Horan feels a bit naked. “Every now and then you’re like, ‘Fookin’ hell, where is everyone?’ ” he says. “You’re sitting in an airport lounge, they call you for a plane, and you don’t stand up initially because you’re waiting on ­everyone else, you know? ‘Oh, Louis’ll be back from the toilet in a minute.’”When I first meet Horan – in the studio back in November, his first month ­recording his solo album, which is due on Capitol this fall – he’s his own toughest critic. “I have loads of songs, but now that I’ve heard what we’ve done, I realize the rest are shite,” he says. “Nothing I do will be as big as One Direction, but I have to try at least to get somewhere near it.” By late April, though, he tells me, “The songs are sounding really good,” and he’s itching to get out of the studio and play live (he’s currently got a few dates planned in June).“Niall’s got the stuff,” says Don Was, the producer and president of Blue Note, who worked on some potential album cuts with Horan. “He drove himself to the studio, carried his own guitar, stepped up to the microphone and was great every take. If they do the Desert Trip festival in 50 years, he’ll be headlining.”After 1D made its final appearance, at the Billboard Hollywood Party for the 2015 edition of Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve, Horan packed a rucksack, grabbed two of his cousins (and one chill security guard) and flew to Southeast Asia. The guys rented scooters wherever they went, ate whatever was around, shared rooms for $20 a night and bought ­same-day flights to get to whichever place was next. Horan “literally didn’t wear a shirt for three weeks” in Thailand, but in Bali “it pissed rain.” They learned about history in Vietnam and “got very drunk” in Hanoi. In Boracay, they got stuck at a bad motel – “lights flickering, cats drinking out the pool, spiders walking the wall, damp ­bedsheets, plus you’ve got the shits from the dodgy food” – and they loved it.“I didn’t want the schedule anymore,” says Horan. “I’ve spent so much time ­setting alarms on phones.” When 1D was still a going concern, he says, “all me mates were backpacking, while I wasn’t even allowed to go outside of the hotel.”In his newfound free time, Horan revisited stuff he had heard as a kid, relearned “how effective simple music can be” and cataloged his experiences in his leather-bound book of song ideas. Born of blue-collar Irish stock in tiny Mullingar, Ireland, he was the classic townie with a dream. His mom soldered ­pewter ware, Mullingar’s biggest export, and his dad worked nights behind the butcher counter at the Tesco ­supermarket (where 1D fans knew to find him until 2016, when he was, says Horan, “made ­redundant”). They divorced when Horan was 5, and he and his big brother moved in with their dad. Horan did his own laundry and cooking and got himself up each day to walk the mile-and-a-half to school. (“I didn’t need all the pampering,” he says.) He was also brought up on “the good stuff” – Crosby, Stills & Nash; Fleetwood Mac; Jackson Browne – and adopted his brother’s guitar, a neglected Christmas gift, at 12. He did talent shows and small gigs. These days, Horan’s getting hard-won wisdom direct from the source. “Bieber told me that you never really know when you’re finished” with an album, says Horan, who in addition to Was and Jesso has been working with songwriters Greg Kurstin (1D, Sia) and Jamie Scott (1D, Olly Murs), plus producers Jacquire King (Tom Waits, Kings of Leon) and Julian Bunetta (1D, Fifth Harmony). “He thought he was done [with Purpose] and then got ‘Love Yourself’ at the last minute. I thought my album was finished, and then I went on a bit of a run ’cause I was writin’ crap stuff up until then.” Although he does call “Flicker,” a pretty, strings-laden early track about the last night in a failing relationship, one of his favorites. “On the Loose,” a newer ­recording, reinvents Fleetwood Mac’s “Dreams” for the tropical-pop set.All his self-discovery aside, Horan remains close with his bandmates. “I see Louis and [his son] little Freddie all the time. He lives around the corner from me [in Los Angeles],” he says. He picked up gifts for Payne’s month-old boy that he hasn’t been able to present yet, because their ­schedules haven’t aligned. He planned to see Styles when the lanky star was in town for a ­weeklong residency on The Late Late Show With James Corden and genuinely gushes about his April episode of Saturday Night Live: “I loved his brilliant impression of Mick Jagger” in the Family Feud sketch, he says. As for his musical performances, he adds, “I really enjoyed them. He’s smashin’ it.”Horan even shrugs off Malik’s post-1D kvetching: “Oh, pfft. I know what Zayn’s like – outspoken, and fair play to him.” He offers the same civility to Simon Cowell, who ­publicly attacked Horan’s loyalty for ­choosing Capitol over his Syco label. (1D formed on The X Factor.) “We’ll always have mutual respect. When we get back to the band, he’ll be at the forefront again,” says Horan. And he’s certain they’ll be back: “When it will be, I don’t know. I ­prefer not to do it after I’m 40. I’d prefer the next few years.”Capitol chairman/CEO Steve Barnett, who signed 1D when he was at Columbia, says he has seen Horan grow from “a special little kid from a provincial island” to “the absolute top in terms of professionalism, thoughtfulness, work ethic and appreciating what he’s got. You’d be proud if he was your son.”Horan did pay his mom’s mortgage and tried to buy his dad a country home, although the old man refused. Was that awkward? “No, I love it,” says Horan, ­grinning. “I always say there’s ­ignorance and there’s Irish ignorance. It’s on a ­different level. He’ll barely take a Christmas present off me. He doesn’t want any of it. He just wants me to come visit.” Horan’s own home in Laurel Canyon – a five-bedroom, 4,400-square-foot house on a 9,600-square-foot lot, bought for $4 million – is modest for a guy in his tax bracket. And while he does have a trophy wall in it, you get the feeling it’s because he doesn’t buy knickknacks – just the ­occasional $20,000 guitar, like the 1961 Gibson ES-335 he toured with in December.In other words, it is almost freaky how free Horan seems to be of the post-­traumatic stress of young stardom. “Maybe it’s where I’m from,” he says. “I’m quite a simple old soul, me.” When in London, where he first moved when he was 16, Horan hangs out with his three cousins (one lives in the apartment he keeps there) and Irish buddies who’ve made their way to the city. In Los Angeles, he’s got his best friend since he was 4, who moved there for work, and ­socializes with Selena Gomez and her crew, because – if the rumors about he and Gomez are true – he’s the rare celebrity who stays on good terms with his famous exes. (“Selena is the ­perfect role model for young girls. It takes balls to go in front of the world and share your problems,” he says, referring to her public struggle with lupus.) He and Ellie Goulding, a ­confirmed ex, are close, too. “We always have a great laugh,” he says. Horan good-naturedly dismisses rumors that he’s dating Gomez BFF Courtney Barry, with whom he was ­spotted at Disneyland in April. He’s single and thinks he has been in love twice but, he says, “it could have been lust.” “I think I got a type, anyway,” he says. “Dark hair, dark eyes. Someone I can see as a friend. At the moment, I’m enjoying being 23. I only get one go at me 20s. I’d like to give it me best go.” All the same, “I’m happy to go home alone on a Saturday night, drink and watch football.”“I’m pretty nervous in front of other celebrities still, but he’s so calm and chill,” says Mendes, another close L.A. friend, who went over to Horan’s after last year’s American Music Awards and again to watch the Grammys. “We just started jamming out, and it didn’t feel like, ‘Oh, I’ve got to be good in front of him.’ It was complete fun, no ego, like the reason you play music in the first place.”Music is not Horan’s only passion. In 2015, he caddied for Irish golf champ Rory McIlroy (and fell, with the bag, in front of a TV camera). He’s geeky talking about his astronaut pal Shane Kimbrough, whom he met when 1D shot a video at Johnson Space Center in Houston and who regularly called Horan from the International Space Station when he was overhead. Horan watched sci-fi flicks like Interstellar so he could ask Kimbrough “if they got it right.” Back on earth, there’s no place Horan can ­completely escape his fame, ­including Mullingar. There’s a small shrine to him at the Greville Arms Hotel, a local ­landmark that also has a section devoted to James Joyce. “My dad gave them my BRIT Award,” says Horan. “I gave it to him to keep, and he gives it to a hotel.” And he has come to expect a string of fans knocking on his folks’ doors ­hoping for a photo op. He was dreading this when we first met last fall, before he traded his blond boy-band coif for his natural hue: respectable brown. Then, he had every reason to assume the Directioners would follow him anywhere, even back to his roots as he makes the sort of music their parents probably loved. When we catch up in the s­­pring, Horan is relieved to report his last trip to Ireland was fairly quiet. But looking ahead at the rest of 2017, he knows work will keep him away from all his homes: “I might as well not live anywhere – I’m busy all year.” Enjoying the ride, as Joe Walsh would surely point out.

It’s the second song he released since One Direction announced their hiatus in 2015. On “Slow Hands,” Horan takes a turn from the more reflective, slowed down “This Town” and goes for a more muted sound. Above a stomp-and-clap beat and muted guitar, Horan allows his lower register to showcase his more seductive side on the track which is reminiscent of early Aughts hits from Jack Johnson and John Mayer. Prior to his new single’s release, the singer discussed the track in an interview with Mikey Piff on Sirius XM Hits 1 on Wednesday. Horan told Piff that after listening to some of the material he had, he wanted to add a bit more grit, funk and heavier bass. At the time he was listening to late Seventies and early Eighties music, like Don Henley. “When he went solo in the early Eighties, he just kinda had this funky kind of feel to it – heavy bass, heavy guitar – so I just thought, ‘Let’s give this a crack,’” he said of making “Slow Hands.""Horan added that the song was off-the-cuff. ""I wanted it to be a little bit cheeky with the lyric,” he explained. “And we wrote this concept.” He said that it’s set in a bar and the song’s theme changes up stereotypical roles. “The first line is 'As long as we should take this back to my place’ – and usually that’s what the guy would say, but we flipped it that the girl would say that, and that’s what she said right to my face.”'Cause with the song, like before we even wrote lyrics, we had all this big track and it sounded kind of sexy,“ he continued. ""So we thought this concept would match the vibe of the song, and I think we might have been right.”" True text

You’ll be able to hear the full exclusive interview on Friday morning at 7am, but here are some of our favourite moments…  1. Everyone tells him his new ‘do makes him look more mature.  In case you didn’t notice, his beachy blonde locks are no more and in their place is a bountiful head of brunette hair. According to Niall his new look has received quite the reaction, with everyone telling him he looks more mature since binning the bleach.  2. He first heard Harry’s new song on the radio.  That’s right: Niall first listened to Harry Styles’ new song on the radio, just like the rest of us mere mortals. And he had a lot to say about it.  3. He swam with sharks in the Bahamas.  Really. After much deliberation (twenty minutes, to be precise) he took the literal plunge and swam with sharks. Ever wondered what a shark feels like? Wonder no more: “They feel like sandpaper… they’re all a bit sloppy. It’s a bit weird but yeah, they’re sharks and they’re still scary.” Sloppy sandpaper - got it. He also snorkeled and swam every day. In short, he’s a total water baby. He’s basically part merman. You heard it here first.  4. A One Direction email chain EXISTS!  Yup, the guys are all looped in on what is probably (definitely) the only email chain in the world that we’d happily be a part of. Do they sign off with a kiss? Do they have personalised signatures? Does any sneaky BCC’ing occur? WHAT DO THEY EMAIL ABOUT?! So many questions, so many of them (thankfully) answered.  5. He does a REALLY good Olly Murs impression.  We’re actually not entirely convinced Olly wasn’t sat in on the interview, that’s how good it is. Educate your ears, stat.  6. He’s also great at making prank callsMeet 'Dave’, Niall’s Londoner alter-ego. He does a surprisingly brilliant accent when Grimmy got Niall to phone Niall impersonator 'Liam’ - he even got the poor lad to sing the chorus of his song, This Town.7. A Shawn Mendes collab might be happening.  A Niall Horan and Shawn Mendes collab sounds pretty sweet, right? You’ll be happy to know that it’s not off the cards. When will it be happening exactly? He spilled the beans to Grimmy.  8. He wrote his favourite song while watching the footie.  He wrote his favourite song off the much-anticipated album while… sat on his sofa, watching a Man United game. We kid you not.  " True text

The song is ‘a sexy one’ with a 70s/80s vibe. Has a big riff/electronic guitar moment. Niall said it basically took on a life’s of its own. –Album is 50/50 split between uptempo and more stripped/guitar driven. – Regarding the new label, wanted a fresh start and to see a different side of the industry. He has freedom to work at his pace, but he also has great support/backing in large numbers. Having a lot of fun.   – Anticipates all the guys will tour their solo music and that it will take about a year. No timestamp on 1D reunion. When the call comes, he will be there. – Niall leaves it open that One Direction could possibly reunite as a trio after Dan wonders “what if one member decides not to return”. Says no one has discussed anything / no specific plans have been made. It’s too soon.  – Regarding Zayn rejoining the group, Niall said “the fans would love it” but reiterates that these conversations are just too premature. –  Group did not want to make Louis’ X Factor performance a media circus given the circumstances. Would have been cringy with pictures/PR. Kept things private. Highly emotional obviously. Said Louis was incredible. *sniff*  – SOTT is “very Harry”. He was listening to it before the podcast. Said Harry was genius on SNL. Very funny. His Jagger imitation was brilliant. – The guys are still connected/try to stay updated with everyone’s moves and new music.

Can be quite shy with the “odd butterflies”. – Promo through May/June/July. Eager to get back to work. Got all the time off he wanted.  – James Blunt is favorite Twitter profile.

Not only does the song have a funkier feel to it than his acoustic debut “This Town,” but Horan admits that there’s a pretty sexy vibe involved with it as well. “The whole song was pretty off-the-cuff. I wanted it to be a little bit cheeky with the lyric,” Horan told Hits 1’s Mikey Piff. “We wrote this concept about being in the bar. The first line of the song is ‘We should take this back to my place’ – usually that’s what the guy would say, but we flipped it that the girl would say that, and that’s what she said right to my face. With the song, before we even wrote lyrics, we had this big track and it sounded quite sexy. So we thought that this concept would match the vibe of the song, and I think we might have been right.” Horan also detailed his album creation process in the interview, saying that he wrote about 70 songs for his forthcoming LP, narrowing it down to about 16 for the final track list. Even with all of those tracks to choose from, he said “Slow Hands” was actually one of the last to be written.“I wrote this one, probably, in February. I just thought, 'You know what? I’m missing a bit of grit. Something a bit more funky, something with a bit heavier bass.’ That’s what I set out to do,” he explained. “And then I was listening to a lot of late '70s, early '80s people like Don Henley. When he went solo in the early '80s, he just had this funky kind of feel to it – heavy bass, heavy guitar. So I thought, 'Let’s give this a crack.’ And then it just kind of happened, within a few hours, it was brilliant.""Although Horan has yet to reveal the release date for his solo album, it shouldn’t be too long before fans at least find out when they can expect it. With just two more songs to be recorded – which he plans to do the weekend after the release of ""Slow Hands” – the album is in the final stages.As for whether his Irish roots will be presented on the album? Don’t worry, Horan promises there’s one track that even he “blew myself away with Irishness.” Between sexiness and Irishness, it sounds like Niall fans have a lot to look forward to." True text

One of the music industry’s biggest stars—the first artist to debut at No. 1 on Billboard’s Social 50 Chart with his single “This Town” late last year—the 23-year-old Irishman is crazy about the game. “Now that we’ve taken a break as a band,” he says of his mates with One Direction, “I’m an absolute golf geek.""Though Horan’s first love is music, his passion for all sports, especially golf, runs deep. ""It was around the time of Tiger’s domination, and I loved staying up late to watch,” he said. “The Masters is the one I remember most, especially that Tiger chip-in in 2005.""It was around that time Horan joined the local golf club in his hometown, Mullingar, with a few friends. He was hooked from the beginning. So much so that when later touring he would often sneak away for a round with bandmate Harry Styles.""My schedule has allowed me to get across to the Masters and Ryder Cup and enjoy some of the best golf events in the world firsthand,” Horan says. “I’ve also been able to play a lot more and get my handicap down to single figures."" It helps when you can lean on pals like Rory McIlroy for lessons. The four-time major winner grew up a couple of hours away in Northern Ireland, and the two have become good friends through the game, with Horan having caddied for McIlroy in the Masters’ annual Par-3 Contest in 2015.Horan is just as serious about giving back, too. Last year, he teamed up with Justin Rose and his wife, Kate, for a charity event and sent a signed guitar to Jason Day for auction at another function.Extending his generosity to those in need has been important to Horan throughout his career and he has been involved in a number of other charitable endeavors as well, which is why he’s being honored by Golf Digest with an Arnie Award. ""I appreciate how lucky I am to be in this position,” said Horan, who helped raise nearly a million pounds for Cancer Research UK Kids & Teens and the Kate and Justin Rose Foundation designed to fight childhood hunger in the United States. “From the very start of the band, we’ve all made an effort to give back as much as we could.” Next on the radar: the Masters Tournament Foundation, which invests in development programs for golf.He’s not stopping there, either. Horan has also launched Modest! Golf Management, a boutique representation agency focused on the game’s rising young talent.“I wanted to get into supporting the next generation of golfers, and obviously I feel myself and my management company, who have a long history of looking after clients and all their needs from schedule planning to corporate deals, are very well placed to do this,” he says.“We brought in Mark McDonnell and Ian Watts, who between them have 30 years’ experience in the golf industry, to assist us.""Already, they’ve signed two-time South African amateur champion Thriston Lawrence and Italian standout Guido Migliozzi, and hope to add about 10 more players to their stable.""It’s a fun way to get more connected to golf,” Horan says. “I feel like my time growing up in the spotlight, with all the contracts we signed as a band and the media stuff we dealt with, I can help these young guys.”" True text

To commemorate the occasion, we decided to get all literary on yo asses, and composed five - yes FIVE - poems, all paying tribute to Nialler in glasses.

Being a big 1D  fan, Molly wanted to meet her ultimate hero, who her mum Lisa says has helped her through the intensive year of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy which she’s had since her diagnosis in March 2014.   Nialler in the flesh wasn’t the only prezzier for Molly either as, after her story spread across the fandom, around 500 fans held up signs saying ‘Molly is our Girl Almighty’ during the set, and the boys even gave her a shout out to dedicate the song to her amazing bravery.You might also remember her SUPER cute reaction to his original video message, but if you thought that was adorable then just wait til you see them both taking selfies together.

Safe trip home.”He also posted pictures with PSG’s David Luiz calling the former Chelsea defender ‘the funniest man in football’.One Direction are currently on a tour of the US and Canada playing 23 dates and also caught United’s friendly with Club America in Seattle a fortnight ago.At the time, Louis Van Gaal hit out at the state of the pitch at the CenturyLink Field in Seattle, after the band played a concert there two days before.He said: “Old Trafford is used for football only, not One Direction concerts.""Here its used for entertainment things. The facilities generally are fantastic. They could not be better.""But we have to play football on such a pitch. We could not do that and that’s important.”" True link

No, it  wasn’t the name of the new One Direction single. No it wasn’t that he’s  decided to hold open auditions for a wife. No it wasn- OH FOR GOD’S SAKE  STOP GUESSING SO WE CAN TELL YOU ALREADY. Sorry, we didn’t mean to shout. No don’t cry. Look you’ll like this story, honest. OK,  so yeah - Niall shared some exciting news, revealing that he can now  officially TOUCH HIS OWN BUM WITH HIS FOOT AGAIN after some pretty hefty  knee surgery last year. First  time I’ve been able to touch my arse with my heel since I got the  operation. Sounds so dumb, but it’s a big day in my head haahah! Oh, just imagine the squishy goodness. Anyway, this inspired us to take a  look at all things Horan bum-related, because clearly nothing else  could be more important. We like to call it ‘10 things we know about Niall Horan’s arse’ and it’s what journalism was MADE FOR.Are you ready for this?1.  Niall was once told that his rump was too 'squidgy’ for a tattoo.  Speaking about the time he decided to get a 'Made in Ireland’ inking on  his bum cheek, Goldilocks said: “They said the skin on your arse is too  squidgy. It needs to be tight. I suspect they did me a favour. It wasn’t  the best idea in the world.”2. The 'I love SC’  MYSTERY. Despite this, Niall claimed to have found a tattoo artist brave  enough to tackle the squidge - in order to ink 'I love SC’ on his  behind.Keep Reading" True link
