It’s possible to be both conservative and responsible, but those things aren’t related, much less the same. And it’s way less likely than being liberal and responsible. The only financially responsible presidential administrations we have had in decades have been “fiscally liberal.” One even got us to surplus, but Dubya ACTUALLY CAMPAIGNED on ending the surplus so that the Republican Congress would have the “discipline” to cut spending. (Surprise! They didn’t.) Yet still, here we are, in the age of Trump and his proposed EIGHT TRILLION DOLLAR MAGICAL PROFITS BUDGET, and moderately informed people say “well we might expect a deficit increase from democrats but–” NO.

People often use it that way, but this makes no sense. Fiscal conservatism is only a way of prioritizing spending, nothing more or less, and it irresponsibly and deliberately explodes the deficit. It refers to reducing spending on the poor and underserved, and cutting taxes on corporations and the wealthy, both as a moral obligation and ostensibly as a way of spurring growth. For growth, it generally only works in a tightly controlled economy, and even then only on the rare occasion where taxes are extremely high. In other words, not the US. As a moral matter, it’s clearly debatable–what most conservatives think of as tough love is simply cruelty and selfishness. “Fiscally responsible” is entirely different. For example, it is often cheaper to house homeless people than it is not to, but it requires setting up an involved and difficult program. It requires work and planning, and it sets people up for potentially changing their position in society. This is financially responsible but it’s distinctly and clearly NOT conservative. Another glaring example is Obamacare. It slowed private and government spending but lowered profits for some companies, helped those who couldn’t afford a doctor, and set up new government agencies. It saves money by assisting people when they need it instead of after they do. It allows people to keep working, keep their homes. Again, fiscally responsible, and maybe even considered acceptable to conservatives thirty years ago, but clearly not under today’s definition. Liberal and conservative policies could both potentially be cost neutral with effort, but at the federal level, ONLY fiscal liberals balance budgets or cut deficits. Fiscally responsible conservatism hasn’t existed in this country for decades, and it is long past time that we all acknowledge that. It isn’t just wrong to equate fiscally conservative with fiscally responsible, it is is false propaganda. There’s nothing moral or responsible about conservatism. It exists solely to maintain or increase the power of the ruling class. Allowing that there are “good” conservatives or a desirable version of that philosophy is to embrace the tight control of a white wealthy patriarchy. When people call themselves “socially liberal but fiscally conservative,” as my fellow white people often do, it technically means that they support the idea of class mobility for select people, but want government spending ordered to keep it from happening. If today’s debate on repealing the ACA shows us anything, it should be this: Unless reinforcing the status of the powerful is your goal, there is no conservatism, whether fiscal, social or other, that is remotely positive or remotely responsible. Do not forget it." True text

It’s related to an “active measure” that was pushed by RT, Sputnik and Trump, that the election would be rigged. It wasn’t, and calling it “hacked” makes it sound like it was. It implies that votes in the machines were changed. That’s not the issue, and it’s not helpful in understanding what happened.The issue here is not simply that Russia wanted Trump to win. That’s obvious, but no surprise or even a big deal. Putin has long despised Hillary Clinton, and she has been tough on Russia for years.There are three serious Trump/Russia problems that need our focus. Each one of them is an impeachable offense on its own. Even before taking them all together, we are looking at scandals that eclipse any seen from any previous presidency.Problem 1: The “hack” itself.There was in fact a hack by agents for Russia, as we all know, to steal DNC and RNC emails. If Trump received those files, which appears to be the case, this is a violation of the law.First of all, accepting material help or donations from foreign nationals in a political campaign is illegal. We know Trump illegally fundraised internationally during campaign. Foreign officials routinely complained about receiving the requests and published them online.Second, stealing files for political use, as Nixon learned, is also illegal. Trump’s campaign clearly coordinated with Russian agents such as Guccifer 2.0–now known to be several Russians, Wikileaks–Assange has long sought to create a “counter” to US power, and others, in leaking the DNC emails (the hacked RNC emails have remained hidden). Trump officials knew what these groups had before they released them, when they were coming out, and alerted media to their contents every time. While this is similar to the Watergate scandal, this is actually much, much worse. His supporters are trying to claim that this release of documents by Russia proves nothing, but the campaign’s direct involvement in their release, and Trump’s public “sarcastic” request for the hack is criminal.Problem 2: The payoff to Russia.We don’t know exactly what Russia is getting in return for their efforts. We do know of two public benefits already: Hillary Clinton was a strong Putin critic, and Trump is an unabashed Putin fan, so naturally Putin preferred candidate Trump. Russia was also keenly interested in sowing doubt about the fairness of democratic elections, especially in the US, and has succeeded wildly in that effort. As noted above, Trump was calling the election “rigged,” just like Russian media, well before the vote took place.We also know that Team Trump’s ONLY input in the Republican Platform before the GOP conventions was to change the language regarding Russia and the Ukraine. The Trump campaign revised the language in the platform to remove the pledge to arm the Ukraine in order to protect it from Russia. Cruz supporters and other Republicans had previously fought to increase Russian sanctions due to their moves against the Ukraine, but Trump’s team gutted that part.We also know that Trump’s National Security Advisor, Gen. Michael Flynn, was a paid foreign agent for Turkey, and was also receiving payments from Russia. The Foreign Agent Registration Act (originally an anti-Nazi measure) has very rigorous disclosure requirements that Flynn and the Trump campaign completely ignored.We also know that Paul Manafort, campaign manager at the time, and longtime Trump friend (and neighbor in Trump Tower), was a paid lobbyist for the pro-Russian Ukrainian president for over a decade. In fact, the whole “lock her up” chant that was–and is still–so popular at Trump rallies was first used by Manafort in Yanukovich’s campaign. (And Yulia Tymoshenko was indeed locked up.)Putin has already gotten an excellent deal from the Trump Administration in return for his support, but we do not know what is still remaining. As Putin cracks down on dissent across Russia, and his language mirrors that of Trump in terms of “paid protesters,” we can only guess what their collaboration might mean for American democracy. As they both push for “traditional” anti-gay, anti-woman, anti-brown-immigrant nominally-Christian white supremacy to consolidate their power, their place in the global fascist movement is becoming more and more prominent.Problem 3: The payoff to Trump.Donald Trump has been trying to do business in the Soviet Union and Russia since at least 1987, and by many accounts has been groomed as an asset for decades. The possibilities for mind-boggling profits for the well-connected are tremendous in Russia since the Soviet Union’s fall. For associates of Putin, as long as they stay in line, this has been the norm.We have no reason to assume that Trump isn’t shifting US policy in Russia’s favor in exchange for money or deals. In fact, with his Russian government and Russian mob ties, it seems more likely than not. A highly-connected American asset could make millions, if not billions, of dollars from Russian deals.We know that many operations of the Russian mafia in New York operated out of Trump Tower; this is why the FBI was monitoring the building and apparently picked up some of Trump’s communications. While Trump claimed that he himself was “tapped,” the FBI has stated that some of his communications might have been picked up in their surveillance of known criminals.This isn’t much different than how Lindsey Graham, Jared Kushner and other Trump associates’ conversations were picked up while speaking with the Russian Ambassador, who was being surveilled as a suspected spy recruiter.The closeness of Trump’s Administration to Putin and Russian associates, his business ties to wealthy Russian oligarchs, Russian banks and Russian mob leaders, his placement of family loyalists Jared Kushner and his daughter Ivanka into the White House itself, all appear to be a setup for Trump Organization profits. As Republicans in Congress continue to rebuff calls for Trump’s financial and tax information, it is difficult to imagine that Donald Trump isn’t selling our country’s policy to line his own pockets.In fact, based on everything we have known about Trump for the past thirty years, it is extremely likely.(you can watch the hearings again here) Update: I may have spoken too soon. The issue, in my view, was always that Russia’s interference in the election is where the illegality lies. I still think that’s the case, and it’s where investigators seem to be focusing.But now it seems that the first paragraphs of this post may be incorrect.Problem 4. The Justice Department has confirmed that there are 90 pages of swing state machine flaws from November, in a FOIA answer to navo-us.org. In addition, we know of Russian hacking into state elections boards before the election occurred, but it’s not clear how this might have been used. Again, this may all be more of the active measures designed to reduce our confidence in democracy, but it’s hard to know without all the facts. It still seems that the likely sale of US policy in order to line our current President’s pockets is the more pressing issue." False text

If they don’t work things out, my inclination has been that Trump will stand by his son-in-law. It’s widely seen in the real estate industry that he hasn’t been able to manage his businesses without his kids for years, and let’s face it, the presidency is just another business to him. Don’t cross family, no matter who you think you are, because Trump cannot work without them. They are literally the only people he can trust. On the other hand, if Trump dumps Bannon in favor of Kushner, he’ll lose his base of support. The Nazi alt-right and the rest of his bigoted die-hards worship the guy, and are already up in arms about Trump’s Jewish son-in-law being in the White House. While that sounds like an opportunity to pick up moderate support, Trump’s approval is so low that it’s unlikely he can. Without his appeal to ethnonationalism (and I count Republicans like Mitch McConnell and Steve King in this group), Trump has almost no supporters at all. This is a loud and aggressive group that comes with its own grassroots operations, and he can’t afford to dismiss them. His only choice is to make them get along. He’ll stick to the only path he can." True text

I don’t like being around it and needed to be comfortable in an urban environment where I didn’t have to encounter it daily. Basically, I don’t believe less wealthy members of society should grovel before their social betters. That way of thinking goes back hundreds of years, obviously. When most parts of the US adopted the Dutch word “baas” into a new American term more suitable for a democracy, the English “master” stayed in use in the South, as a tattered aristocracy worked for centuries to create and enforce a more violent form of England’s class system throughout the region. Here, “boss” came to refer to the lower-class enforcer who reported to the master himself. While that has obviously changed over time–though relatively recently–the pedestal that the master occupies, the gratitude common people are expected to show for their benevolence, has not. It’s not unique to this region of course. I’ve run across it in entitled and libertarian regions in the northeast and seen it elsewhere, too. But it’s only in the South where I’ve witnessed it continually embraced outside rural areas, by the very people that it so effectively undermines. The idea of the commonwealth, of something for all citizens, is as foreign to this region as the Russian language. Here, we look to our corporate leaders and wealthy families for table crumbs, for protection & entertainment, and for permission to act. This flies in the face of our popular ideas of the smartass rebel, glorified by the Dukes of Hazzard and other tv shows and movies. But it makes sense once it’s understood that the smartass rebel is a marginal character here, much more likely to end his life as Cool Hand Luke than Bo Duke, muttering alone in his shack if not prison itself. As celebrated as the lawbreaking bootleggers still are, they exist outside the mainstream, with their romanticization from the ruling class little different than memories of childhood squirrel hunts and canned sardine lunches. The mainstream is obedient, deferent and possesses a mixture of awe, gratitude and fear toward the fabulously wealthy that is painfully embarrassing to behold. Watch one of our Congressmen apologize to BP executives for the Katrina disaster if you want to scratch the surface of the worshipfulness that is expected here. I know, I know. I’m describing something that exists all across the nation in many ways. This is certainly not limited to the South, just like racism is not, and I’m not someone who claims the South is full of more bad people than elsewhere. But here, this idea of a fixed class permeates in ways that are more difficult to escape, with struggling workers admiring the charity of the Walton family, or arguing that development companies should be given free rein to foul their own water. Today they’re arguing that they don’t need health insurance, that they (I suppose) will just wither and die once it’s clear that the church bake sale can’t pay for their future lung cancer treatments, because they know that they’re lower class and don’t deserve anything more. Perhaps one of their libertarian heroes of finance will step in and personally intervene like God himself, but if they do not, His will is being done. Passions flare over this in no small part because of race. A rigid class structure maintains the illusion of permanent white dominance, and masks the prevalent white working class fear of slipping to an even lower rung in society. Control is the most important issue for the whites I know who fear changes in racial status (or its loss) and the “tradition” of conservative subservience is the path for keeping it. The adoration of the financially successful reinforces it. The election of a highly-educated black president shattered it. In fact, as with Bill Clinton, his humble origins are the most distressing part of his biography here. If he were born into a wealthy black family, perhaps with a slaveholding ancestry, or even someone who slipped comfortably into a CEO role (like Herman Cain, subservient to the Koch brothers), President Obama’s election may have been easier to accept. But he wasn’t like either of those things. Barack Obama leapt over many people in his ambitions, drive and focus, and argues for making his path easier to follow, as liberals tend to do. He’s an inspiring figure for anyone inclined to be inspired. He doesn’t claim that his success comes only from his work and ambition, even while that is clearly a major part of his story. But for those who rely upon inequality and fixed social classes in order to maintain the facade that they aren’t the poorest citizens of this country, his biography destroys everything they thought they knew about the world. Personal responsibility is an easy concept to rattle on and on about, especially when born with privilege (whether that privilege is perceived or real). But real personal responsibility, taking on the efforts of improving your station in life, bettering your social position, supporting your network of friends and making your community a better place to live, is difficult, and it often takes a large amount of luck and good timing. Democrats continue to make this point, and Obama’s election made it powerfully clear. The self-protective response for someone who subconsciously wants nothing to change, or—as is most often the case—doesn’t know that things have already changed without them, is to declare that President Obama must have cheated. Barring that, he must be in support of a foreign system such as “communism,” a popular accusation against striving minorities or supporters of workers’ rights for at least sixty years. (Incidentally the “communism” claims share similarities with gleeful reports of naming–and hanging–“black Republicans” over a century ago.) So here we are today, listening to cries of “communism” again, as a loud minority in the Republican Party shuts down our government in order to re-legislate a funded and operating law. This is an attempted coup. Not to remove us from democracy, but to reintroduce an earlier version of it. The Representatives that have planned out and deliberately plunged the nation into this unnecessary crisis are operating from a position of entitlement and thirst for a strong ruling class (as opposed to a strong government for all citizens) that served as the basis for the Articles of Confederation. Real democracy, for this group, is as terrifying as progress. Voter suppression is not perceived by them as “suppression,” but limiting the right to those who will reinforce our “American” class structure. Income inequality is not a danger, but a net positive because it fixes the heirarchy in place. A government led by a ruling class tightly tied to corporate structures is not seen as fascist, but as a strong government  that can enforce historical (read: misogynistic, racist and intolerant) values upon a society that is working hard to shed them, which it would certainly do. I’m tired of it, frankly, but it helps to remember that we have arrived here due to competing visions of American democracy that were written into our Constitution. Fortunately, the sections enforcing slavery, the ones that were necessary to make the visions of godlike masters and a fixed class structure actually work, have been repealed. Fortunately our society is slowly continuing to move toward more representation and freedom of traditionally oppressed groups, even as our government claims more authority to observe us every day and partners with corporations to do so. It has taken wars, violence and much ongoing effort to keep this country together and define its direction since its founding, and the Republican ransom note we’re seeing this week is another small part of that struggle. My hope is that we will someday see this week as a blip along the way toward a better union, but we must recognize that the small number of Congressmen that have deliberately put this plan into action despite public disapproval have done so in order to reverse course. This is not a simple disagreement over where a few dollars may go, it is a planned-out attempt to micromanage the spending process in order to eliminate necessary, effective and popular chunks of governmental responsibility, support and oversight. A fixed ruling class with established corporate support are an effective method of countering the messy nature of open democracy, by constantly limiting the power of ordinary people. We must keep in mind that this is ultimately what is at stake here, and if this anti-government faction can force the shutdown to remain in place until Democrats and mainstream Republicans give in and allow piecemeal funding approvals, we will witness the beginning of a new era of corporate and elite control, one based upon the expected subservience and adulation of the old Confederacy. Reblogging myself here, not because I was right, but because I missed a lot of things in this post that Trump’s election has since made clear.  Notably, the desire for authoritarianism is greater throughout the country than I understood at the time. It may be slightly more ingrained into southern cultural institutions but it is a prominent feature of American politics, and it won the last election." False text

Not only did it have a softer connotation than “imprisoned” or “captured,” but it was part of a Bush strategy to claim that detainees were not technically POW’s and thus not subject to Geneva Convention protections, and could be tortured.

Even before taking them all together, we are looking at scandals that eclipse any seen from any previous presidency.Problem 1: The “hack” itself.There was in fact a hack by agents for Russia, as we all know, to steal DNC and RNC emails. If Trump received those files, which appears to be the case, this is a violation of the law.First of all, accepting material help or donations from foreign nationals in a political campaign is illegal. We know Trump illegally fundraised internationally during campaign. Foreign officials routinely complained about receiving the requests and published them online.Second, stealing files for political use, as Nixon learned, is also illegal. Trump’s campaign clearly coordinated with Russian agents such as Guccifer 2.0–now known to be several Russians, Wikileaks–Assange has long sought to create a “counter” to US power, and others, in leaking the DNC emails (the hacked RNC emails have remained hidden). Trump officials knew what these groups had before they released them, when they were coming out, and alerted media to their contents every time. While this is similar to the Watergate scandal, this is actually much, much worse. His supporters are trying to claim that this release of documents by Russia proves nothing, but the campaign’s direct involvement in their release, and Trump’s public “sarcastic” request for the hack is criminal.Problem 2: The payoff to Russia.We don’t know exactly what Russia is getting in return for their efforts. We do know of two public benefits already: Hillary Clinton was a strong Putin critic, and Trump is an unabashed Putin fan, so naturally Putin preferred candidate Trump. Russia was also keenly interested in sowing doubt about the fairness of democratic elections, especially in the US, and has succeeded wildly in that effort. As noted above, Trump was calling the election “rigged,” just like Russian media, well before the vote took place.We also know that Team Trump’s ONLY input in the Republican Platform before the GOP conventions was to change the language regarding Russia and the Ukraine. The Trump campaign revised the language in the platform to remove the pledge to arm the Ukraine in order to protect it from Russia. Cruz supporters and other Republicans had previously fought to increase Russian sanctions due to their moves against the Ukraine, but Trump’s team gutted that part.We also know that Trump’s National Security Advisor, Gen. Michael Flynn, was a paid foreign agent for Turkey, and was also receiving payments from Russia. The Foreign Agent Registration Act (originally an anti-Nazi measure) has very rigorous disclosure requirements that Flynn and the Trump campaign completely ignored.We also know that Paul Manafort, campaign manager at the time, and longtime Trump friend (and neighbor in Trump Tower), was a paid lobbyist for the pro-Russian Ukrainian president for over a decade. In fact, the whole “lock her up” chant that was–and is still–so popular at Trump rallies was first used by Manafort in Yanukovich’s campaign. (And Yulia Tymoshenko was indeed locked up.)Putin has already gotten an excellent deal from the Trump Administration in return for his support, but we do not know what is still remaining. As Putin cracks down on dissent across Russia, and his language mirrors that of Trump in terms of “paid protesters,” we can only guess what their collaboration might mean for American democracy. As they both push for “traditional” anti-gay, anti-woman, anti-brown-immigrant nominally-Christian white supremacy to consolidate their power, their place in the global fascist movement is becoming more and more prominent.Problem 3: The payoff to Trump.Donald Trump has been trying to do business in the Soviet Union and Russia since at least 1987, and by many accounts has been groomed as an asset for decades. The possibilities for mind-boggling profits for the well-connected are tremendous in Russia since the Soviet Union’s fall. For associates of Putin, as long as they stay in line, this has been the norm.We have no reason to assume that Trump isn’t shifting US policy in Russia’s favor in exchange for money or deals. In fact, with his Russian government and Russian mob ties, it seems more likely than not. A highly-connected American asset could make millions, if not billions, of dollars from Russian deals.We know that many operations of the Russian mafia in New York operated out of Trump Tower; this is why the FBI was monitoring the building and apparently picked up some of Trump’s communications. While Trump claimed that he himself was “tapped,” the FBI has stated that some of his communications might have been picked up in their surveillance of known criminals.This isn’t much different than how Lindsey Graham, Jared Kushner and other Trump associates’ conversations were picked up while speaking with the Russian Ambassador, who was being surveilled as a suspected spy recruiter.The closeness of Trump’s Administration to Putin and Russian associates, his business ties to wealthy Russian oligarchs, Russian banks and Russian mob leaders, his placement of family loyalists Jared Kushner and his daughter Ivanka into the White House itself, all appear to be a setup for Trump Organization profits. As Republicans in Congress continue to rebuff calls for Trump’s financial and tax information, it is difficult to imagine that Donald Trump isn’t selling our country’s policy to line his own pockets.In fact, based on everything we have known about Trump for the past thirty years, it is extremely likely.(you can watch the hearings again here)" True text

At the conclusion of the war, Mississippi was one of two Southern states that suddenly had a majority-black citizenry. As a result, the people there elected impressively integrated governments statewide, and were the first to send an African-American senator to Washington. The US troops stationed throughout the South to keep the peace during Reconstruction were under constant pressure by former Confederates and race terrorists. Public pressure from the North eventually led them to be called home, ending Reconstruction and allowing white supremacists to regain control. In Mississippi, black and liberal office holders were forcibly removed from the statehouse, and the old white power structure regained control. The state flag was changed to commemorate the occasion and was raised to serve as a warning to blacks and their allies that they were not welcome in elected office or in voting booths, and that any attempt to exercise their rights would be met with violence or death. The flag’s meaning has never changed." True link

We cannot understand the destructive nature of the Trump Presidency without stepping back and looking at how it fits within our history, and our country’s recurring violent reactions against the enfranchisement of new groups.Paramilitary groups such as the Ku Klux Klan were directly connected not only to Confederate army units, but also to antebellum militia companies and slave patrols, and thus to the means by which–along with elections and political patronage–slaveholders and large landholders established their dominance in the South. It was a sprawling universe of political activity in which democratic and violent methods were intimately linked and simultaneously practiced.The linkage and the simultaneity were not confined to the South. Before the Civil War, American politics saw the expansion of democracy and the birth of mass parties to an extent unknown in the Atlantic world. But it also saw a range of explosive terror-laden encounters–wars against Indians, anti-abolitionist mobs, nativist riots, police actions against fugitive slaves. The war itself serves as a classic example of Clausewitz’s notion of “politics by other means,” and in the postwar era, as the industrial revolution intensified, the new bourgeoisie and its political representatives moved to curtail popular democracy and arm themselves against what they saw as a growing working-class threat.Beginning in the 1870s and 1880s, efforts were made to reduce the number of elective offices, gerrymander election districts, toughen voter-registration requirements, and impose literacy tests–especially as working-class political movements, some associated with the Knights of Labor or the Greenback Labor Party, successfully contested for power. At the same time, armories were built, urban police forces were modernized, national guards were formed, and private armies were established. American labor history of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was probably more strike-ridden and violence-prone than anywhere else in the Western world, and soon after The Birth of a Nation (which might be regarded as the popular celebration of redemption) premiered to rave reviews, including from President Woodrow Wilson, the Ku Klux Klan was reborn. By the early 1920s, the Klan, combining intimidation and vigilantism with racism, anti-Semitism, and anti-Catholicism, had developed an immense national following, even among the powerful and the well-placed.The twentieth-century examples of political terror can easily be multiplied. Many are well known. But the point is not to suggest that somehow terror and violence overshadow democratic means in American politics. Not at all. It is rather to insist that terror and democracy have struggled in a complex embrace throughout our history, that they cannot be readily disentangled, and that their very interdependence marks the limits and the contradictions of our political process.Political democracy has thrived in America, and its expansion has proceeded most peacefully, when the universe of potential participants was relatively homogenous as to class, gender, ethnicity, and race, and when those who would confound this universe were excluded by a mix of law, custom, and force. When the excluded sought inclusion, they often met with stiff and obdurate resistance: think of the rejection of suffrage for blacks and women in the North in the 1840s and 1850s, or the Know-Nothing attack on immigrants’ rights around the same time. It usually required a national convulsion–the Civil War, World War I, and then World War II–to open the political gates, and even then the question of genuine empowerment posed challenges that established interests usually found difficult, if not impossible, to accept.Not surprisingly, with the exception of a “golden age” between the 1930s and the 1970s, America’s working classes, composed heavily of ethnic and racial minorities, have often stood in problematic relation to civil and political society. And when they have tried to flex their political muscle, either through electoral means or at the workplace, they have frequently provoked the hard fist of authority. This is the United States’ eternal struggle. As a nation created by its powerful moneyed interests, the upheaval of our revolution cast off a foreign king but left the working power structure in place. The Constitution, at its most basic level, simply created a power-sharing arrangement between the major politically-involved landowners, with only their white male land-owning peers allowed any vote. The lofty statements of the founders stood in contrast to the actual system they established, and that contradiction has been the source of conflict throughout our history. Our current iteration of white-nationalist make-America-great-again nostalgia is only the recent end of a long line of conservative thinking stretching back to the nation’s founding. While the players, the parties, and their roles have changed, American conservatism and American liberalism have clashed in much the same way since well before the Civil War. What we’ve seen is that conservatism’s protection of the ruling class in America has come to mean protection of white men at the expense of others, in addition to its more general protection of “tradition,” more strongly perhaps than in many other places. While many people today still question poor white Americans’ propensity to vote against their financial interests, this group is only doing what it has done since the nation’s founding: voting against the “other,” the immigrants, the freedmen, the radical women, the egalitarians. And if they lose those votes they turn to violence and suppression to enforce their will. This is a centuries-long practice that has to be seen as such.As the review notes above, this is not a Southern problem or a Northern problem, although its results have been different in different regions of the country. This is an American problem, one that the distinct differences between Barack Obama and Donald Trump–their style, their race, their rise to power, their attitudes and their polices– illuminate. Donald Trump isn’t normal, but he isn’t actually new, either. Look back to Reconstruction and the raising of the Confederate flag over the Mississippi statehouse in terroristic defiance of the majority. Look at the support for the Klan’s efforts in Wilson’s White House and in Tammany Hall. This conflict between the supporters of Trump and those appalled by his corruption and graft isn’t new here. In fact, it has arguably been the primary driver of American politics for over 200 years. We are in the middle of another one of our nation’s dangerous radical reactions to the expansion of democracy. Hold on tight, because if the previous ones are any guide, things are going to get much uglier before this new growth is accepted." True link

At my last job, we always had several clients who were billionaires. For the most part, we worked with large and small corporations, regional authorities and city leaders, or scrappy developers, but billionaires who led their own private companies hired us as well. All of these different client types had their unique features and challenges, but the “crazy billionaires,” as we called them, stood out for one main reason. They tended to be an irrational pain in the ass, first of all, but as a group they generally knew only one way of negotiating, and that was to threaten with firing, lawsuits or nonpayment. Making money with these clients was difficult, since they weren’t tied to ROI’s or schedules that were enforced by a board or management, and instead they operated on their own whims. They’d change their minds out of the blue, screw up everyone’s schedules and refuse to pay for additional work. Typically a cadre of yes-men existed only to repeat or enforce the boss’s wishes. “This work is not complete and we refuse to pay you,” they’d say, for example. We would ask for a list of what was missing, and receive threats along with a list of items outside our contract. This didn’t happen with large companies or government agencies, but was generally expected with the extremely wealthy. This tendency was multiplied if the billionaire in question inherited his wealth or made his money at a very young age. (In my personal experience so far it has always been a “he.”) That was brought home most clearly to me when a specific client decided he could not move forward with our agreement as long as we had an advance payment held in escrow. He literally had no idea how to work with our company unless he held all of the power. With that previously-negotiated money sitting in a bank account, his organization couldn’t force us to do extra work under threat of non-payment and was paralyzed by the prospect.  It didn’t matter that our fee was a tiny part of the overall endeavor, only that the man at the top had to be in a position to push us around. That balance of power is what killed the project. Without absolute leverage, the owner could not understand how to work with us. He was profitable in his ventures because his wealth gave him power. With that power diminished he would rather take a loss and walk away. I see Trump exactly the same way. He has no idea how to negotiate, but honestly believes that he does. Since he has always, as the purchaser with massive buying power and an army of lawyers, used threats to get his way, he thinks he’s a negotiator. He’s not. He’s just an aggressive bully. Now that he’s working outside his element, he will keep pushing us toward authoritarianism because it is literally all that he has ever known. To him and his peers, that’s “negotiating.” To everyone else in the world, it’s a temper tantrum from a grown man who thinks getting his way is his birthright. It’s counterproductive and foolish, of course, but it’s also very dangerous." True link

He’s doing it with foreign policy and trade, and he did it with healthcare. His “great deals” in the past have consisted of outright fraud, cheating of partners, or manipulation of the system. Like a lot of people who are insulated by wealth, he doesn’t know how to negotiate except with threats. When he doesn’t hold all the cards, he has no idea what to do. Then Trump made a mistake. After singling out Meadows and asking him to stand up in front of his colleagues, Trump joked that he might “come after” the Freedom Caucus boss if he didn’t vote yes, and then added, with a more serious tone: “I think Mark Meadows will get on board.” It was a crucial misreading of Meadows, who has been determined to please both the White House and his conservatives colleagues on the Hill. Upon assuming the chairmanship of the Freedom Caucus earlier this year, Meadows was viewed suspiciously by some of his members who worried that the North Carolina congressman is too cozy with Trump and would hesitate to defy him. Meadows campaigned extensively with Trump last fall and struck up a relationship with White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, who communicates with him almost daily by text. Meadows knew the heath care fight would be viewed as a test of his independence from Trump, and the moment the president called him out, he was boxed in. “That was the biggest mistake the president could have made,” one Freedom Caucus member told me. “Mark desperately wanted to get to yes, and Trump made it impossible for him. If he flipped after that he would look incredibly weak.” Further, he also has no interest in diving in and working hard. This is the mark of a businessman who is so accustomed to being away from the details of the work that he has no idea how to do it anymore, if he ever did. His lieutenants are supposed to be there for this, and without them he has neither the energy or the intellect to accomplish anything on his own. As George W. Bush complained about after learning it in his second term, the job is difficult, and it requires much more than just being the “decider.”" True link

The movement was actually galvanized in the 1970s and early ’80s, when the IRS revoked the tax-exempt status of Bob Jones University and other conservative Christian schools that refused to admit nonwhites. It was the government’s actions against segregated schools, not the legalization of abortion, that “enraged the Christian community,” Moral Majority co-founder Paul Weyrich has acknowledged. By openly embracing the racism of the alt-right, Trump effectively played to the religious right’s own roots in white supremacy. Richard Spencer, president of the National Policy Institute and the alt-right’s most visible spokesman, argued during the campaign that GOP voters aren’t really motivated by Christian values, as they profess, but rather by deep racial anxieties. “Trump has shown the hand of the GOP,” Spencer told me in September. “The GOP is a white person’s populist party.” One of the most insightful and important articles you’ll read this week."
