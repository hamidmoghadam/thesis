I was having an anxiety attack about going alone and trying to make the decision to go or not because I didn‚Äôt want to disappoint anyone. Told my mom I wasn‚Äôt coming and she was understanding. Pulled myself together and drank tea and took my meds, in bed for now." True text

We hope the week two prompts for Mental Health Month are treating you well. In the spirit of the theme, posting it for each other, we wanted to celebrate one of the most helpful communities out there: yours. You‚Äôve helped shape Tumblr into an incredible community for support. To take a look into exactly how it‚Äôs flourished over the years, we teamed up with Fandometrics (@thefandometrics) to bring you some sweet, sweet data.How you talk about mental healthDiscussion around #mental health has steadily grown year over year since 2013, with a 248% uptick of original posts and reblogs made between 2013 and 2016. In that same time span, original posts and reblogs about #therapy increased 29%. Much of that conversation was rooted in real people sharing real stories. Emotional and honest stories, like how therapy can help you better understand your life, how to say good-bye to the wrong therapist, or the difficulty of making the sometimes daunting decision to begin therapy for the first time. There has also been a significant rise in people seeking ways to take care of themselves. The self-care movement has seen huge increases in searches (733%) and original posts (567%) between 2013 and 2016. Over the past six months, we‚Äôve seen total engagement (searches, original posts, reblogs, and likes) around the #self-care tag spike with correlations to holidays and events in the news:240% increase the day after the US Presidential Election321% in the days following Christmas and Hanukkah561% in the days leading up to the Inauguration, and342% in the days following Valentine‚Äôs Day.Anatomy of a postTo get a better understanding of what the public-facing conversations consist of, we looked at the top posts for the #mental health, #positivity, and #self-care tags from the past few years. We noticed a few trends that continued to appear over and over again:Masterposts, a one-stop shop of information on topics like learning new hobbies, treating yourself on a budget, and resources for different mental health issues continually pop up in these tags.Doodles like @thelatestkate‚Äôs positive messages illustrated with cats or @gemmacorrell‚Äôs Self Care Reward Stickers are a Tumblr favorite. There‚Äôs also been a neato collaborative trend where someone doodles a text post made by someone else, ¬†like this art of living by cat principles, by @bisexualpiratequeen and @skunkaru.Text Art like @sexioto‚Äôs reminder to take your meds and¬†@peytonfulford‚Äôs message of more self love turn the text itself into art. In the mental health space, text art most frequently comes in the form of reminders, like to stay hydrated and to make yourself a priority.Make your dash more positiveBecause this is all about posting it for each other, here are a few great blogs to make your Tumblr experience more positive and healthy:Positive Vibes (@posiviibes) provides positive and friendly text art in soothing colors.LGBT+ Positivity (@goodpositivitylgbt) focuses on messages of positivity and validation for the LGBT+/MOGAI community.Why Did You Feel Proud Today? (@todayifeltproud), a space to submit your accomplishments, big and small.For more follow inspiration, check out our roundup from last week. We‚Äôll be posting more each Friday this month. Keep sharing your stories, Tumblr, this month and every month. So so honoured to be included in this. Our proud community is growing and it‚Äôs filling my heart!   Welcome to all our new followers- so happy to have you on board the self love boat!!  " False text
