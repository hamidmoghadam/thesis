Thanks for your generous support!(Want to become a sponsor? Consider donating at the Hematocrit level!)I’ve gotten a lot of variations of this ask.Does the bullet stay in? Does it get taken out? What are the consequences? What are the after effects?“Lead poisoning”  is a common ER and EMS term for someone getting shot. “What happened?”  “Lead poisoning.” is a conversation between a medic and a nurse that  would make 100% sense, even though the character is bleeding out on the  stretcher.But does leaving a bullet in lead to lead poisoning? As in, actual elevated levels of lead in the blood?It depends!First, the myth that the bullet must come out! is a Hollywood trope, based off of Civil War medicine. So let’s look at where that comes from.The  idea that the bullet has to come out typically comes from a mindset  that the bullet is, by itself, inherently dangerous. And back in the  Civil War, that was true, not because of the bullet but because of the  wadding that stuffed the bullet into the musket.See, it was  infection, not lead poisoning, that made those gunshot wounds more  dangerous, because the wadding was typically covered in bacteria – and  injected directly into a wound. Removing the bullet would also allow the  physic to remove the piece of cotton, and remove the source of the  infection. (In the modern day we would call this source control.)But  these days, our typical GSW patient doesn’t have a wadded-up piece of  cotton in the wound, and if they do, it’s something pulled in behind the  bullet. It’s superficial, and easily picked out with tweezers forceps. So the infective risk of leaving bullets in place is actually pretty low.In fact, in the modern era, doctors actually tend to leave a lot of bullets in place.The typical process looks like this:The character gets shot (owies!) and goes to the hospital.The doctors (read: trauma team) will examine the wound and get x-rays or, more likely, a CT scan (NOT an MRI!)Actually, further research indicates that MRIs are safe with most bullet types, but docs tend to be conservative about this. The  wound itself will be explored surgically, especially if it’s in the chest or the abdomen. If the docs happen to find the bullet  along the way, they’ll remove it, but removal isn’t the goal, it’s repairing significant bleeds and organ damage, finding other things that might have been in the wound and evaluating  the underlying tissue. If the bullet is in a location that’s risky  to perform surgery to get to, such as the chest or the abdomen, the  bullet will likely actually get left in place. The theory is that the  risk of surgery outweighs the risk of leaving the bullet in place.Similarly,  if the bullet is in an extremity where surgery would be easy, but the  bullet is close to a nerve or significant piece of vasculature, the  bullet is likely going to be left in.Really, removing the bullet is a matter of convenience, not of necessity.But what about lead poisoning?Ahhh, yes, lead poisoning. Where we started. Where we’ll finish.Lead poisoning is surprisingly rare with gunshot wounds, even if the bullet is left in place.The reason is this: the tissue will actually grow a capsule around the bullet and prevent the lead from leeching out into the bloodstream. The  only significant risk is if the bullet is lodged in the bone, and even  then, it can take years for symptoms of lead poisoning to develop.And if that DOES happen? Here’s the symptom list:●Abdominal pain (“lead colic”) ●Constipation. ●Joint pains. ●Muscle aches. ●Headache. ●Anorexia. (Decreased appetite) ●Decreased libido. ●Difficulty concentrating and deficits in short-term memory. ●Irritability. ●Excessive fatigue. ●Sleep disturbance.●Anemia. ●A “lead line,” a bluish pigmentation seen at the gum-tooth line, is the result of a reaction of lead with dental plaque.  ●Confusion, seizures, and encephalopathy (brain swelling) can be seen with extremely high levels of lead.And that’s all she wrote!Thanks UpToDate!

She went like this with different toppings and sauces for a description of him, like pineapple if he’s blonde, black olives if he’s tall, extra large if he’s tall, etc. They’ve heard this sort of coded call before.  They’re trained for it.  They will understand what you’re saying.  Order the pizza.

They created Steve as a form of protest for Hitler and what was going on in Europe. Joe Simon quote:   “We both read the newspapers,” Simon said. “We knew what was going on over in Europe. World events gave us the perfect comic-book villain, Adolf Hitler, with his ranting, goose-stepping and ridiculous moustache. So we decided to create the perfect hero who would be his foil. I did that first sketch of Captain America, and Jack and I did the entire first issue before showing it to (publisher) Martin Goodman at Timely Comics. He loved it immediately.” Friendly reminder that the first issue of Captain America, which featured art of Steve punching Hitler in the face, caused a lot of controversy among the Nazi sympathizers in New York, so much so that Simon and Kirby were constantly being threatened. At one point Timely (re:Marvel) received a call from someone in the lobby threatening bodily harm to Kirby if he showed his face. And Kirby, proving just where Steve got his spirit from… went on down there to fight the bastard.      “…Jack took a call. A voice on the other end said, ‘There are three of us down here in the lobby. We want to see the guy who does this disgusting comic book and show him what real Nazis would do to his Captain America’. To the horror of others in the office, Kirby rolled up his sleeves and headed downstairs. The callers, however, were gone by the time he arrived.” Based on everything we know about Kirby, these Nazi crank-yankers got lucky.”   But the threats did not stop there…   “Years later, [Kirby] told an interviewer, ‘I once got a letter from a Nazi who told me to pick out any lamppost I wanted on Times Square, because when Hitler arrived, they’d hang me from it. It was typical of a genre of fans who have long since died out.”   Friendly reminder that when America did join the war, and despite the success they had with the Captain America comic, both Simon and Kirby joined the service. Kirby was drafted into the Army, Simon joined the Coast Guard. In fact Kirby was a successful scout for the army and during that time discovered and helped liberate a concentration camp. During his service he got severe frostbite and almost lost his legs. Afterwards he was awarded a   Combat Infantryman Badge and a bronze battle star. Friendly reminder that both Kirby and Simon were proud of Steve to their dying day. In fact, according to Joe Simon’s granddaughter, Megan Margulies, Joe’s apartment, right up until the day he died, was covered floor to ceiling in Captain America paraphernalia.  …and this is the legacy that Nick Spencer is denigrating with this current story-line.

You might have heard of it, but the election of our next President is currently taking place in France, so I’ll write this quick words, in both English and French, in hope that a lot of you will read it.  This is me begging you to go vote on May 7th. I kept scrolling on twitter today and all I could see was hashtags terrifying me. #JamaisMacron (Never Macron) #SansMoiLe7Mai (Without me on May 7th)…On April 25th, we voted for 2 candidates. Despite our hopes, the two names that came out were Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen. You might not know them if you’re not french, but both those names held different stories. While, yes, Emmanuel Macron is a guy that can’t keep his mind straight, change his words every five seconds, is said to be too young to be President, have some « peculiar »  and stupid ideas , he is nothing compared to Le Pen. She is the leader of the far right, the « Front National », and she is a fraud. a political leader behind a party you should be scarred of. Racist, antisemitic, homophobic, anti-immigration, anti-multiculturalism are some of the words that could be used to describe them.  Truth is, I don’t want either of them to become my President, but we have to put pride and hatred aside. We are French, guys, we are free, we are a nation, we are a beautiful madness, WE are France.Terrorists attacks can’t divide us. I know I’m scarred, I don’t feel safe, and I don’t trust our politicians, but never, NEVER, will I give up my freedom and my identity to elect someone like Marine Le Pen. No, she’s not Hitler, she’s not the devil, she’s just a woman, a human being, and we have the power to keep her from ruling our country. That won’t be done by sitting on your couch on May 7th, or by giving an empty envelope when you’ll go vote, or by putting the hashtag « Sans Moi le 7 Mai ». You have more than a right to vote, you have an obligation, toward yourself and toward your country. You might not like it, you might hate Macron even, but you have a voice, and we all know one voice can change everything. So go vote on May 7th, vote for Emmanuel Macron, not because you like him, or because you like his ideas, but because giving him your voice means blocking the way to a party that will destroy our country, our beliefs and most certainly our life. Please, please, please, don’t sit this one out. Go vote, because if you don’t, then you’ve made your choice, you chose the National Front and everything it stands for. It’s not voting for, but voting against. Who’d you rather have, a weird liberalist with no party and early alzheimer (and a very bad way with words), or a woman who’s going to destroy everything being french means ? It is not easy, but necessary. Choose life, guys, choose France.  With all my love, a very concerned french citizen. ——————————————————————————————————- Salut tous le monde, je ne parle normalement jamais de politique, mais cette fois c’est vraiment, vraiment, vraiment, vraiment important.  Je vous supplie d’aller voter le 7 Mai. Toute la journée, je n’ai vue que des hashtags qui m’ont fait atrocement peur sur twitter; #JamaisMacron - #SansMoiLe7Mai …Le 25 Avril, on a voté pour 2 candidats. Malgré nos espoirs, les deux noms qui en sont ressortis sont ceux d’Emmanuel Macron et de Marine Le Pen. Vous ne les connaissez peut-être pas si vous n’êtes pas français, mais ce sont deux noms avec deux histoires bien différentes.Il est vrai qu’Emmanuel Macron est un homme qui n’a pas l’esprit clair, qui change de mots et d’avis toutes les cinq secondes, qui est dit trop jeune pour être Président, et qui a clairement quelques stupides idées très « particulières », mais il n’est rien comparé à Le Pen.Elle est le leader de l’extrême droite, le Front National, et c’est une arnaque à elle seule, un leader politique derrière un partie dont vous devriez avoir peur. Racisme, antisémitisme, homophobe, anti-immigration, anti-multiculturalisme sont quelques mots qui pourraient bien les décrire.  La vérité étant que je ne veux qu’aucun des deux ne devienne mon(ma) Président(e), mais nous devons mettre de côté notre fierté et notre haine. Nous sommes français, les gars ! Nous sommes libre, nous sommes une nation, nous représentons une magnifique folie, merde, NOUS sommes la France. Les attaques terroristes ne doivent pas nous diviser. Je sais que j’ai peur, que je ne me sens pas en sécurité, que je ne fais pas confiance à nos politiciens, mais jamais, JAMAIS, je ne renoncerais à ma liberté et mon identité pour élire quelqu’un comme Marine Le Pen. Non, elle n’est pas Hitler, elle n’est pas le diable, elle est simplement une femme, un être humain, et nous avons le pouvoir de l’empêcher de gouverner notre pays. Ca ne se fera pas en restant assis sur votre canapé le 7 Mai, ni en rendant une enveloppe vide lorsque vous irez voter, ni même en écrivant ce fameux hashtag « Sans Moi le 7 Mai ».Vous avez plus qu’un droit de voter, vous avez une obligation, envers vous-même et envers votre pays. Vous n’aimez peut-être pas ça, vous détestez peut-être même Macron, mais vous avez une voix, et nous savons tous qu’une seule voix peut faire toute la différence. Alors allez voter le 7 Mai, votez pour Emmanuel Macron, pas parce que vous l’appréciez lui, ou même ses idées, mais parce que lui donner votre voix veut dire bloquer la route à un partie qui pourrait détruire notre pays, nos croyances et probablement même nos vies. S’il vous plaît, à tous ce qui lisent ce mots et ont le pouvoir de bouger les choses, à tous les français, ne faites pas l’impasses sur ces élections. Allez voter, parce que ne pas le faire, c’est déjà faire un choix, le choix du Front National et de tous ce qu’il soutient. Rappelez vous que ce n’est pas voter pour, mais voter contre. Qui préférez-vous, un libéraliste étrange, sans partie avec un alzheimer précoce, ou une femme qui pourrait détruire tous ce qu’être français veut dire ? Ce n’est pas facile mais nécessaire. Choisissez la vie, les gars, choisissez la France.  Avec tout mon amour, une citoyenne française très inquiète.   Anyone who posted about the American election needs to reblog this.  France, don’t do the same thing we did in the USA. Don’t do it. Go vote for that young guy.  The racists are voting. Go meet them at the polls " False text

Steve Bannon was recently appointed as Chief Strategist for President-elect Donald Trump. It was simply a promotion for Bannon, who served as CEO of Trump’s presidential campaign. Bannon, though, was not an experienced political strategist. He was the head of Breitbart News. Just a few months ago, he openly bragged that under his leadership he transformed Breitbart into “the platform of the alt-right movement.” Those are his words — not from some distant past, but from this past July. I’ve said it many times, but the alt-right movement is simply the KKK without the hoods. They are skinheads with suits and ties. They simply chose a new name, but are fueled by the same hate and the same philosophy as previous white supremacist and Neo-Nazi movements. Trump adviser Stephen Bannon boasts that ‘darkness is good’ This weekend, it all came to a full boil. Richard Spencer, who coined the term “alt-right” and is seen as one of its founders and public intellectuals, openly wore his Neo-Nazi heart on his sleeve. I can hardly believe what I am about to quote. At an Alt-Right conference being held, of all places, in a federal building in Washington D.C., Spencer didn’t even attempt to hide his bigotry and anti-Semitism. According to the NY Times, He railed against Jews and, with a smile, quoted Nazi propaganda in the original German. America, he said, belonged to white people, whom he called the “children of the sun,” a race of conquerors and creators who had been marginalized but now, in the era of President-elect Donald J. Trump, were “awakening to their own identity.” As he finished, several audience members had their arms outstretched in a Nazi salute. When Mr. Spencer, or perhaps another person standing near him at the front of the room — it was not clear who — shouted, “Heil the people! Heil victory,” the room shouted it back. Yeah, that really happened. The movement that the incoming Chief Strategist of the White House brazenly built an online home for is openly quoting Nazi propaganda in German in federal buildings and giving each other Nazi salutes. Not in the 1930s, but this weekend. We simply aren’t being clear enough. When you build, fund, and promote the online home for the modern-day Neo-Nazi movement, and openly brag that you have done so, that makes you a supporter and enabler of Neo-Nazis. If someone built, funded, promoted, and openly admitted to creating the online home for the latest iteration of ISIS, you know what they’d be called? Terrorists. Doing any such thing for the latest version of ISIS would likely get someone jailed, but doing it for modern day Neo-Nazis has gotten Steve Bannon access to the highest levels of government. One does not have to do a Nazi salute in public to be a Neo-Nazi, but let’s be clear — Steve Bannon is at least an ally of Neo-Nazis. The man Donald Trump has appointed as his Chief Strategist has worked for years to not only normalize the alt-right movement, but to give it a home and that movement is fundamentally bigoted. Unless you are willfully ignorant, such a thing is not in question. His own former employees have openly said that Breitbart News, under Bannon’s leadership, has openly embraced bigotry, white supremacy and anti-Semitism. Bannon’s ex-wife, before any of us had ever heard his name, said that he was anti-Semitic. As a compliment, Andrew Breitbart, the founder of Breitbart News, openly called Bannon the “Leni Riefenstahl of the Tea Party movement.” Leni Riefenstahl was a famous Nazi filmmaker and propagandist. She worked directly with Adolph Hitler. Such a “compliment” blows my mind. No man who has openly received such a compliment should ever be in the Oval Office. How much clearer can it get? Stop normalizing this man. Stop calling him a hardcore conservative. He’s much, much worse than that. He is being openly celebrated and adored by hate groups because they see him as one of them. They seem him as one of them because he is. Steve Bannon is a bigot. He has created a home for bigots and anti-Semites. His own boss complimented him by comparing him to a Nazi propagandist. All of this comes as New York City experienced a staggering 31% increase in hate crimes in our city. Of course our police chief does not want to say, “Donald Trump caused this,” but such a steep increase in hate comes from somewhere. Donald Trump and Steve Bannon are empowering and emboldening these elements in our country. With every day that passes, our nation grows deeper in shame for who and what it has allowed to get this far. Mind you, all of this was known and widely shared about Steve Bannon before the election. We live in a time where a man who empowers Neo-Nazis will be crafting policies and strategies in the highest, most important office in the land. This is not a joke. This is not an exaggeration. This is America. 2016. " False link

I know, I was there. Step  outside of the city, and the suicide rate among young people fucking doubles. The recession pounded rural communities, but all the recovery went to the cities. The rate of new businesses opening in rural areas has utterly collapsed. I live in a town of 700 people.  We’re a lot more prosperous than most small towns in our area; but that is on shaky ground and could change in an instant.  (Remember, “a lot more prosperous” means that 2/3 of the commercial buildings in town stand vacant, boarded up.  In some of them, you can see daylight through the gaps in the boards, because the roof is caved in.  And in a town of 700 people, 40 separate households needed help from the food pantry last year–that’s about 20% of the population.  We’re still doing better than a lot of the surrounding towns.)  We have a small school–pre-K through high school–and it graduates between ten and twenty kids a year.  In the last decade, there have been three teen suicides in town.  We as liberals tend to have a lot of sympathy for urban poor living in  those kinds of conditions.  We’ll defend them at the drop of a hat–and  we’re right to do so.  But that sympathy disappears when it comes to the  rural poor.  It doesn’t even register that they face most of the same  problems you get in the ghetto, with even fewer services and programs to  help.  We’ll talk about rural racism and homophobia and sexism all  day–and all of that exists–but we don’t talk about the very real  poverty and hopelessness and other problems that they face.   You know what that does to a community?  You know the kind of grinding hopelessness that causes it in the first place?  When everything’s going to shit and the larger world doesn’t care, only mentions you if you’re the butt of the joke or they can proclaim their moral superiority?   If you were drowning in that every day, and somebody said they’d save  you (and kick all the assholes who laugh about you in the teeth while he  did it), wouldn’t you want to support him even if he was an asshole you  despised? Now, you know and I know that Trump isn’t going to actually save them–he’d have to be able to come up with a coherent policy, for one, which, hah, ain’t going to happen. And also you and I know and I know that even if he did save all the coal mine and power plant my town depends on it would be disastrous for the whole world in the long run.  But Hillary doesn’t really have any plans that might help rural areas like mine, either, and some of her plans would hasten our destruction.  Most of them are, in the long run, better for America and the world.  (Sure, the rural areas will continue their slow, grinding, painful death, while being mocked for their poverty and backwardness, but America as a whole will be better.)  Try telling that to people watching their communities die and their kids and friends kill themselves or drown in bottles. It really does feel like the worst of both worlds: all the ravages of  poverty, but none of the sympathy. “Blacks burn police cars, and those  liberal elites say it’s not their fault because they’re poor. My son  gets jailed and fired over a baggie of meth, and those same elites make  jokes about his missing teeth!” You’re everyone’s punching bag, one of  society’s last remaining safe comedy targets. “The rural folk with the Trump signs in their yards say their way of life is dying, and you smirk and say what they really  mean is that blacks and gays are finally getting equal rights and they  hate it. But I’m telling you, they say their way of life is dying because their way of life is dying.  It’s not their imagination. No movie about the future portrays it as  being full of traditional families, hunters, and coal mines. Well,  except for Hunger Games, and that was depicted as an apocalypse.” And yes, there’s parts of that way of life–the racism, the sexism, the homophobia, to name just a few–that should die.  But there’s good parts, too.  There’s beauty, and love, and strength, and kindness, and generations of families working together to build community and a future.  There’s traditions that have nourished and supported generations of people through meaningful lives–even if you might not recognize anything in those lives as important.  And all of that is crumbling. Neither Clinton nor Trump (nor any national politician of the last decade or anywhere on the horizon) can change that.  You’d have to somehow dramatically alter the economy to bring jobs back to rural areas, and even if you could find a viable way to do it, more populated areas would probably scream bloody murder at the resources being diverted.  But Trump, the vicious, narcissistic, bigoted, homophobic, ableist, misogynistic, jingoistic, fascist turd that he is, at least pretends that he can, that he can bring back the way things were when all those empty buildings downtown were filled and the kids weren’t killing themselves and rural areas at least sometimes saw themselves in popular culture as something other than the butt of a joke.  It’s a lie, and a dangerous one, but I don’t blame my neighbors for wanting to believe it.  Particularly worth reading for @beatrice-otter’s addition. I know that many people here on Tumblr don’t want to sympathise with conservatives, and most particularly not people who support Trump; but everyone has reasons, and those reasons do amount to more than just “sexist, racist, and homophobic”. The thing to remember is that even if Trump loses, you will still be living with your fellow Americans. You may not have to pay attention to them outside of the election cycles, but believe me, now that they’ve had someone tell them ‘I’m on your side, I can turn the world back to when your communities thrived’, they’re going to be a lot noisier in those election cycles.  “Step outside of the city, and the suicide rate among young people fucking doubles.”“No movie about the future portrays it as being full of traditional families, hunters, and coal mines. Well, except for Hunger Games, and that was depicted as an apocalypse.”I’ll be over here thinking for a bit.

Trying to write speech in a way that mimics the way we speak isn’t something that comes naturally—like just about everything writing-related, it takes a lot of practice and a lot of reading to get a good feel for it.I’ve written some do’s and don’t’s for writing realistic dialogue in the past, so I won’t reiterate all of that, exactly, but I think there’s still more to be said for writing dialogue that doesn’t fall flat, so here are five more points to think about:Language is always evolving. I recently took a Linguistics class (such a good decision, writing-wise), and the number one lesson repeated throughout the semester was this: language is always changing. This is really important to consider, especially if you write YA, because teens are huge drivers of language change and it changes *so* quickly. Slang that was popular just five years ago is already falling out of favor: teens don’t say really “(epic) fail” or “pwned” anymore, for example. It’s your responsibility, as a writer, to keep up to date with the way language is changing, especially if you write for teens.Think carefully about each of your characters. How much education do they have? What regional dialect are they a part of (remember: everyone has an accent)? Do they swear a lot (or at all)? Are they likely to speak formally or informally? Do they tend towards long or short sentences? All of these factors and more will play into how they speak, and it’s up to you to make sure each character has their own distinctive speech style.When writing Beyond the Red, this was something I had to think about a lot, given that my two main characters come from very different backgrounds and levels of education. It wouldn’t make sense for Sepharon (alien) royalty to speak the same way a guy who was raised by human nomads did. Culture, education, and even personality should all be considered when differentiating the way your characters speak.Not all conversations are straightforward. Real-life conversations can be very complicated and nuanced. People frequently don’t say exactly what’s on their minds—we speak through subtext, we use tone and body language to add meaning to our words, we answer questions with questions or silence, and we change topics or end conversations when we don’t want to talk about something. Consider:“I told him we’d go to the afterparty,” Leah said.Bree laughed. “Of course you did.”OR“I told him we’d go to the afterparty,” Leah said.Bree rolled her eyes. “Of course you did.”Same exact words in both of these conversations, but I don’t need to explain how Bree’s body language completely changes what she’s saying.Don’t omit contractions needlessly. 9/10 times when I read dialogue that feels stilted, this is part of the problem. People speak with contractions all the time—without them, we sound like robots at best, and laughable at worst. Even if you’re writing historical or a formal character, you do not want to omit every single contraction: your characters will only sound stiff and unnatural.Many teens swear. While not all teens swear, writing teen characters who deliberately don’t swear (oh, fiddlesticks!) can often sound contrived. If your teen character doesn’t swear, it’s okay…but make sure you aren’t censoring just because—and definitely make sure your teen isn’t surrounded by other teens who magically don’t swear either. It’s honestly just not very realistic—and teens will notice.These are just a couple points on writing realistic dialogue, but now I want to hear from you.What tips do you have for writing speech that doesn’t sound stilted?

This post isn’t about that, exactly, but while I was tweeting about it, @Holly1994 brought up a point that really resonated with me, in that she compared claiming vampirism/lycanthropy is a chronic illness is similar to all those blind characters out there who have superpowers that totally negate their blindness. Which…got me thinking about how so very common it is for disabled characters to have superpowers that totally erase their disability.  The biggest and easiest example here, of course, is Daredevil—a character who is blind, but whose superpowered senses are so enhanced that he can see through sound, sort of, so he’s blind but…not really. He can still navigate with little difficulty and fight crime and be a total badass due to his ability to sense things around him in precise detail.  I looked up some other examples and found quite a few (by the way, some of the source links have super ableist language, JSYK):  Dr. Mid-Nite: blinded by an explosion, but can see in pitch blackness for some reason, so he wears special super-dark goggles so he can see during the day—and fight crime at night.   Captain Marvel, Jr: character who has some kind of physical disability that makes mobility difficult, but can transform into an able-bodied superhero to fight crime before transforming back into his non-superhero, disabled self.   Thor: Apparently in the 1962 comics, Thor also had the transform thing: his “human” self needed a mobility aid to get around (a cane) because Odin wanted to teach him a lesson in humility (which is majorly problematic for entirely different reasons, but I digress), but he could transform into Thor, who is able-bodied, to be a hero.   Iron Man: in the comics, Tony Stark is injured and becomes paraplegic—but he can still move his legs and fly around as Iron Man in his suit, and apparently the comic writers got tired of writing him as disabled and cured him with a biochip implant.   Komodo: A bilateral amputee graduate student who stole The Lizard’s (from Spider-Man) serum to regrow her legs and became a trainee Avenger.   Doctor Strange: apparently a car accident resulted in nerve damage that caused the loss of use of his hands—until he found magic and became a sorcerer.  I’m sure there are other examples, but you get the idea.  The problem here is exactly what I mentioned above: their superpowers directly negate their disabilities. Physically disabled characters are suddenly able-bodied again, because, apparently, they couldn’t be superheroes otherwise.  Of course, there are examples of superheroes who’s abilities don’t negate their disability–Professor X, for example, who is paraplegic and telepathic—but his telepathy doesn’t make him able to walk again. And Hawkeye who (eventually, at least) is deaf and learns sign language to better communicate—but his supernaturally good aim doesn’t negate the fact that he can’t hear. Right now at least, I don’t personally have a problem with disabled superheroes whose powers don’t erase their disability. I think it’s cool that many disabled kids may be able to see a character like them who is superpowered and badass but still has to deal with the same difficulties they do with their disability. However, the narrative of superpower-erasing-disability is so very common, and that is a problem. Because the implication is the only way to make this disabled character awesome is to make him able-bodied. Because people then point to those characters and say there’s your disability representation—you have enough representation already. Because they are, in essence, saying what makes those characters cool is the way they can erase their disability with superpowers. And that’s not fair. Because it totally erases difficulties disabled people have to wrestle with while still claiming to be representative.  We need more disabled characters—and I want to see them save the world, and hunt down killers, and go to magical schools, and lead revolutions. I want to see them be totally awesome, and get the hot love interest, and be heroes.  But I also want to see them struggle with their disability. I want to see them get frustrated, and deal with ableism, and have bad days and good days. I want to see them take medication, and if their condition is degenerative I want to see them get worse, and be uncertain about the future, and not have a good answer for what life will be like in five, ten years. I want them to deal with their disability in real, tangible ways. I want it to affect their everyday lives, I want their disability to be visible and invisible, and I want it to matter.  But I also want to see them live. I want to see them get by just fine, and be the hero, and I want them to be an inspiration because they do incredible things—not because they’re disabled—and I want their disability to be normalized. Everyone deserves to see themselves represented, and for the disabled, that means in a way that doesn’t totally erase everything that makes them disabled to begin with. Everyone deserves to see themselves as heroes without being told the only way to do so is to erase their reality.  This is a really great post, and OP I don’t know if you have seen The Last Airbender, but if you or anyone has, what do you think about Toph? She’s not a superhero, but in a way her earthbending allows her to see more than others even though she’s blind. On the other hand, she struggles with her blindness in several episodes–when in water or on sand, when in the air. It’s even discussed in reference to how she views herself and others. Depiction of her disability is obviously nuanced, but–? I’m really curious to hear what disabled people think about this. " False link

Is there a special class of people (doctors, priests, funeral directors, untouchables) who deal with dead bodies? What things must be done and why (burn hair to free spirit, burn body to prevent necromancy, coins on eyes for ferryman, etc.)? Are the dead feared, revered, or ignored?

However, as a genderqueer person I do get a little joy from this. Now we just need someone science-y to point out sex is a construct. get fucked gender essentialists  someone send my dad this lmao  HUMANS ARE A SEXUALLY MONOMORPHIC SPECIES HUMANS ARE A SEXUALLY MONOMORPHIC SPECIES HUMANS ARE A SEXUALLY MONOMORPHIC SPECIES This is pmuch common sense. We are not anglerfish. We are not elephant seals. We are not orangutans. We are not peacocks. We are sexually monomorphic - that means there are literally no actual difference between males and females outside of our genitalia, and humans are similar to crows and dolphins in that aspect. And thus, our rigid concepts of gender and sex roles are entirely social constructs. One based on a myth of sexual dimorphism that does not exist in our species. Science, motherfuckers " False link

I love to stop in the paint section of a hardware store and find new names for red or white or yellow.  Having a variety of color names at my fingertips helps me to create specificity in my writing. I can paint a more evocative image in my reader’s mind if I describe a character’s hair as the color of rust or carrot-squash, rather than red. So for fun, I created this color thesaurus for your reference. Of course, there are plenty more color names  in the world, so, this is just to get you started.
