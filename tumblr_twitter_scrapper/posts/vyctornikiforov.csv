BUT it is not uncommon for an anime to get a movie sequel, followed by another TV anime sequel. K project did that - it was originally a TV anime that then got a movie that ended on a cliffhanger, that then received a second season. A second season announcement can come either in the credits of the movie or from the creators themselves at a later time. And think about it: two TV anime seasons and one anime movie? How much better does it get? It‚Äôs like getting two seasons and a half. And yes, I do believe that a TV anime sequel is likely after the theatrical movie. And let‚Äôs look at other positives! The animation will be absolutely gorgeous??? This time for sure, since movies work on completely different schedules and they are polished to be absolute goddamn masterpieces of animation (see: practically any theatrical anime movie). Not to mention that this pretty much solves the issue of the rest of the skating season that we see in the anime? Of course, we don‚Äôt yet know what the movie will be about, but if it finished up the skating season we begun in season one (we got about halfway through the season), then that can be a beautiful segway to a season 2 set in the off-season + the next skating season. It‚Äôs like we‚Äôre not missing out on any story content! Isn‚Äôt that perfect? Honestly, I‚Äôm very excited for this. This is probably the best way to solve the issue created by the fact that the first season ended halfway through the skating season. So while I know that many of us may feel a little disappointed, this will definitely turn out to be a good thing. :D " False text

Please come and help drown out the hate, show Kyoani that we‚Äôre thankful for them featuring our hard work, and allowing us to express how much we love both Rin and Haruka . Much thanks in advance guys. So‚Ä¶now we‚Äôre not allowed to be happy that people we gave a gift to said ‚Äòthank you‚Äô? You‚Äôre going to harass them for saying THANK YOU?? Where do people get the GALL to do shit like this in public to the creators? I recall people going to the official channel for the duet CD and downvoting the OFFICIAL PROMO VIDEO for the harurin duet CD just because they didn‚Äôt like the ship. That is some next-level fuckery there. Why not channel that salt into making something nice like this for your favorite characters too??  You are absolutely allowed to be happy but that is not the problem here. I am not part of this fandom but I have friends who are so this is my perspective on the whole matter. This ‚Äúcomment‚Äù was directed toward Kyoani themselves. The MH shippers worked their butts off making a huge box which was sent to Kyoani and they barely said anything to recognize all the work those fans put into it. It‚Äôs a shame that these ship wars happen but come on, being horribly mean to everyone and saying that the MH fans didn‚Äôt do anything for their favorite characters or should ‚Äúchannel that salt into making something"" is incredibly rude and shows how little you seem to care about other peoples‚Äô feelings.  I will state this again: The ‚Äúcertain fans‚Äù are NOT UPSET about this getting attention. Far from it. They ARE upset with Kyoani and how they seemed to disregard all the work put in to making an amazing gift box for them which felt like a slap in the face.  So the solution for hurt feelings is‚Ä¶to publicly lambaste KyoAni? There are probably a dozen reasons this project got a pic and public tweet and the other one didn‚Äôt; having seen the other project‚Äôs pics, I half wonder if a box that was supposed to be for Makoto‚Äôs bday but contained a heck of a lot of MH shippy content wasn‚Äòt deemed inappropriate to publicly post a picture of‚Ä¶ (this book had explicit rules set up to keep it from being overtly shippy even though the entire point was to express gratitude for the mook). You can‚Äôt know WHY they chose to post pics of this project in particular; maybe the person who received it had access to the social media account and posted it immediately in this case. I mean, I doubt anyone can argue it‚Äôs because BASED KYOANI when we get reminded on pretty much a daily basis that ~lol ur ship is the loser~~~ Pick an explanation and stick to it lol. KyoAni gave you an English-language site to keep international fans updated. I can absolutely say that the other box had influence on that. It sucks you didn‚Äôt get a public pic and acknowledgement. But my sympathy for you wanes when you go up to them and start whining about it. Yes, it does seem strange that they would acknowledge one and not the other. But the solution isn‚Äôt to directly complain to them about it.  I love makoharu reactions to this because first off you copied the idea after making fun of it because god fucking forbid you don‚Äôt steal ideas from literally everyone else to make everything about fucking Makoto, then you made explicitly shippy stuff even while knowing kyoani will never make any ship actually canon (ever. Ever. EVER. Deal with it.) and then you complain about them not publicizing a bunch of yaoi drawings that would likely put them on the spot? Shut the fuck up and stop being so entitled. You‚Äôre arrogant, stupid and you need to pipe the fuck down. And by the way once again you showed what a bunch of assholes you are. Congrats mh fandom, you showed your true colors again.  Disregard all their work??? KyoAni already sent the fans who sent the box a personal email thanking them for it and for their love for Makoto!! They GOT acknowledged!! Face it, they just wanted their box get a goddamn picture on the website, but maybe didn‚Äôt REALIZE that half of the box was full of shippy stuff that KyoAni could NOT photograph publicly. DEAL. WITH. IT. KyoAni thanked international fans for their love and got shit for it. If this is what they get when they do something nice for their fans, maybe they‚Äôll just reconsider listening to their fans all together. Good going, MHs. You ruined it for everyone. Are you happy?  I don‚Äôt know what to say, other than to voice my disappointment. Not in the fact the photo was taken down, or that things went crazy, but in the fact that‚Ä¶ Well.¬† This is one of the VERY FEW instances where a¬†Japanese¬†anime production¬†company openly reaches out to its international fanbase, with a heartfelt¬†‚Äòthank you‚Äô and acknowledgment of our existence. Which is almost unheard of, because the international market is only a tiny fraction of their fanbase to begin with.¬† And what happened is they got attacked for it??? ‚Ä¶This is the kind of¬†‚Äòthank you‚Äô you‚Äôre giving them in return for them reaching out to you? For opening up an english website for the fans? For saying¬†‚Äúhey, we see you, thanks for supporting us from overseas!‚Äù, and putting it up on the internet for all to see? And not naming any names or campaigns either, just calling it¬†‚Äúinternational fans‚Äù. All of us.¬† ‚Ä¶ Why would you do this? What were you trying to achieve by attacking them? Did you really feel so entitled to ask, no, DEMAND for them to put something up from an event that took place months ago, and might not be possible to photograph anymore. I‚Äôve seen a lot of stuff in this fandom. But this is the most heartbreaking thing to happen in it.¬† The company you supposedly love for giving you content you enjoy - under vicious attack from the fandom they just thanked. You threw it back in their faces instantly.¬† I can‚Äôt believe this‚Ä¶ I still can‚Äôt believe this happened.¬† Good job‚Ä¶ I hope you‚Äôre happy‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll be surprised if this drama doesn‚Äôt reach anime news websites. :( ‚Ä¶¬† " False link
