I’ve actually never tried the bath bombs, but their skincare and haircare products work magic.  Fading Scars / Stretch Marks Organic Therapy Massage Bar Extra Dry Skin King of Skin In-Shower Body Conditioner, Skin Drink Facial Moisturizer, Sultana of Soap Bar, Tender is the Night Massage Bar, Each’s a Peach Massage Bar Acne Fresh Farmacy Solid Cleanser, Eau Roma Toning Water, Full of Grace Serum Bar Thickening Lashes Eyes Right Mascara / Lash Milk Edges R&B Hair Moisturizer (if you put this on your edges before wrapping your hair, they’ll be relaxer-straight when you wake up, lasts about 12 hours), Dirty Styling Cream (cream-based edge control with a matte finish, no more shiny or crunchy edges)  Hair Growth NEW! Shampoo Bar, Retread Hair Conditioner  I was asked to list the rest of the products I currently have in my possession, so here y’all go! FACE / HAIR STUFF Magical Moringa Facial Moisturizer Oh my lordy. Let me tell y'all about this stuff. It’s marketed as a moisturizer but I use it as a primer because when you put this on your face, it’s completely matte. Like completely. All day. And it will lock your makeup in place like no other. You can sweat in it, swim in it, whatever. Shit won’t budge. Ever. Jason & the Argan Oil Shampoo Bar Amazing for volumizing. It made the three bundles in my head look more like five when I used this thing the first time, I kid you not. Also gives your hair a really natural shine. I only use it when I really need a volume boost, otherwise it’s just too much. No Drought Dry Shampoo If you have a weave, you need this stuff. Period. A lot of times, the natural oils in our scalps (referring to my fellow black women here) are too heavy for Brazilian, Peruvian, etc hair, and so it’s easy for weave to get weighed down between washes. Shake this stuff in your hair, brush it out - bam, flow city. Honey Trap Lip Balm My favorite lip balm, ever. Really improves the texture of your lips and seals in moisture. However, this is not for fixing chapped lips - use Ultrabalm for that first, and then this to prevent them from chapping again. Also, pro-tip, if you apply it before liquid lipstick, your lipstick won’t crease or dry out all day. MASSAGE BARS Strawberry Feels Forever Smells like fresh strawberries! Has a much thinner consistency than the other massage bars, so it can be used every day, like a solid lotion. Soft Coeur Smells like chocolate and honey, and is ridiculously moisturizing. More heavy-duty than the other bars, so I like to only use this one on spots like my knees, heels, and elbows. From Dusk til Dawn The shape of this one is amazing. It’s shaped like a cone, so it gives a deep massage when you’re using it. Definitely recommend if you have any sort of muscle pain. SCRUBS The Rough with the Smooth This stuff smells soooo good. Like cotton candy. I use it before I shave because it really does an amazing job at removing any dead skin and it doesn’t leave a residue, so it won’t clog your razor. However, it’s a sugar scrub, so it melts super quickly. Ocean Salt This is a heavy-duty scrub. Really amazing if you have dry, flaky skin, and the healing properties of the salt are really great if you have acne. It’ll dry it up and heal it super quick. Cup o’ Coffee Face & Body Mask I’m on my fourth jar of this already. The coffee beans are ground up just enough to give a deep, yet gentle scrub and the caffeine in the bar really does wake up your skin and make it look brighter. Great for the morning. Buffy It smells like a vacation, that’s really the only way to describe it. It’s an exfoliant bar and body butter mixed together, so you rub it all over while you’re still in the shower, and then rinse the sand off. After, rub the oils in and pat dry. No need for lotion after because it seals in the moisture from your shower. SHOWER GELS / JELLIES Rose Jam Shower Gel Smells like roses and has a really bubbly lather. More cleansing than moisturizing. I like to use it before a more moisturizing soap because it’s great for removing dirt and oil from the skin. The Olive Branch Shower Gel A long-time favorite of mine. Great for dry skin, as it has a really creamy lather versus a bubbly one. Also, the smell is very calming and lingers for a long time. Needles & Pines Shower Jelly It’s a solid shower gel (consistency of jello), and it smells like Christmas trees! I like to store it in the fridge and use it when it’s hot outside, super cleansing and refreshing. SOAPS: Roses All the Way Personal favorite! Smells like roses & vanilla ice cream. Super moisturizing and so, so creamy. Definitely buy if you suffer from dry skin. Yog Nog Very moisturizing and the scent lingers for a really long time. Smells like snickerdoodles and eggnog. Bohemian Not at all creamy, as it’s an exfoliating soap. It’s great to use on dark spots like knees and armpits because the exfoliants soften the skin and the lemon juice evens out your skintone. Smells like lemons. Karma Another favorite. It has a super thin consistency but is still very moisturizing, so it’s a good shaving soap because it won’t gunk up your razor. Smells like incense and patchouli. Figs & Leaves Smells like dirt and grass, in a good way. Super cleansing. As in your skin will literally squeak after using it, so I recommend using an in-shower moisturizer like King of Skin after using it. OTHER: Atomic Toothy Tabs Solid toothpaste that you crush up in your mouth. It sounds weird but these things are phenomenal. They really leave your teeth squeaky clean, and are the sole reason my teeth are so white - I don’t use any whitening products. This particular kind smells like cloves and cinnamon. Ultrabalm All Purpose Balm This stuff is amazing. It’s an all-over balm for rough spots. I use it in the winter time on my hands and lips, because they get dry. I also use it year round on my face where I get dry spots, as it doesn’t clog pores. Silky Underwear Dusting Powder Another holy grail. If you could turn cocoa butter into a powder, this would be it. It’s not drying like baby powder, it’s more silky (it’s also talc-free). I use it between my legs to prevent chafing and under my boobs when it’s hot outside to prevent sweating.  This is actually so helpful because a lot of times I go into lush and I just end up getting pink things and things that smell good because I don’t know what other products are worth purchasing!  TALK TO PEOPLE. okay so I only worked there as a seasonal, but these overly polite, overly talkative salespeople have to do 3 demos an hour! SO if they ask if you want to try something, let them. They know what they’re doing and they will tell you everything you want to know about the product and what it will do for you. The worst was when I had customers saying that they were just looking because they didnt know a thing about what they were looking at. A lot of the products look identical on the shelves, but they are all specifically tailored for different needs. Fun facts: 86% of all products are vegan, the rest are vegetarian everything is ethically sourced, including the charcoal which comes from recycled forest fires Lush will cut ties with their suppliers if they dont treat their employees nicely enough Lush saves 10% of their spending budget for emergencies, like when a well broke down in one of their suppliers companies over in Kenya and Lush found out they were lowering women into the well, that money didnt just go to repairing the well, but for getting them a second well as well. Lush even makes perfume but the scents are about stories instead of smells. There’s a little booklet for each one. My favorites are Dear John (about the owner, Mark, not knowing who his dad was) and Dad’s Lemon Tree (which he made after meeting his dad) Lush also makes makeup, although they are working on getting more pigments Lush is 21 years old and in 57 countries! Charity Pot is a lotion that is low scent as not to mix with your other scents, is a lot of cocoa butter, and 100% goes to grassroots charities, they dont even pay people to make it, that’s how good it is If you bring in 5 black pots (wash them please, they are dishwasher safe) you can get a free fresh face mask Lush is the inventor of the bathbomb and most of them have essential oils in them and cocoa butter, so they’re not just fun, but they’re actually really good for your skin There is a Lush Facebook page but more importantly is that there are local Lush facebooks. You can ask them if something is in stock and they’ll get back to you as quickly as possible (the Alderwood location takes only a few hours) Anything that looks like a big brick of product is sold by weight. Just ask and they will cut you off a piece to fit your budget FREE SAMPLES. Feel free to ask. They do NOT want to sell you something that is not right for you Everything is handmade with commercial kitchen like equipment. This is why things don’t always look the same, because the recipe changes and different people are making it. Leave room for error and basically Guenivere likes adding more pigment than Brendan does but Brendan makes seasonal stuff that’s fantastic. It’s not that it’s gone off or is poorly made. There’s a little sticker that shows you who made it and it also has the expiration date on it It the ingredient list is both green and black, the green is for natural ingredients and black is for synthetic. If you go in and they dont have something because it was a seasonal or it’s no longer being made, do not be sad. The same scent may be in another product but more importantly, you can still get it. THE LUSH KITCHEN puts out products that are no longer being made every night at midnight (UK though so time stuff). There’s exclusive merch on there too, including bags and aprons and shirts. Everything goes really really fast though so you have to be ON it.  reblogged to the wrong blog because it took 4 attempts to reblog at all!  this is…nice " False text

That’s how ADHD works sometimes.This is part 1.EDIT 1/1/17: New images added to point #7 and header formatting fixed. Please share this version instead!1. We’re not all hyperactive, extraverted little boys.We can be:AdultsFemaleNot hyperactive (this is called Inattentive type). IntrovertsAnother myth is that men have hyperactive or combined ADHD and women have inattentive ADHD. But there are men with inattentive ADHD and women with hyperactive or combined ADHD. They’re just less common.Yet another myth is that people with ADHD lose their hyperactive symptoms by the time they grow up. Many do, but there are still adults with combined type around.2. Some of us get good grades and behave well in school.A common myth about ADHD is that we’re just misbehaving kids who need to be spanked more. Nonsense like this:But actually, many of us looked more like this in school, especially if we had Inattentive type ADHD.When bored, we can daydream, look out the window, or doodle. Teachers might not notice us, or might even enjoy teaching us.  Furthermore, some people with ADHD are smart, learn easily, and are interested in school. This lets them get good grades…until the demands to turn organized work in on time become too overwhelming.3. We can pay attention. We just can’t regulate our attention.Some parents and doctors claim a child can’t have ADHD if they can focus on video games for hours. Nothing can be further from the truth. If anything, we have trouble stopping!We can focus for hours on something that interests us. Or on procrastinating. But we’re worse than most people at focusing on things that are boring or unimportant to us. We also have difficulty controlling the amount of attention we pay. Our attention works like this:When we pay full-on attention, it’s called “hyperfocus.”Hyperfocus is great when you’re writing a paper, but exhausting when you’re doing mindless tasks like washing dishes or checking e-mail.4. We don’t always think fast, talk fast, or have lots of energy.                 Some of us struggle with fatigue and slow processing speed. In fact, a new subtype of ADHD, Sluggish Cognitive Tempo, was proposed to describe this problem.The stereotype about ADHD is that we can’t focus because there are too many thoughts and sensations in our heads, and we keep jumping from one to another. But those of us who fit the Sluggish Cognitive Tempo description can be distracted for very different reasons.Imagine how you feel after getting only three hours of sleep several nights in a row. You probably feel groggy, have very few thoughts moving through your head, and respond slowly when people talk to you. You probably have trouble concentrating, multitasking, remembering to do things, and making decisions. Instead of having too many thoughts, and noticing too many things, you have too few. You just feel like you don’t have the energy to pay attention to anything. That’s what it’s like.This experience is sometimes called “brain fog.”We can also have inconsistent processing speed. Sometimes, I think and talk so fast it irritates other people. Everything feels like it’s happening in slow motion and I get bored. I interrupt other people because I’ve already processed what they’re saying before they finish, and I don’t realize it’s my listening that’s finished, not their talking. Other times, I am just about to answer someone’s question when they irritably repeat themselves, or ask why I’m taking so long to answer. It feels like I’m thinking at normal speed, but other people’s reactions make clear that I’m going too slow. 5. We’re not all athletic adrenaline junkies.There’s a stereotype that we’re adrenaline junkies who perform surgeries, jump out of planes, or travel round the world starting new businesses.   First of all, many of us have delays or disabilities with motor coordination. As children, people with ADHD can have difficulty with:Using scissorsHandwritingTying shoesThrowing or catching a ballRiding a bikeSecond, when you look at the people with ADHD who fit this stereotype, what do they have in common? Most are men, with high energy and either hyperactive/impulsive or combined type ADHD.Even in mice, male and female brains react to stress differently. It’s possible that men, who tend to externalize, are more likely to thrive on stress. By contrast, women tend to internalize, and might get overwhelmed instead.Up to a certain point, increasing stress helps you focus. That’s why some people wait until the last minute to study for exams.But past a certain amount, becoming more stressed starts to hurt you.And long term, living under high stress hurts both your physical and mental health.Some people with ADHD rely on increasing their stress levels to get stuff done. A disability services counselor I met in graduate school actually recommended this strategy to me. She should have known better. Even if you benefit from putting yourself under stress, you will pay steep long-term costs. Having seen family and friends pay them, I don’t think the costs are worth it. TL;DR, Not all of us benefit from stress, so we don’t all seek it out.6. Some of us are socially awkward penguins, not social butterflies.Another stereotype describes us as social butterflies who hide our school difficulties by playing class clown or making friends with everyone. But some of us are socially awkward.We can come off as awkward or rude because we’re not paying attention and miss cues.We can have poor sense of timing and inconsistent processing speed. These can make us interrupt other people, or just seem weird.We can be annoying. We interrupt other people, talk too much, change subjects often, or zone out in the middle of a conversation.Like elderly people, we can tell you the same thing many times because we forgot we told you.We also often forget what you tell us. It takes heroic effort to remember, say, friends’ birthdays.As a result, many of us have mild social difficulties that don’t meet criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder.  People with ADHD are also more likely to be on the autism spectrum. 7. Being diagnosed and labeled can improve our lives.People worry about letting their child be diagnosed or labeled, because they think it will make people treat their child worse.But when you actually talk to people with ADHD, many of them had a very different experience.Having the label is a relief.It gives you understanding. It gives you words to describe your experiences for the first time. It means you’re not broken. It means there are other people like you.The title of a popular ADHD book, “You mean I’m not lazy, stupid, or crazy?” describes the feeling well.                 I’ve written about how bad it is to grow up without a diagnosis, and how good it feels to get one, here, here, and here.What it feels like before diagnosis:What it feels like after diagnosis:8. Stimulants don’t turn you into a zombie, but they’re not a cure, either.If a person with ADHD gets the right medication at the right dose, they don’t turn into zombies. They just become a better-functioning version of themselves.But stimulants don’t cure ADHD. Yes, if taken for a long time, they do create changes in the brain. But the person still has the same underlying characteristics. If they stop taking stimulants, their ADHD symptoms will become visible again.Stimulants, like antidepressants, should be thought of like insulin for diabetics. They’re not a cure, and they need to be taken long-term. But they help you manage your symptoms and live a full life.9. Stimulants aren’t the only way to manage ADHD, and some of us choose not to take them.Some people with ADHD choose not to take stimulants. And it’s not just because they hate drug companies or fear that the drugs will turn them into a different person.First of all, only 80% of people with ADHD respond to stimulants. The other fifth can try other kinds of medications. These include:wakefulness medications (like Provigil),medications that treat mood disorders (like Welbutrin),Non-stimulants designed to treat ADHD (Strattera, Edit: NOT Concerta)Non-stimulants are less powerful than stimulants, so they reduce ADHD symptoms less, but they also have fewer side effects.Which brings me to the main reason people with ADHD avoid stimulants: side effects.Stimulants activate the sympathetic nervous system—the one involved in the fight or flight response. As a result, you can get the following side effects:Increased heart rateIncreased anxietyLoss of appetiteIncreased rate of headaches and migrainesWeight lossNote: These symptoms are probably the reason for the claim that stimulants stunt children’s growth.If we’re not taking stimulants, you might see us consuming huge quantities of more socially acceptable drugs: caffeine and nicotine.That person who goes through a pot of coffee a day, always has a Pepsi in hand, or can’t quit smoking? They might be self-medicating their ADHD.Please share this information and help combat myths about ADHD." False text

It’s also used as a way for healthy folks and neurotypical folks to distance themselves from their own bigotry. Because “crazy people” do all this violent shit and they’re not “crazy” so their homophobia or racism or ableism or misogyny isn’t the problem. Which is, of course, absolute bullshit.  Violence is most likely to be committed by neurotypical people who 1) have been taught horrible values and 2) have the power to get away with it. " False text

So, I don’t know if you’ve heard but the Wonder Woman film comes out June 2nd… And if you didn’t know that, there’s a reason for it. Warner Brothers aren’t spending money on promoting the Wonder Woman film. No tv promotions, billboards, nothing. A film about a strong, powerful, amazing woman superhero directed by Patty Jenkins who happens to be the first woman to direct a superhero film with a female protagonist and one of only a handful (a literal handful… you can count on one hand) to direct a superhero film at all. They are setting it up to fail so they can say “I told you so” and not only continue the blatant sexism in the film industry but blame it on Patty if the movie fails, setting female directors up (whom are already told they won’t get hired) so they can have an excuse to say “Oh well, we tried hiring a woman to direct a film and it didn’t work. Lets not do that again.” This film is bigger than just being a superhero movie… It has the ability to bust open the glass ceiling of Hollywood to tell them that yes, superhero movies about women do well and yes, women can not only direct blockbusters but they can do it well. Because I can guarantee you, Patty does it well. PLEASE spread this around and let Warner Brothers know we aren’t going to stand for this bullshit. GO SEE WONDER WOMAN JUNE 2nd!!!  This is a called a glass cliff (when men put women in positions of power + set them up to fail). I hope it doesn’t work this time!  An article that highlights the budget differences between super hero movies, such as super man, in comparison to wonder Woman’s : https://filmschoolrejects.com/we-need-to-talk-about-that-wonder-woman-budget-ef4b1b70f6d8/   Some articles talking about exactly this: http://uproxx.com/hitfix/wonder-woman-no-promotion/2/ http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/04/wonder-woman-marketing http://www.vogue.com/article/wonder-woman-gal-gadot-bad-marketing-promotion  Please for the love of God go see this movie! I’m stupidly excited for it!!!

Lieu’s bill, the Stop Waste and Misuse by the President (SWAMP) Act, states that Trump’s travel “results in the American taxpayer effectively subsidizing the president’s businesses.” The bill would also require that Trump reimburse the government for Secret Service costs derived from visits to his properties.

I came prepared, with printed and highlighted court cases, state statutes, and title IX excerpts. They didn’t listen, and refused to provide notes on the meeting or confirm that they had plans to punish me. I listened for about a week, and like before, I grew bolder, and stopped. I concurrently sent a FOIA Request for the communication between the school administration and the attorney, and after that was denied, submitted another request for a clarification of what happened in the meeting and the guidance they had given me. I was called down to my dean’s office and told to calm down. I didn’t. I instead sent my principal a letter and CC’d every faculty member of importance at the school. Mr. Jay Hoffmann and Associates, I regret to inform you that I sustained a mild head trauma some time before break, I am in fair condition and high spirits, but I must alert you to the fact that my memory was slightly affected by the incident and I have lost the ability to recall a particular event that took place in mid October, 2011. While I am not completely able to remember the exact happenings of said event, through a series of email searches I have managed to determine that this meeting concerned my ability to use the bathroom while attending school, but I have no recollection as to what specifically happened at the aforementioned meeting. If there happened to be anything of importance said during the October meeting concerning special instructions on how I am supposed to function within the school due to your understanding of my body or identity, I would like to know. Due to my active role within my community, the chances of me sustaining another memory altering head injury within the near future are staggeringly high — if you and your staff would like to avoid explaining what happened in the initial meeting and subsequent meetings with great frequency, as further head injuries occur, I highly suggest that you provide me with an official letter concerning any special instructions or punitive actions to be taken against me if I fail to comply. Since this head injury, I have used the school’s facilities as permitted by the Illinois Human Rights Act and will continue to do so until I am told differently in writing. Please note that any punitive actions taken against me will most likely result in a filing with the Human Rights Committee, FOIA requests for all communications pertaining to the event, press releases, news tips, and the raising of community awareness. I didn’t get called to the office anymore after this. In fact, the administration refused to speak with me until after I graduated. I didn’t get in trouble, and since I left, there have been roughly a dozen other trans kids who have gone un-bothered by the administration Could this have gone differently, particularly if I wasn’t in a state with laws on the books to help me? Definitely. But the point is, draconian laws are much harder to enforce on people who will fight you. If you’re a trans high schooler, have Title IX complaints typed up — yes, you can still file those — and let your administration know that you have them. Go scream at your school board until they carry you out. Show up at your principal’s office until you become a nuisance. Fax your superintendent until their machine runs out of ink. Send FOIA requests for everything you can think of, costing your school time and money. They want us to cower, so don’t.  I am proud to share a state with this young woman. Fantastic work, @alx-972 and that’s some seriously awesome lateral thinking.  Congratulations on graduation and keep fighting and inspiring!  hell yes.  this woman is my new role model. " False link

The dismissive and condescending attitude toward any black people who see blackness differently than she does is woven throughout her comments in our conversation. It is not just our pettiness, it is also our lack of education that is preventing us from getting on Dolezal’s level of racial understanding. She informs me multiple times that black people have rejected her because they simply haven’t learned yet that race is a social construct created by white supremacists, they simply don’t know any better and don’t want to: “I’ve done my research, I think a lot of people, though, haven’t probably read those books and maybe never will.” I might quote this piece all night long.

I don’t watch 13 Reasons Why, and I never will for very specific reasons, but I’ve been following its reviews – good and bad – because it stands to impact people, and it’s a subject I’m personally invested in for reasons that are about to become apparent. Warning: I’m about to hit on themes of suicide and self harm. I’m also going to talk about the final episode so: spoilers. One thing a lot of people have said in regards to the final episode and its depiction of the suicide is how visceral and realistic it is. How it did anything but romanticise the act, and how important that is. The author of the novel has spoken about the creative team’s choice to show it in detail for that reason. “We worked very hard not to be gratuitous,” the show creator says in Beyond the Reasons, the Netflix followup special, “but we did want it to be painful to watch because we wanted it to be very clear that there is nothing, in any way, worthwhile about suicide.” A noble idea. Too bad it’s one backed up by exactly zero substantive evidence to indicate it works. In fact, the actual evidence is super clear on the exact opposite. Suicide contagion is exactly what it sounds like: studies have shown that exposure to suicide — predominantly in the media, but also in fiction — increases the risk that others will kill themselves. It’s such a well understood concept that the media has very specific guidelines they must follow in order to ethically report instances of suicide. The premise of 13 Reasons Why itself breaks one of the basic tenets – “don’t disclose the suicide note” – but done with care, responsibility, and value of context, this isn’t overtly dangerous. I obviously can’t speak to how well the show handles itself there. What I can speak to is the suicide scene from the final episode. Because dear-readers, I sat myself down, cracked a beer with shaking hands, and made myself watch it so I could write this article. And oh boy. OH. BOY.  Keep Reading " False link

Just over 1% of US Arctic waters have been surveyed to modern standards. In truth, some of the maps we use today haven’t been updated since the second world war. Navigating uncharted waters can prove difficult, but it comes with the territory of working in such a remote part of the world. Over the past two months though, I’ve been navigating a different type of uncharted territory: the deleting of what little data we have by the Trump administration. At first, the distress flare of lost data came as a surge of defunct links on 21 January. The US National Strategy for the Arctic, the Implementation Plan for the Strategy, and the report on our progress all gone within a matter of minutes. As I watched more and more links turned red, I frantically combed the internet for archived versions of our country’s most important polar policies.  I had no idea then that this disappearing act had just begun.  Since January, the surge has transformed into a slow, incessant march of deleting datasets, webpages and policies about the Arctic. I now come to expect a weekly email request to replace invalid citations, hoping that someone had the foresight to download statistics about Arctic permafrost thaw or renewable energy in advance of the purge.

The response was ugly. Parade attendees shouted racial slurs, pushed and shoved protesters, and attempted to start physical fights. Others chanted “Get out of our Pride” and “Go home.” Groups of bystanders booed as the protesters began marching down the parade route.”   “We went in with an understanding what we were in a safe place where our concerns were going to be taken seriously,” Dagoberto Bailon, Trans Queer Pueblo’s general assistant, says. “But we were greeted by Pride immediately calling the police, which caused a lot of fear since many of us are undocumented.”  Racist gay white people are still racist white people.

It’s hard to tell, as Becky G delivers 99% of her lines with a sardonic lilt. Zack squints, then asks, “Girlfriend trouble?” Trini doesn’t respond. Beauty and the Beast: The Gaston-adoring sidekick LeFou (Josh Gad) shares a two-second dance with another man in the movie’s finale. It’s a scene, as Pop Culture Happy Hour panelist Glen Weldon put it when he tweeted, that’s “exactly the kind of throwaway gay joke Hollywood’s always churned out.” It wasn’t the only one either — LeFou’s dance partner is a character who, in an earlier scene, is shown being unexpectedly pleased with the women’s clothing he’d been forcefully clad in by a combative Madame Garderobe. And Star Trek Beyond: Then there was last year’s Star Trek Beyond, which, also before its release, made the reveal — one treated as a bigger deal in interviews than it ended up being onscreen — that its incarnation of Lt. Hikaru Sulu (John Cho) was gay. It did this by introducing a never-named-on-screen husband, played by screenwriter Doug Jung, who Sulu was shown pulling into an affectionate but not especially nonplatonic embrace during a visit as they strolled away with their daughter. “If you blinked, you missed it,” said George Takei, who played Sulu on the original Star Trek television show. “There are others who are dealing with LGBT issues much more profoundly.” All three studios made a big deal out of making LGBT characters textual, but they still assume their audiences are just as narrow-minded as they are. In a world in which How to Get Away With Murder plunked a scene of implied rimming between Jack Falahee and Conrad Ricamora onto primetime network TV two years ago, it seems particularly eyerolly to give a studio movie a pat on the back for including a shot of two men with their arms around each other, in a totally gay way, they swear.
