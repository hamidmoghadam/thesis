They want to hear from self-advocates about how we view autism, how it impacts our lives, our thoughts on medication for co-occurring conditions, and what we think are - and are not - appropriate goals for autism services and supports. We have heard from the FDA that they are mostly hearing from family members so far. ASAN is submitting comments, but we need to make sure they hear from as many self-advocates as possible. Let them know what you think!There are a lot of different ways to give them your feedback:Register for the meeting (in Silver Spring, MD) and participate in the audience discussionSign up to participate via webcast and submit questions and comments during the meetingSubmit a comment online from now through July 5th" True text

But some of them still want a pass on excluding disabled people. Right now, Members of Congress and corporate lobbyists are pushing H.R. 620, a bill that weakens the ADA. We need to push back: contact your Members of Congress and let them know that our civil rights don’t come with a waiting period.The House could vote on H.R. 620 as soon as this week. This bill:Lets  businesses avoid fixing access barriers for up to four months after  receiving a complaint – even though the ADA’s access requirements are  already 27 years old! Ignores the fact that the ADA is the most important civil rights law for people with disabilities. Ignores the extensive, free educational resources already available today to any business on how to comply with the law.

It  has been 27 years since the Americans with Disabilities Act. Disabled  people in our district have waited too long for access – and businesses  have had plenty of time to provide it.

Furthermore, if you’re starting PECS with a young child, no matter what the icons and the boards are made up of, they’re going to need frequent replacing. Especially the icons as they get lost or bent/broken/swallowed. That’s just the nature of young children. Especially ones with flappy hands. :)Depending on where you live, some schools and ASD programs will provide a PECS book for your child but having a back-up is ideal.

Even for a kid who speaks, you may still find PECS cards useful!  My younger kid (who was/is verbal*) felt much more comfortable when a future activity was laid out in PECS cards.  It helped him form and remember a mental image in his mind of what was coming up. He mostly needed this for novel activities (e.g., trip to a new place) but enjoyed having pictures on checklists for routines (e.g., the go-to-bed steps). *From time to time he will struggle to recall a word, especially in stressful/crowded situations, and having PECS icons around have helped then too.

This bill  would raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, require fair pay  for tipped workers, and end the discriminatory practice of legally  paying people with disabilities less than minimum wage. The Autistic  Self Advocacy Network supports the Raise the Wage Act, which will allow  workers with disabilities to earn a fair wage and transition out of  poverty.The Raise the Wage Act is the first  bill to include workers with disabilities in a fair minimum wage. Nearly  eighty years after the Fair Labor Standards Act, people with  disabilities continue to suffer as a result of an archaic and  discriminatory loophole that permits employers to pay workers with  disabilities a mere fraction of the minimum wage. Some employers pay  disabled workers, including autistic workers, only pennies an hour. This  form of wage discrimination keeps workers with disabilities in extreme  poverty. It also incentivizes employers to withhold reasonable  accommodations that would increase our productivity and earning  capacity, despite the fact that these accommodations are required under  the Americans with Disabilities Act. Furthermore, many of the workers who  currently earn the federal minimum wage are either individuals with  disabilities or people who are paid to support us, such as home health  aides and accessible transportation providers. Low wages are a major  reason why so many people with disabilities and our supporters are  unable to escape poverty. The extremely low minimum wage has also made  it difficult for people with disabilities to find qualified supporters  to help us live in the community. By increasing the federal minimum wage  to $15.00 per hour by 2024, the Raise the Wage Act will help promote  the financial security of people with disabilities and ensure our access  to adequate support, offering a way out of poverty that is currently  out of reach. The Autistic Self Advocacy Network is proud to support  this crucial and long-overdue bill." True link

But next week,  your Members of Congress will be back in their home states and  districts, holding town halls and office appointments with constituents.  This is the perfect time to voice your opinions, hold your  representatives accountable, and remind them that they work for you!Health care is one of the most  important topics you can talk about with your Members of Congress.  Millions of people with disabilities rely on Medicaid to get the health  care they need – and Medicaid is under threat. Yesterday, we received  the new CBO score for the House-passed ACA repeal bill, and learned that it still cuts $834 billion from Medicaid. But that’s not all–on Tuesday, we also learned that the President’s proposed budget cuts an additional $610 billion from Medicaid funding. Together,  these changes would cut the Medicaid program in half within 10 years,  putting millions of Americans’ health care — and lives — at risk.Here’s what you can do:To find out if there’s a town hall meeting coming up near you, visit TownHallProject.com and type in your ZIP code. To find your Members of Congress’ local offices, visit contactingcongress.org  and type in your ZIP code. Under the contact information for each  Representative or Senator, there is a list of their local offices. You  should make an appointment with the district office closest to you. You  can go by yourself, or go with a group. Script for setting up your meeting“My name is [Your Name] and I am a constituent of [Representative/Senator] [Name]. I would like to meet with the [Representative/Senator] or their staff during Congressional recess, to talk about [name one or two issues that matter to you]. Can we set up a time?” We know that advocacy at town halls and office visits really works — but only if you show up. You can learn more about relevant issues in our toolkits about the ACA, Medicaid, and getting through to your elected officials.Once you’ve had your meeting or gone to a town hall, fill out our form to tell us how it went! We still have a bunch of neurodiversity t-shirts from ThinkGeek to send to people who fill out our form! Remember: our Senators and Representatives work for us. Their job is to listen to their constituents and promote policies which will help the people they represent – not to take away your health care in order to fund tax cuts off the backs of people with disabilities.  If it seems like your Members of Congress have forgotten what their job  is, that means it’s more important than ever for you to remind them. Next week, let your Members of Congress know that doing their job means listening when we say: Nothing About Us, Without Us." True link

The  President’s proposal would deprive countless Americans with disabilities  of critical health care and community-based supports. It would jeopardize our very lives and result in a massive return to nursing homes and institutions.  ASAN calls on Congress to reject these devastating cuts and craft a  budget that invests in people with disabilities, our families, and our  communities. We have come too far to go back.The President’s budget would require  massive cuts to Medicaid, which acts as a lifeline for countless people  with disabilities. Medicaid is not only a critical source of health care  coverage but also the main funder for home and community-based services  and supports that help us live in the community instead of  institutions. But the President’s budget takes the $800 billion in  Medicare cuts proposed by the American Health Care Act and adds an extra $610 billion in additional cuts. This will reduce Medicaid funding by more than a trillion dollars over the next 10 years – a change that would cut the program in half.  This budget would eliminate $47 million for research on health care and services for autistic people and our families  that was provided via the Autism CARES Act. These services include the  Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental and Other Related  Disabilities (LEND) and Developmental Behavioral Pediatrics (DBP)  programs which train healthcare professionals to work with autistic  people. These cuts are in addition to $5.8 billion in cuts to the  National Institutes of Health and $35 million in cuts to CDC work  related to autism and developmental disability.The budget would also cut Social Security at the same time that it cuts programs that help us find jobs in the community. It promises $50 billion in cuts to Social Security Disability.  The only way to achieve such stark cuts is to kick people with  disabilities off the program, through punitive and impossible-to-meet  work requirements or other harsh changes which will result in people  losing their Social Security. While ASAN has always supported programs  to help people with disabilities find employment, these cuts aren’t  designed to move people to quality jobs that help them escape poverty.  In fact, the budget would also cut all Vocational Rehabilitation funding for state supported employment grants,  which are instrumental in helping people with intellectual and  developmental disabilities get and keep real jobs in the community.Furthermore, it would punish SSI recipients for living together  – including couples and families – by reducing their SSI payments. SSI  programs already force people with disabilities to survive on an average  of just $18 per day. Further cuts would force SSI recipients to choose between separation and starvation. To  make it worse, the President’s budget would also make massive cuts to  programs that are critical to people with disabilities living in  poverty, including a $193 billion cut to the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), or food stamps program, over the next ten years; completely eliminating the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) that helps low-income people pay their heating bills; and a $72 million cut to substance abuse prevention programs.In addition to cuts to our health care and community-based services, our community would see a $25 million cut to programs to build affordable community-based housing for people with disabilities  and a $7.7 billion cut to affordable housing programs overall. These  cuts could cause over 250,000 people to lose the housing vouchers. The  budget would eliminate the National Housing Trust Fund, which helps people with extremely low incomes escape or avoid homelessness. For  thousands of people with disabilities who are already struggling to  make ends meet, these cuts will mean homelessness or imprisonment in an  institution.Finally, this budget would cut  smaller but vital programs that increase inclusion and independence for  people with disabilities and our families. This budget would cut all federal funding for the Special Olympics, would eliminate programs that provide free legal assistance to people with low incomes,  and would sharply reduce funding for State Councils on Developmental  Disabilities, the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living,  and Rehabilitation Research, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health  Services Administration.  People with disabilities’ lives have value and  are worth investing in. We deserve more than this.When Congress threatened to cut Medicaid by over $800 billion, we showed up to fight.  Congress heard from the disability community in town halls, and through  countless phone calls, faxes, and letters. That fight isn’t over–but we  can win, and we can beat these cuts too.  We call on Congress to reject the President’s attack on the supports we  need to live in the community. Our lives are too important to be put on  the chopping block." True link
