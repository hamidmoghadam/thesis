He has showcased consistent growth and expansion in his talents along with a comfort in who he is as a person. He no longer clings to his title of being the angel, nor is his hair his defining quality. As someone who openly stated that he can’t do much without the members and is lacking, he has developed a talent for MC-ing and maintaining an entertaining atmosphere on his own. Jeonghan’s emotional intelligence proves to be an asset to his relationships with others, as he is able to read the member’s emotions and quickly deduce what to do to bring them comfort or note a discrepancy in behavior. He is able to convey these observations well when needed, in an understandable and gentle way. Since pre-debut he has been noted to be the member with the best personality. He can be mischievous but that doesn’t mean he’s uncaring or untrustworthy, in a sense he causes a small commotion because he finds his brothers cute and enjoys seeing their reactions to situations. On the note of emotional intelligence there is also comfort he has in his own emotions, as he is able to openly express his insecurities and thoughts on things that many idols would not feel very confident in doing so. He will openly cry over friendships that mean a lot to him, because he loves that deeply. His intelligence goes beyond that sphere - he is a quick thinker, resourceful and down right clever in achieving what he wants. He’ll come up with a course of action on the spot before anyone can react. OFD Staff members were even impressed with his quick thinking. He is not caught up in “the pride of a man” or pride in general, he’s a humble and will take everything in with reason, even if it invalidates his identity. He is comfortable in who he is and understanding of why he gets these comments - though you can see the slight disturbance in his eyes at these times (the boy is TIRED stop it). As a performer, Jeonghan has shown tremendous skill in integrating the emotions of the concept in his face, demeanor and actions. His vocals alone have improved quite a bit since debut, he has found the way to utilize the beauty and uniqueness of his voice. His dancing is fluid, sharp and gracefully articulated from torso to limbs. It’s like he transcends on stage in front of your eyes.   He was a freshly graduated young adult without a clue on what he wanted to do with his life and what he could do with his life due to his assumed mediocrity. Despite wanting to quit when times became difficult for him as a trainee, he didn’t. He preserved and is living the dream that found him.  His role model is Lee Taemin, as Taemin has shown growth in talent since his debut and has been noted for being skillful as an overall performer. Jeonghan is constantly striving to be better, for himself and for Seventeen. But people are more interested in his hair and soft features as opposed to his drive. Don’t tell me he’s not underappreciated just because he’s popular. me, outloud: Shut up. " False text

On buses and the metro people of all ages read rather than just listen to music and often even people with headphones on are listening to audiobooks. Everyone memorizes poetry in school and authors’ birthdays are celebrated.  Many Russians don’t even realize this is so. I noticed it instantly when I first came here 3 years ago because I compared it to my own country. The public transport thing is especially noticeable.  There are many reasons, cultural and historical, that reading is loved and appreciated in Russia.  But my friend recently pointed out a simple one that I didn’t even think about– Books are cheap. Cheap in rubles. Cheap for a Russian salary. Cheaper than a chocolate bar or a pack of cigarettes.  They’re accessible. Even people who aren’t in love with classic literature read for pleasure. Historians and waiters and cloakroom assistants and petroleum engineers alike.   So the next time you imitate a Russian accent and make jokes about someone simple living in a Russian village, remember that person you’re stereotyping has probably read more books than you.

Your mama should have raised you better than that anyway. 2. He’s self-conscious about his hands. 3. It appears to be a legitimate medical condition. I started thinking about it when I saw this post, which is specifically about splints for people with Ehlers Danlos syndrome, a congenital connective tissue disorder. It can present in a wide variety of ways - I studied it in school, but the OP of that post actually has EDS, so their blog would be much more helpful to read about it than mine. When I saw the pictures, a couple reminded me of Seokjin’s fingers, which my friend and I had just been talking about earlier today. I did some more research, and while I don’t think he necessarily has EDS - though he definitely has hypermobility in his fingers - I came across something called swan-neck deformity. Someone diagnosed with swan-neck deformity: Seokjin’s hands:  hypermobility: wearing a splint: and talking about how he had difficulty with the lighter in the Danger MV because of his fingers and thumb: (pictures not mine - all found on the twitter account jinsfingers.) A variety of things can cause swan-neck deformity, including rheumatoid arthritis and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, though it can just be congenital. There’s no real test to confirm it other than a doctor just looking at the hands.  He appears to have it in all eight fingers, and the related duck-bill deformity in his thumbs. If uncorrected, it could start to scar and lead to him losing some of the use of his hands. I hope he doesn’t have arthritis and that it’s not indicative of that or another painful illness, and I hope he doesn’t have pain in his hands because of it. Most of all, I hope that he does have a diagnosis and treatment. When I first saw that Silver Ring Splint Company, post, I thought, huh, someone should send that link to Jin. But then I scrolled back up and thought…no, really, someone should send that to Seokjin - it might actually help him. There is that picture of him with the splint, and if he could perform with jewelry-like splints like that, it might help him to keep from losing mobility and function in his hands. So yes. Don’t make fun of the man for something he can’t help, even if you think it’s just loving teasing. And maybe think about those ring splints for the next concept? #teamprotecttheprincess all day.  More people need to see this post. Especially the people who hate on him for it. " False text
