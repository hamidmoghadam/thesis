He accepts that he can’t fix Lito’s career troubles, that he can’t just make him feel better with a pep-talk and a positive attitude. He doesn’t tell Lito to cheer up, to go for a walk, to get over it. Instead he goes to his room, brings him breakfast and tells him “You don’t need to get up. You don’t need to leave this room. I’m not judging you, or trying to fix it, or tell you what to do. I just wanted you to know that I love you.    And that you aren’t alone.” And that’s really all Lito needs." False text
