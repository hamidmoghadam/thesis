J'ai juste peur de la mort, et j'imagine c'est parce que je commence à apprécier ma vie, à aimer vivre. 13 Reasons Why est tiré d'un livre. Ca parle d'amis qui ne le sont plus, d'amour quand on a 17 ans, de relations ado/parents, d'harcèlement, de slut-shaming, de viol, de trahison.Hannah c'est moi, c'est toi, c'est elle, c'est nous tous.Mon chéri à deux petites soeurs, dont une qui est en 3ème cette année. Quand j'ai annoncé que je regardais 13RW rècemment sur ma story Instagram, elle m'a écrit. Elle m'a rapporté que cette série lui parlait, parce qu'elle est en train d'apprendre ce que c'est d'être une femme dans cette société (malheureusement, non, c'est pas cool d'être une femme dans un contexte pareil), et que l'harcèlement, elle connaissait bien ce mot. Parce qu'elle l'a subit. Elle m'a dit que la série l'avait touchée, et aidée un peu. Qu'il ne fallait pas s'arrêter sur le premier épisode. Au début je ralais un peu, parce que l'histoire est présentée sous l'aspect d'un jeu, et je trouve que c'est déplacé d'introduire un jeu dans une histoire de suicide. Mais j'ai continué. Et bordel. Oui bordel. Juste, bordel. Il y'a déjà la bande son, qui est magnifique, et qui touche. Les musiques je les écoute encore sur mon ipod, la plupart sont magnifiques. Il y'a ce jeu dans la réalisation, ce jeu qu'il y'a entre le passé et le présent, le personnage principal a un pensement dans le présent, comme s'il était blessé physiquement suite au suicide d'Hannah. Et les lumières changent… Couleurs chaudes quand Hannah est à l'écran. Froide quand le présent nous rattrape. Les transitions sont bien trouvées, et même si on pense que c'est lent, que ça n'avance pas dans les premiers épisodes, les transitions rythment un peu plus le récit au fur et à mesure, et le récit devient plus intense par la suite. Ce que j'ai aimé particulièrement, c'est que cette série n'est pas gnangnan, elle n'est pas fausse, elle décrit les adolescents comme on peut en trouver dans les lycées actuels. Les viols et le suicide sont sans musique, sans chichi, c'est difficile à regarder, mais ça semble vrai. Ce n'est pas “glamourisé”.  Parce que je vous assure que c'est pas glamour de se faire violer, moi quand ça s'est passé y'avait pas les violons qui jouaient au fond de la pièce. La scène de suicide est vraiment violente cependant, j'ai du détourner le regard 2/3 fois, je ne pouvais pas, alors que généralement, je suis pas sensible à ça. Le personnage principal est attachant au fil des épisodes (au début je m'en battais un peu les couilles, sur la fin j'avais juste envie de lui faire un câlin et tenter de l'aider.)Cette série n'est pas un appel au suicide, comme j'ai pu le lire sur certains sites, mais une aide pour crier “à l'aide”. Si vous êtes perdus, seuls, déprimés, l'aide existe. Elle existera toujours. Vous n'êtes pas seul, jamais.13RW m’a redonné cette envie de vivre, de ne pas laisser tomber, d’avoir moins peur de la mort, et l’envie de continuer cette aide que je propose sur Tumblr. Voilà, c'était mon avis (dont tout le monde s'en bat les couilles), sur 13RW. Si t'aimes bien ce genre de post, mets un p'tit coeur, et dis le moi dans les commentaires. Des bisous. AELPS: Tu n'es pas seul.  " False text

Quand le mystère est trop impressionnant, on n’ose pas désobéir.When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey.🌟 3. La preuve que le petit prince a existé c’est qu’il était ravissant, qu’il riait, et qu’il voulait un mouton. Quand on veut un mouton, c’est la preuve qu’on existe.The proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming, that he laughed, and that he was looking for a sheep. If anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists.🌟 4. Mais les graines sont invisibles. Elles dorment dans le secret de la terre jusqu’à ce qu’il prenne fantaisie à l’une d’elles de se réveiller…But seeds are invisible. They sleep deep in the heart of the earth’s darkness, until some one among them is seized with the desire to awaken.🌟 5. Il ne faut jamais écouter les fleures. Il faut les regarder et les respirer. La mienne embaumait ma planète, mais je ne savais pas m’en réjouir.One never ought to listen to the flowers. One should simply look at them and breathe their fragrance. Mine perfumed all my planet. But I did not know how to take pleasure in all her grace.🌟 6. Tu as des cheveux couleur d’or. Alors ce sera merveilleux quand tu m’aura apprivoisé! Le blé, qui est doré, me fera souvenir de toi. Et j’aimerai le bruit du vent dans le blé…You have hair that is the color of gold. Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me! The grain, which is also golden, will bring me back the thought of you. And I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat…🌟 7. On ne connaît que les choses que l’on apprivoise, dit le renard. Les hommes n’ont plus le temps de rien connaître. Il achètent des choses toutes faites chez les marchands. Mais comme il n’existe point de marchands d’amis, les hommes n’ont plus d’amis. Si tu veux un ami, apprivoise-moi!“One only understands the things that one tames,” said the fox. “Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy things all ready made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends any more. If you want a friend, tame me…”🌟 8. Le langage est source de malentendus.Words are the source of misunderstandings.🌟 9. Voici mon secret. Il est très simple : on ne voit bien qu’avec le coeur. L’essentiel est invisible pour les yeux.And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.🌟 10. C’est le temps que tu as perdu pour ta rose qui fait ta rose si importante.It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.🌟 11. Tu deviens responsable pour toujours de ce que tu as apprivoisé. Tu es responsable de ta rose…You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed.

Ils perdent du temps pour une poupée de chiffons, et elle devient très importante, et si on la leur enlève, ils pleurent…“Only the children know what they are looking for,” said the little prince. “They waste their time over a rag doll and it becomes very important to them; and if anybody takes it away from them, they cry…”🌟 13.

J'aime bien les couchers de soleil. Allons voir un coucher de soleil…I am very fond of sunsets. Come, let us go look at a sunset…🌟 17. On ne sait jamais!“One never knows!”🌟 18. Il faut exiger de chacun ce que chacun peut donner, reprit le roi. L'autorité repose d'abord sur la raison. Si tu ordonnes à ton peuple d'aller se jeter à la mer, il fera la révolution. J'ai le droit d'exiger l'obéissance parce que mes ordres sont raisonnables.Alors mon coucher de soleil ? rappela le petit prince qui jamais n'oubliait une question une fois qu'il l'avait posée.Ton coucher de soleil, tu l'auras. Je l'exigerai. Mais j'attendrai, dans ma science du gouvernement, que les conditions soient favorables.“One must command from each what each can perform,” the king went on. “Authority is based first of all upon reason. If you command your subjects to jump into the ocean, there will be a revolution. I am entitled to command obedience because my orders are reasonable.”“Then my sunset?” insisted the little prince, who never let go of a question once he had asked it. “You shall have your sunset. I shall command it. But I shall wait, according to my science of government, until conditions are favorable.”🌟 19. C'est véritablement utile puisque c'est joli.It is truly useful since it is beautiful.🌟 20. ‘Où sont les hommes ?’ reprit enfin le petit prince. ‘On est un peu seul dans le désert.’'On est seul aussi chez les hommes’, dit le serpent.“Where are the people?” resumed the little prince at last. “It’s a little lonely in the desert…"" “It is lonely when you’re among people, too,” said the snake.🌟 21. Vous êtes belles, mais vous êtes vides…. On ne peut pas mourir pour vous.You’re beautiful, but you’re empty…. No one could die for you.🌟 22. Les hommes ont oublié cette vérité, dit le renard. Mais tu ne dois pas l’oublier.

FUCKING THANK YOU  As someone who had undiagnosed mental health issues until my fourth year of university, I can say, sometimes just attending school can be too much. Sometimes you have to drop your courseload. Sometimes it takes you five or six years just to get your undergrad. Your mental health comes first. Before your education and career. Some people are fortunate enough to have sound mental health and can, therefore, balance both work and school. But other people can’t. Some people can barely handle one. You don't know what’s going on in someone's head or in their home life. We do not all live by the same circumstances. We are all different. We are unique. And it’s that uniqueness that we are able to cope with things differently. If you can do both, good for you. If you can only do one, that’s fine too. If you’re struggling just to do one, I’m proud of you! You’re trying! If you can’t do either, that’s OK as well. Just because you can’t do them now, doesn’t mean you won’t ever be able to.

The state Senate approved a bill that would let adoption agencies discriminate against LGBTQ families on the basis of “religious beliefs,” even if the agencies receive state funding. And the House advanced a bill that would ban transgender students from using affirming bathrooms at school, in some cases potentially requiring them to use a separate facility altogether.   LGBT activists denounced both pieces of legislation. “It is appalling to see Texas lawmakers use their anti-LGBTQ agenda to block children from loving families and put the safety of transgender students in jeopardy at their own schools,” said Sarah Kate Ellis, president and CEO of GLAAD, in an emailed statement. “Governor Abbott should protect Texas’s reputation and economy by vetoing dangerous legislation like HB 3859 instead of letting Texas lawmakers sneak discriminatory legislation through while the nation’s attention is diverted.” “Fresh off its passage of the most anti-immigrant legislation in the nation, the Texas legislature this weekend turned its attention to targeting women and children,” said Terri Burke, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, in a press release. “With the passage of sweeping abortion restrictions and two measures authorizing discrimination against LGBTQ families and kids, our lawmakers seem determined to make discrimination Texas’s chief export.”  Texas.

It’s the latest in a trend of U.K. schools – including public schools – that are doing away with gendered requirements for uniforms. Under the previous policy at Highgate, girls were already allowed to wear pants and blazers, but boys were not allowed to wear the standard school skirts. While the school has faced some backlash from anti-LGBT groups across the country, headteacher Adam Pettitt and the rest of the staff are remaining committed to letting their students express themselves in whatever ways make them happiest.“[Some people] write in and say, if you left children to their own devices they would grow up differently and you are promoting the wrong ideas,” he said. “[But], if [students can] feel happier and more secure in who they are, it must be a good thing.”He concluded: “We will need to become understanding of what is a sensible reaction to this at different ages.”Around 80 state schools (or government-funded schools) in the U.K. adopted gender-neutral uniform policies as of 2016.

Dozens of men are in hiding.  Here’s part of the story you may not have heard: The Russian LGBT Network, an advocacy group that’s been helping Chechens escape, has been in touch with the U.S. embassy about securing visas for people trying to flee. While the U.S. hasn’t outright denied anyone yet, it has said in as many words that it will not be providing visas to Chechens trying to get out.  “We were informed there was no political will,” said the spokesperson, who asked her name be withheld because of security concerns. “They’re not going to provide visas. They’re going to support us in other ways, but not with visas.” […] A US State Department spokesperson said on background that all visa applications are considered on a case-by-case basis and the Chechens are eligible to apply. But US law does not have a visa category that allows someone to come directly to the US because of threats in their home country. Unless their situation fell into an unrelated category — like if they had a job offer in the US or were being reunited with a family member — they would only be eligible for tourist visas that would require them to prove they would return to Russia. “Nonimmigrant visa classifications and qualifications are set by U.S. law, as passed by Congress,” the spokesperson said. “There is no visa classification designated specifically for humanitarian relief.” […] The Chechens are not eligible to apply to come to the US as refugees because they are still inside their native country — someone fleeing persecution generally can only be considered a refugee once they’ve left their country of origin. A Russia LGBT Network official said US diplomats recommended Chechens try applying to the US after leaving Russia, but he worried that this could jeopardize their ability to ultimately reach a safe country legally if that route failed. There is also a risk they could be returned to Russia on trumped up charges. Many of the foreign fighters who have joined groups like ISIS have come from Chechnya, leading to concerns about Chechen asylum seekers. “They need refuge,” he said. “Not once did officials offer any specific solutions.”  Officials say they’re still looking for other ways that Chechens could come to the United States safely:  The Council for Global Equality, which advocates for LGBT rights in US foreign policy, said in a statement to BuzzFeed News that the organization was still hopeful an avenue could be found for the Chechens to come to the US despite the fact that the “Russian LGBT Network has been discouraged by their interactions with U.S. officials.” “We believe there are still options available in extreme cases like this and we are in contact with Russian LGBT activists and US government officials to continue to explore those options,” the statement said. “We hope there is political will on the Hill and within the Administration to provide a safe haven in the United States for carefully vetted claims.

He was 25. When Rowan was trying to change his name, you might remember, a judge initially denied his request because his desired middle name was “too male.” He implied that it would be “dangerous” for Rowan to have a male-sounding name and said that his name might offend the “sensibilities and mores of a substantial portion of the citizens of this state.”“After having been discriminated against by a judge who refused to allow him to change his name because he was transgender, Rowan wanted to make sure that no other transgender person was similarly insulted and objectified,” said Lambda Legal attorney Beth Littrell, who represented Feldhaus. “Because Rowan stood up, Georgia judges are now required to allow people to change their names without bias.” The transgender advocate was an Army reservist and a student.“Our hearts are heavy at the tragic loss of a courageous young man who fought for the right to determine his own name and destiny,” Littrell said. “Rowan’s grace, quiet dignity, strength and self-assurance were an inspiration to me and many others who heard his story.”Before his passing, Feldhaus made the decision to give the Gift of Life by registering as an organ donor, LifeLink spokeswoman Tracy Ide said. “With the support of his family, Rowan will now save five lives through organ donation and touch immeasurable others as the families, friends and communities of those who receive Rowan’s organs will be forever impacted by the memories, milestones and contributions made possible by this second chance at life,” Ide said.  This is just devastating. Sending so much love to his family and friends; rest in peace and power, Rowan. " False link

Now, Michael Stack has resigned. By the afternoon of May 11, however, Stack resigned, apparently hours after the school received a threat on his life. “The community apparently wants me out, so I hereby grant them their desires,” his letter read, according to The San Luis Obispo Tribune. “I exercised my First Amendment rights and submitted my opinion to a public forum… Now people are exercising THEIR First Amendment rights by responding to that letter. This is how America is designed to function.”Still, one parent said he was proud of the conversation the controversy had created. “I think parents need to realize that kids are a lot smarter than what some parents give them credit for,” Kenny McCarthy told local news station KRON 4. “Hopefully, this will get positive dialogue, learn from this and move on.”In a May 12 statement sent to HuffPost, Prater and O’Connor said the school district was taking “proactive steps to ensure” LGBTQ students “feel welcome and affirmed on campus” in the wake of Stack’s departure. “We encourage our students, staff, parents, and community members to understand that this a nuanced matter with many stakeholders, ideas, and opinions and we ask that everyone follow our students’ lead as we continue to hold a positive conversation on this matter going forward,” they wrote.So long, you hateful creep.

In each case, the men carried a gun, and stole personal property from their victims, including a car, according to The Washington Post. If convicted on the hate crime charge, the men could face up to life in prison, along with a $250,000 fine. They’ve also been charged with kidnapping, carjacking and possession of a firearm while committing their crimes.The North Texas Gay and Lesbian Alliance President Jeanne Rubin told CBS 11 News that she’s grateful to see the four invasions being investigated as hate crimes. “You can be scared as a homeowner if your neighbor is robbed,” Rubin said, “but it’s different if you feel like you’re being targeted for some reason and in this case a whole community can feel like they’re targeted.” Just awful.

But this week, the Mormon church announced that it will no longer provide scouting programs for boys ages 14 to 18. Many are wondering if the Boy Scouts’ (very slow) recent acceptance of LGBTQ boys has something to do with it. The most notable rift between the LDS church and the Boy Scouts opened over the organization’s evolving positions on LGBT issues. After the Boy Scouts’ decision in 2015 to allow gay leaders, the church issued a stern statement saying it was “deeply troubled” and that “the century-long association with scouting will need to be examined.”In the wake of that ordeal, a poll found that 63% of “very active” Mormons in Utah — where the religion is headquartered — wanted the church to end its relationship with the Boy Scouts.The Scouts opened their ranks to gay boys in 2013 and to transgender boys in 2017.Experts who spoke with BuzzFeed News said LGBT issues likely played a role in the church’s decision, though not an exclusive one. When the church first partnered with the Boy Scouts it had only recently abandoned polygamy. The partnership gave the church “a vehicle for promoting gender norms and particularly masculinity,” Michael Bowman, a Mormon and history professor at Henderson State University told BuzzFeed News.“For most of the 20th century, the church and the [Boy Scouts of America] walked pretty much hand and hand,” Bowman said. “As the BSA has been taking steps to alter that vision they have broken paths a little bit.”Slowly but surely, the Boy Scouts are becoming more accepting of all boys. If that doesn’t fit in with the church’s vision, it’s on them. " False link

She has not yet been identified.  While police told the New York Daily News that they are still investigating whether or not a crime took place, police sources told NBC New York that they are looking into the woman’s death as a homicide. No suspects have been identified, but police said her injuries were not from a fall or self-inflicted. An autopsy will be conducted to officially determine her cause of death. […] Last year, 27 homicides of transgender people were reported, according to GLAAD. It was the deadliest year for transgender individuals in the U.S. yet. However, the actual number of murders is likely higher due to both lack of reporting and police or families misgendering victims in news reports.  Rest in power.  " False link

They summoned his parents and brothers who all came. They said to them: ‘your son is a homosexual. Sort it out or we’ll do it ourselves.’ They replied: ‘It’s our family, we’ll do it.’ The family took him and killed him in the forest. They buried him there. They didn’t even give him a funeral.

The gender-neutral bathrooms will provide an additional level of privacy for those students who would prefer to use an individual restroom. The bathrooms will not require special permission or medical proof to use, and bathrooms in middle and high schools will also include free menstrual products (as do all NYC grade 6-12 schools). The bathroom initiative follows Education officials’ release earlier this year of updated Transgender and Gender Nonconforming Student Guidelines. The guidelines, published in 2014, now include “guidance on supporting transgender or transitioning students, appropriate pronoun usage and updating personal and pupil records to reflect a student’s gender identity,” Education officials said.“We are dedicated to providing every student with a safe, supportive and inclusive learning environment,” said Fariña. “As part of that commitment, we want to ensure that all students receive the additional privacy they need and have access to a restroom that aligns with their gender identity.”Let’s hear it for New York. " False link
