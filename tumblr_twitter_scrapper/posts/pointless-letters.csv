Y'all say you’re about calling out bullshit but when someone calls you on your own bullshit, you get defensive?

Not a “closet sobber”.Not like today! Britain - nay, the WORLD - has been ruined!When men were men! Made of cast iron, nicotine and racism! …an approach that absolutely caused no psychological problems across the centuries. No, not at all. But when, I hear you ask, did all this happen? What changed the British men of yore - stout heart every one - to the blubbing messes they are today? Surely such a change must have complex roots and not be traceable to one single incident? Oh. Never mind. No doubt we’re told this by “experts”. They’re probably foreign. If you don’t count the Normans in 1066, the Danish in 1069, The French in 1215, 1385, 1405 or 1548 or Perkin Warbeck’s three attempts in 1495,1496 and 1497 and god knows how many cross invasions between England, Wales, Ireland, Scotland and most of the countries of Europe at some point over the last ten centuries, yeah…Your dad would weep bitter tears of disappointment if he could, Parsons, but he can’t.

Two things that, for most people, would go unconnected. But most people are not Richard Littlejohn. You see, Richard Littlejohn is possessed of an exceptional, beautiful mind that sees connections where others do not. The connection that swung Richard Littlejohn into action was the story of a CNN reporter thinking that someone was flying an ISIS flag at the Pride march, when it was actually a flag with the outlines of sex toys on it. And Richard Littlejohn’s outrage was MIGHTY. How dare these people make light of such a thing, mere hours after a terror attack that claimed the lives of so many? Where was the respect?Because respect is important, remember. The point of this post is not to make fun. People died. Families are grieving. That is worthy of respect from everyone, and everyone attending the Pride march will completely agree with that. Richard is just expressing that sentiment, that respect is important, right? Remember, I said Richard’s outrage was MIGHTY. This is just building. If you’re sensing that Richard may not completely mean this….…then you’d be right. I’m not sure why there are sarcastic quote marks around “appropriate” but okay Richard, keep going. It’s all fun and games until someone….well…..writes about it in the Daily Mail. And this is the central argument Richard Littlejohn is trying to make. Respect is IMPORTANT. People died. Families were - and are - grieving. There are people in hospital recovering from physical injuries and there are psychological injuries that may never heal at all. (or writing his own column in a national newspaper)RESPECT, PEOPLE. But wait! What’s this? On the very same page as this rant about such a craven lack of respect on London’s streets? Why, Richard has written something else, look: RESPECT IS IMPORTANT. Flying something that looks like an ISIS flag days after a terror attack is BAD AND DISRESPECTFUL. Writing a column where you speculate a “What if” scenario where the gunman carried out his attack in Brighton and not Sousse, why that’s GOOD AND ENTIRELY RESPECTFUL.And what’s this, a few days later, in Richard Littlejohn’s column again? Respect. It’s all about respect. Remember, flying a flag that looks like that of ISIS at a Pride march = bad. Including it in a light-hearted illustration of an article based around a Dad’s Army pastiche is FINE AND DANDY. Because remember, folks, if Richard Littlejohn has taught us anything, it’s that respect is important. Except if you a) want to have a pop at the foreigns, the Muslims and the gays and b) are a hypocritical moral vacuum with access to a working copy of Microsoft Word. Then it’s fair game. But always, always, respect is key. " True text

Personally speaking, all my imagination could come up with was a massive, blown-up version of Tom Selleck’s moustache from Magnum PI….so I turned to you for ideas!Well, first of all, a few users pointed out that in terms of heterosexual flags, Leo might not have all that much to worry about: First up, Alistair Gellatly over on Twitter shared this…..inspiring? flag!Then, miniar here on Tumblr pointed out that there was…well….more grey!There! Are! Six! Flags! came the cry from tinyglowingsharks, again here on Tumblr….more grey!COLOUR OH GOD I HAD FORGOTTEN WHAT YOU LOOKED LIKEBut that last one…it just seems familiar somehow………nah, I can’t place it at all. Anyway, moving on, having learned that there were actually a whole load of “heterosexual flags” in existence, I was still keen to see what you could come up with. The competition was still on!(many thanks to Emily McQuade for this entry…..is the colour of shame the same as the background colour on the Mail’s sidebar of shame?)More…..grey?(thank you, Will Templeton!)Alexandra Craven’s idea - doubling as a hint to where the flag should go - is actually worryingly close to the flag that Cilla Black plans to fly over Downing Street when she seizes control in a bloody coup and forces us all to compete for food in episodes of Blind Date. Meanwhile, Jamie Canavan not only suggested a (colourful) flag for all the poor straight people, but a national anthem as well!newportdoll here on Tumblr went for “olde world classy” with this entry……while Chris Sleeps on Twitter went with something slightly more modern and less classy!And Ashles3000 built a whole narrative to the proud flag that would flutter in the breeze of a long, hot, summer’s day.All fantastic, excellent ideas, but the winner for me, for summing up the ridiculousness of Leo’s letter exactly, in one single image, is…*drum roll*Well done Scimmia Lustrini! Absolutely fantastic! You win two prizes - bragging rights and this handsome drinking vessel to pour your victory drink into: Now, who’s handy with a needle and thread?

I must have got this one wrong, surely? Well, stay with me on this……riiiiiight….You see, the line of reasoning runs like this: because a non-EU citizen  carried out a terrorist attack in a country that’s not in the EU, this  obviously means that we should get out of the EU. Because logic. Bear in mind, Kelvin waited a whole three days to write this. He wouldn’t want to be seen as writing something to back up a political agenda on the backs of over 30 dead people killed in cold blood, after all. That would be terrible. And that is the logical thread holding together Kelvin’s argument moving from “terrorist attack in Tunisia” to “we need to get out of the EU”. Tunisia is in Africa and people come from Africa to Europe so we need to get out of Europe because logic. “And build a great big fence all around the coastline, so no-one can get in! I mean, they come from Africa, so they’ve got to be up to something, haven’t they?”And just when you think Kelvin MacKenzie and The Sun couldn’t get any lower, they manage it. They actually manage to find a way to go lower and nastier than “use a terrorist attack where they are still identifying the dead to attack the EU”, which is an achievement in and of itself. Three days, that took. Well, just under three days. The attack took place at about 10:30 GMT on Friday, according to the news reports. So assuming the Sun goes on sale at, what, 6am? That would be about 68 hours? Classy. Take a fucking bow. " True text

It’s like if I said that Sally punched Billy. I am not saying Sally was right, I’m not saying Billy deserved it, I’m just saying that Sally punched Billy. Do you understand?”*sigh*The headline doesn’t say that. A fairer comparison, using your example, would be if the headline said “Did Sally punch Billy because JIMMY said he wouldn’t go out with her?” Your example headline has you stating facts as if that’s all the Daily Mail is doing. The Daily Mail’s headline fudges what seems to be a fairly clear-cut issue (in this case, responsibility for the shootings) by saying “Well, did he maybe do it because of THIS GIRL?”, the clear implication being, if she had gone out with him, would any of this have happened at all? So the responsibility for it happening lies not with Dylann Roof pointing a gun at several people and pulling the trigger, but with some girl for not saying yes to going out with him? I am sorry, but to call your argument monumentally flawed would be to massively promote your argument to such a high level it would get altitude sickness and die as it witnessed the curvature of the Earth for the first time.

Fast becoming the go-to text for fedora wearing friendzoned neckbeards everywhere, Stand By Your Manhood paints a bleak picture of a Britain - nay, a WORLD - in which women enjoy all manner of unfair advantages over men. But fear not! Tonight, we break from the doom and gloom! Yes, grimly silent wankchambers all over the country will be filled with relieved grunts tonight as we reveal the way forward for MEN to a bright, new future of EQUALITY!END THE DENIGRATION! ACROSS THE NATION!“It’s political correctness gone mad, is what it is.”Myth one: Not ruddy. Myth two: Not bloody.This would be the wage gap that is the subject of innumerable reports, analyses, articles, comments and discussions, right? The one where I put “UK Wage Gap” into Google and it comes back with 1,390,000 results? Riiiiiiiight.

NEXT!TL; DR - Fathers spend time with their children. AND DO THEY GET A MEDAL?

That’s just logic.”LOGIC BOMB BOOOOOOOM“I’ve lost count of the number of times I have sat in a restaurant alone, staring at couples, getting angry at the women. The women. ALWAYS THE FUCKING WOMEN AND THEIR JEWELLERY.”“We like these women. The ones we approve of. It’s a very exclusive club, you know.”NOT ALL MEN! (want to pay for dinner)Fedoras to tipping position “A”, please.“We totally respect women.”But remember, this always must be framed around THE MEN and how they are treated.

You see if we don’t!”AND THAT’S IT! If you have made it this far, well done. Remember, when you look at THE MEN in your life, be sensitive. Be nice.

All week we have been looking at the Daily Mail’s serialisation of “bloke bible” / “blistering polemic” / “deliciously provocative book” (or “hateful onanists manifesto”, whatever works for you), Stand By Your Manhood, detailing the way that men are marginalised, victimised, stamped on, belittled and otherwise oppressed in this cruel, cruel world. As with other nights, please have your fedoras and neckbeards set to starting positions. A red light will go on at any point you have to angrily shout “MISANDRY!”. So tonight, we’re looking at how victimised men are in matters of law and order - specifically, rape cases. Because, as Stand By Your Manhood argues, who are the real victims here, really? Whose lives are being ruined? Now you might say “But you actually are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law”, and yes, you’d be right to say so, but stick with this. He’s going somewhere. By the way, if you’re wondering at any point will there be any consideration given to the actual people who have been raped then the answer is no. Just so we’re clear. Hrrrrrmmmmmm. In 2013, the CPS did a study over a 17 month period, to see how many rape allegations turned out to be false. Here’s a quote from the Guardian story about the study: “The study released on Wednesday by the Crown Prosecution Service  (CPS) reveals that during the 17-month test period – when all false  allegation cases were referred to the DPP – there were 5,651  prosecutions for rape and 111,891 for domestic violence in England and  Wales.By comparison, over the same timespan, there were only 35  prosecutions for making false allegations of rape, six for false  allegations of domestic violence and three that involved false  allegations of both rape and domestic violence.”So to run the numbers for rape alone, that’s 5,651 prosecutions in the test period, with 38 false allegations in total that involved rape. So that’s 0.67%. As in, in less than 1% of cases were allegations found to be false. But ok, moving on…So, I imagine, do the many thousands upon thousands of stories of women and men who have ACTUALLY BEEN RAPED. But like I said above, let’s keep the focus on the real victims in this whole situation, shall we? Filed under “L” for “Literally never been said by anyone, ever, ever ever ever.”LOOK WE EVEN PUT IT IN A BIGGER FONT SO IT MUST BE TRUEI know! Who do these rape charities think they are, eh? Not one has come forward! Not one! What are they doing with their time, eh? What do you mean, “Providing support to people who have been raped?”Oooookay……Right, hang on…according to two breakdowns of the figures (here and here), the numbers run roughly like this: roughly 78,000 cases of rape every year (that’s an estimate, but enough to get us started). Of those, roughly 20% actually get reported to the police. Of those, about 18% go on to be prosecuted……and of those, about 38% go from “prosecution” to “actual conviction”. Which isn’t anywhere near “two out of three”. But, when you take the total amount of convictions against reported cases, not prosecuted, the figure drops to 7.01%. Now bear in mind this is just a quick bit of maths using two sets of figures and a bit of averaging between the two (and also keeping in mind the usual caution about averages - if you stuck your head in a freezer and your feet in a roaring fire, on average you should be perfectly comfortable), but it’s not a million miles out from Harman’s “misleading” statistics.They probably don’t even give the men a single fucking THOUGHT. That’s radical Marxists for you, though. Barbarians. Riiiiiiiight. Except that the police say that anonymity hurts investigations and that naming a suspect can encourage other victims to come forward, but OK. You’re the expert.AND! As if this wasn’t enough of a slap in the face to ALL MEN EVERYWHERE, there’s something else!WHAT FRESH HELL IS THIIIIIIIS?Have “long been considered” so I don’t need to identify who. I hope you’re all taking notes, here. No magic. Again, has anyone ever actually said this? Like, ever? Riiiiiiiight…….The HIGHEST GROSSING BOX OFFICE HIT of NINETEEN EIGHTY-SEVEN. So remember, folks, as we head into our final night of this special event, now and forevermore Tom Selleck, Steve Guttenberg and Ted Danson are TRAITORS TO MEN for their VILE MISANDRIC PROPAGANDA. TOMORROW: The event concludes with, “The Way Forward”" True text

What’s that? You thought women were the ones struggling against sexism at almost every level of modern life? Oh dear dear me, no…women are fine! Women are golden! Women have the whole thing stitched up! It’s THE MEN who are in trouble! *Thanks to the Daily Mail and their serialisation of Stand By Your Manhood - a book described on Amazon as a “fearless - and frequently hilarious - bloke bible“ ** - we can delve further into the minefield that is modern life for men!Today’s subject - marriage!Redmayne again. It’s always bloody Redmayne. Now this is just being needlessly vague! Is the mobile phone in Airplane Mode? Is it using 3G or on WiFi? Are the location services turned on? Is it being used to stream video? WE NEED DETAIL HERE.That’s right, they are. Mr Right is on strike, ladies! See what you’ve done now? There is still cake, though, right? You still get cake, right? You lose your friends, all respect, space, money and your sex life when you get married? All of that? In one go? Really, Doctor Smith? Really? “It’s very important that we stress that we’re not wimping out.” said THE MEN later.See, women? CAKE ONLY, WOMEN! NO EATING! JUST CAKE!“Men are….tiiiiiired. Tired of playing the gaaaame, ain’t it a cwyiiing shaaaame…”“Men don’t feel threatened by women.” *googles stories of women receiving actual threats of violence and rape and death threats for talking about computer games*Ooookay. So you would think, THE MEN are safe! Stay on that strike, fellas! BUT NO! There’s a fresh danger threatening these poor men! And once again, it’s down to YOU KNOW BLOODY WHO!DUN-DUN-DUUUUUNNNNNN!WOMEN!Yes, those predatory packs of 16-year olds, prowling the countryside, hunting down innocent MEN!It’s no laughing matter! STOP LAUGHING! ***GOD, WOMEN!It’s a conspiracy! This goes all the way to the top, you see! If only we had an overwhelming number of men in positions of power in politics! OH IF ONLY!Men. The poor, poor men. My heart is PAIN for the men. …and on that note of heartache, that’s where we’ll leave our story until tomorrow. If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story, then please GO AND FIND AND HUG A MAN BECAUSE THEY ARE HURTING WORSE THAN YOU CAN EVER EVER KNOW. TOMORROW: How we should focus on men when talking about rape, and the damage done by a piece of MISANDRIST PROPAGANDA that is still being felt almost 20 years later. * No, seriously** No, seriously *** No, seriously!"

Yes folks, it turns out that it’s a woman’s world right enough, and men are struggling to get by from day to day. Alright, so women might be able to complain about an ingrained culture of sexism, about rape culture, about lower wages, less job security, they might talk about not being able to walk home without feeling nervous or have to deal with death threats after wanting to talk about video games or rumours linking them to a job or tons of other things…but really, let’s remember that yesterday, we learned that men can be laughed at for not being able to work a washing machine.It’s called perspective, people. Look it up. Tonight, Pointless Letters is proud to thank the Daily Mail and their serialisation of Stand By Your Manhood, which allows us to delve even deeper into this troubled world of ours, where men struggle just to live their lives…That’s where we left things on Night One, with the Stiletto of Sexism aimed squarely at the heart of all men everywhere. Tonight, speaking of hearts, let’s have a look at how men are looked after in the healthcare system, shall we? A medical matriarchy! Male life is cheap! It’s strong stuff, folks, and a sobering thought for all men everywhere. Suddenly, all those Carry On movies with Hattie Jacques as Matron take on a sinister edge. That’s right! Whose money are they using for all this? Whose wallet is it all coming out of? THE MEN. THAT’S WHO. THE MEN. And if you - or, in the example above, your son - survive the CHAMBER OF HORRORS that is the modern matriarchal NHS, then you’re automatically BRANDED as a SEX OFFENDER on planes! Your daughter isn’t, oh no, not even if she has previous noncey form! No, she’s fine! But the MISANDRIC POWERS THAT BE - OR SHOULD I SAY POWERS THAT SHE - WILL MOVE YOUR SON BECAUSE HE’S LABELLED AS A SEX OFFENDER!They’ve even got the judges on their side! Is there nowhere men can turn in Britain today? Have women really got it all stitched up? And yet, in some ways, men only have themselves to blame…for their hearty support of women, men have been diminished, ridiculed, cheapened and BETRAYED!Quick nod to “the girls” having some issues too, but that’s enough of that, back to THE MEN!What do men have? Well, except for the incredible inbuilt advantage of having the vast majority of people in positions of power and influence also being men, that is? What do men have?NOBODY. That’s who men have. FUCK ALL. Truly, men are the dispossessed, the forgotten, the oppressed. Give me your huddled male masses, yearning to be free…What men need, you see, is some sort of men’s version of feminism…perhaps something to highlight men’s rights. Some sort of activism, maybe? Something to remind the world that men EXIST, because everyone talks about the women, don’t they? Oh, hey! What if these brave men’s rights activists maybe wore something? Like a hat? But what would we call these brave souls, these tireless fighters for the cause of the men? Wait for it….Waaaaait for iiiiiiit…..BOOM. Nailed it. On that hopeful, fedora-tipping note, we will leave it there, readers! Come back tomorrow night for Night Three, which will look at the thorny subject of…MAWAAAAAAAGE!" True text

Be prepared to cry. What you are about to read is truly, truly heartbreaking*. First of all, here’s a wee graphic the Daily Mail prepared just to set the scene. It’s subtle. The Daily Mail is serialising a book called Stand By Your Manhood, which is being billed as “Part blistering polemic, part politically incorrect road map for the modern man.” Because you see, it turns out that in this brave and bold Britain of 2015, the real victims? MEN! Who knew?THE DAILY MAIL KNEW, THAT’S WHO. And the author of the book. Obviously. Seriously. No laughing at the back, there. MEN ARE BRILLIANT. Fedoras to triumphant position A, please!The modern world? ALL MEN. We’ve won wars! Against other men! Which means that some men lost! Except that…err….that is….MEN!Literally there has never been a worse time to be a man. In all the history of the world. Eye-opener, isn’t it? 2015. Worst time to be a man in the history of…well, man. “Fascism - okay, it’s evil, but look how fashionable!”What, washing machines? Mocking laughter? Both? WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT MEN INVENTED!Please tip your fedoras to angry position A……and there, readers, is where we will leave it for tonight, with the stiletto of sexism squarely aimed at the hearts of ALL MEN EVERYWHERE! TOMORROW: Healthcare, “medical matriarchy” and fighting the corner for MEN!              * This may be a lie" True text

Can you? I am capable of the act, yes. Then you should. May I? The answer to that is also yes. My mother told me that violence was never the answer. My mother told me I was handsome; you can’t always listen to your mother. What happened to letting the other guy throw the first punch? Nazis don’t throw the first punch. Nazis burn the first Reichstag. Aren’t the Left supposed to be the tolerant ones? Supposed to be the smart ones, too, but they keep falling for that “I  thought you were supposed to be the tolerant ones” horseshit. What about dialogue? Dialogue is for reasonable people acting in good faith. Dialogue is  between two acceptable positions. “Taxes need to be raised” vs. “taxes  need to be lowered” is grounds for dialogue. “Taxes need to be raised”  vs. “Jews should be thrown in ovens” is grounds for a beating. But isn’t this sinking to their level? That depends. After you punch the Nazi, do you espouse the tenets of National Socialism? No. Then you’re better than a Nazi. But doesn’t this just give the other side ammunition? The other side in this argument are lying fucks who can twist any  piece of information into a swastika-shaped balloon animal if you engage  them in good faith; lacking a piece of information, they’ll just make  shit up. Might as well punch a Nazi. What about peace, love, and understanding? Great goals, and once we get rid of the Nazis we can get to work on  them. All three are completely impossible when Nazis are about. When should you punch a Nazi? Whenever you get a chance. Preferably when they’re not looking. What if they’re smaller than you? Hit them with your fist. What if they’re bigger? Hit them with a bat. Isn’t this a slippery slope? After we defeated the Nazis in World War II, did we keep shooting people or did the troops come home and start having babies? The second thing. There you go. The slippery slope argument is nine times out of ten  bullshit. Human beings are good with slippery slopes: we build stairs. What if you think you’re punching a Nazi, but you just hit a white guy with a shitty haircut? Run. What should you do if you hit a Nazi? You should run then, too. Don’t get me wrong: punching Nazis is still illegal. We’re discussing morality. But I don’t want to punch anyone. Then get off your duff, mister, and give aid and support to the boys on the front lines. We’re all in this together. Again. " False link

So many questions from this letter, the main one being: SWEET JESUS, what sort of meatgrinder of a school did John get sent to - was it the one that inspired the Hunger Games or Battle Royale? The second one is “Was this the PE teacher?”   John doesn’t seem to express any concern at this worrying mortality rate: in fact he says his school was “sensible and less rule-run” than they are today. Unless they were using machine guns as a motivational aid in PE, there’s no way so many should be shuffling off the mortal coil during lessons." False link

I’m sure it will be a good development for some but I think you’re missing the point of the article writer! No, I followed the point of the article, thank you :-) But ultimately if someone doesn’t agree with another Poirot book being produced the choice is there to not buy the thing. Taking things personally enough to feel motivated to write to every newspaper within shouting distance might feel good but I’d argue it’s not a strategy that is likely to result in much success! Someone on Tumblr taking the piss, yeah, but success less so! :-)“What’s this, George? Someone has written in to the paper and is unhappy? PULP ALL THE BOOKS! BURN THE MANUSCRIPT!”" False link
