Holy shit you guys  This deserves to be read, so I’m copying the article into my reblog.   Kendall explains that she was born to be a  sex slave, as her parents intentionally had her for the trafficker she  calls her “owner.” Kendall says that her parents sold her at birth to an  elite pedophile ring that serviced some of the world’s power elite,  describing her first memories as being passed around groups of rich and  prominent men and women for them to “take turns” with her for sadistic  sexual pleasure. Making her first public appearance  after escaping from the man she calls her “owner,” Kendall describes  being forced to participate in actions that shock the conscience. She  explains that she was forced to rape children as young as 5- years-old,  and even admits to having been forced to kill a baby by the human  trafficker she describes as her “owner.”Kendall says that she can tell the difference between kids born into  sexual slavery and ones that have been kidnapped, as the ones born into  it are more docile and less upset as it is the only reality they have  ever known. When Dr. Phil asks how old she thinks she was when she was  first raped, Kendall explains that it was “before I could talk – I was used to it by the time I was 2.” She says she doesn’t even know her actual age, as she has been a sex slave her entire life, being trafficked around the globe to be molested and raped by the societal elites – including high ranking law enforcement official, major sports franchise owners and even high level U.S. politicians. She describes having birthed 3 children while in captivity, all of which have been taken from her by her owner/trafficker, and are believed by Kendall to now be child sex slaves themselves. “I was allowed to get pregnant, because men paid for that,” Kendall said. Kendall notes that the pedophiles she  came into contact with over the years were extremely wealthy – often  “pillars of the community” – with some even owning private islands or  large pieces of land. “They would buy us just to hunt us,” she said.  She recalls one of her most fearful  memories was that of the pedophiles hosting a “hunting party” on one of  their large private plots of lands, making numerous children run and  hide in fear, as they were the “prey” to be hunted. The pedophiles would  then hunt the children as they ran and hid in fear – raping and  torturing them when they were captured. The activities described by this woman  are so profoundly disturbing they can be almost hard to believe, but Dr.  Phil confirms that his team not only investigated Kendall’s case for  four months, but also consulted with law enforcement experts who  confirmed her story. Dr. Phil said he “100% believes” that she is  telling the truth. In a damning indictment of the power-elite, Kendall described how the  pedophile politicians would adorn her in designer clothes, well groomed  hair and makeup to give the appearance of class and sophistication. She  explains that she and other children were often hung from cages  suspended from the ceiling, and that they were often drugged before  being transported in the darkness of night. She claims that she was trafficked to pedophile politicians, and  taken to political parties attended by high-level politicians who used  her for their personal pleasure. The politicians always took great care  to hide what they were doing, according to Kendall, who confirmed  that there are many elite U.S. politicians that have been engaged in  raping children for many years — a reality that has consistently been  covered up and completely hidden from voters. Perhaps the reason these crimes have been so steadfastly hidden from  public view, is that high-level law enforcement officials have also been  implicated as being part of the elite pedophile network. This is just the latest case to emerge in what is now being called  #PedoGate. #PedoGate refers to an international pedophile ring composed  of politicians and other high profile societal elites. After President Trump held a press conference last month, in which he  detailed his plans to go after the victims of the “human trafficking  epidemic,” former U.S. Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney weighed in on the subject,  noting that going after child predators will lead to the downfall of  both Republicans and Democrats in the United States — as this problem  goes all the way to the top.  As the Free Thought Project has consistently pointed out, pedophilia among the global elite is rampant.  In December, we reported on the massive child sex ring that was exposed in Norway. That investigation quickly led to arrests  of “51 people, all men, (who) are so far involved in the case. 24 of  them come from Hordaland and Sogn og Fjordane. Twenty-six come from  other areas of Norway, from Southeast to Finnmark in the north. Among  the accused offenders, there is also one Swedish national. Two  politicians, one Labor politician from Oslo and a former national  Progress Party (FrP) politician from Eastern Norway are involved in the  case.” One is also a kindergarten teacher, and four of the 51 arrested  were perpetrators in the video evidence collected. In February, the Free Thought Project reported on the fact that the police chief recently came forward and confirmed that the former Prime Minister of England, Sir Edward Heath, had raped dozens of children. The department also noted how those within the government helped cover up these crimes. We previously reported on the high-profile elite pedophilia scandal that gripped the U.K.  – with its thousands of victims – being unceremoniously swept under the  rug, which is indicative of the scope and breadth of the actual  problem. In fact, the problem is so rampant in England that officials  issued an order last month to stop naming streets and landmarks after  local heroes and politicians because they could later be exposed as  pedophiles. In the case of the U.K. Inquiry, historical abuse by politically connected elites, celebrities, and politicians was brought to light  — with an official inquiry being started — only to have the inquiry  “crumble” after heavy pressure was exerted by highly placed power  brokers within the U.K. establishment. This was almost the exact same scenario as what took place in the United States in what became known as the Franklin child sex ring coverup  — which involved high level Republicans during the George H.W. Bush  administration. Once the FBI took over the investigation from state  authorities, it turned into a witch hunt to persecute the child victims –  going so far as to charge them with perjury in a successful attempt to  scare the other 70+ victims to recant their testimony regarding the  child sex ring. While the story received a small  measure of newspaper coverage, there was a complete blackout of the  scandal by the mass media, thus most Americans have never heard about  this scandal that reached all the way to the White House. Domestically, there are relatively few high-level arrests, as anytime  ‘the elite’ are mentioned alongside the term ‘pedophile,’ the  Praetorian guard, aka the corporate media, shout down all those who dare  pose any questions about those in power abusing the most vulnerable  among us. For example former U.S. Speaker of the House of Representatives, Dennis Hastert, a known serial child rapist, was never charged for his numerous crimes against children, which the FBI knew about, and had evidence of, for over a decade. According to FBI whistleblower Sibel Edmonds: Since 1996 the FBI has had tons of information on Hastert  which was gathered in Chicago by the FBI’s Chicago Field Office. The  incriminating criminal evidence in those files range from bribery,  extortion, fraud, money laundering and embezzlement, to sexual crimes  against minors and participation in foreign-operated drug operations. Since 1997 the FBI has had much hard evidence on Hastert gathered by  the FBI’s Washington Field Office. The documented deeds range from  espionage to foreign bribery. But that’s not all. The FBI also has had hard data on Hastert’s  sexual violations outside the United States. The involved countries  include Vietnam, Thailand, Turkey and Morocco, among others. This also  included sexual favors as means of foreign bribery. Interestingly, the  CIA had been documenting those sexual activities for many years, and not  only on Hastert but on many others; elected and appointed. So, when corporate media tells you #PizzaGate is fake news and that  investigating whether Denny Hastert’s good friend, John Podesta, is  involved in some way with pedophilia – given his close friendship with  Hastert, proclivity for strange art featuring nude children and strange  code words found in his leaked emails — it shouldn’t be shouted down as  “fake news,” but investigated instead. It seems that American politicians and their political cronies are  virtually untouchable in the ivory towers of government. Since January  of 2017 over 1,500 pedophiles and human traffickers have been arrested.  However, the power-elite operating these child sexual slavery rings have  not been among them… yet.  Here are the YouTube videos embedded in the article:   Woman Claims Parents Sold Her To An International Sex Trafficking Organization – At Birth – The Dr. Phil Show   Woman Claims Parents Sold Her To Sex Trafficker And Said ‘It Was The Best Thing For Me’    – The Dr. Phil Show  Reported Human Trafficking Survivor Claims She Was Forced To Have Sex Before She Could Talk – The Dr. Phil Show   Why A Reported Survivor Of Sex Trafficking Claims She Was ‘Allowed’ To Get Pregnant Multiple Times – The Dr. Phil Show   Reported Survivor Of Human Trafficking Ring Claims Some Clients ‘Would Buy Us Just To Hunt Us’ – The Dr. Phil Show   Dr Phil - March 21, 2017 - Child Trafficking Victim Comes Forward – The Silentist (full show, 42 min) BLOW THIS UP AND BURN IT ALL DOWN.

The survey, conducted by Ipsos, gathered responses from the girls and young women aged 15-19 in all states and territories.In the survey report, entitled Don’t send me that pic, participants reported that online sexual abuse and harassment were becoming a normal part of their everyday interactions. And while the behavior seemed so common, more than 80% said it was unacceptable for boyfriends to request naked images.” “Some see sex only in terms of performance, where what counts most is the boy enjoying it. I asked a 15-year-old about her first sexual experience. She replied: “I think my body looked OK. He seemed to enjoy it.” Many girls seem cut off from their own sense of pleasure or intimacy. The main marker of a “good” sexual encounter is only if he enjoyed it. Girls and young women are under a lot of pressure to give boys and men what they want, to become a real life embodiment of what the boys have watched in porn, adopting exaggerated roles and behaviors and providing their bodies as mere sex aids. Growing up in today’s porn culture, girls quickly learn that they are service stations for male gratification and pleasure.When asked, “How do you know a guy likes you?,” an 8th grade girl replied: “He still wants to talk to you after you [give him oral sex].” A male high school student said to a girl: “If you [give me oral sex] I’ll give you a kiss.” Girls are expected to provide sex acts for tokens of affection, and are coached through it by porn-taught boys. A 15-year-old girl said she didn’t enjoy sex at all, but that getting it out of the way quickly was the only way her boyfriend would stop pressuring her and watch a movie. 7th grade girls are increasingly seeking help on what to do about requests for naked images. Receiving texts like “send me a picture of your tits” is an almost daily occurrence for many young girls. The girl asks: “How do I say no without hurting his feelings?””   WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK? You know what is sad? I am not surprised. We are raised to think of the guy’s feelings before thinking of our own boundaries and personhood. UGH UGH.  I really don’t think people realize what a problem this is. I know for instance, my mom doesn’t understand what it’s like dealing with porn sick men. How much sex has changed due to it. " False link

But then came Vantablack. Earlier this year, Kapoor sparked outrage from artists all over the world with the announcement that he had made a deal to become the only person in the world allowed to use the blackest pigment of black paint ever developed. Known as Vantablack, the unique carbon nanotube-based pigment is produced solely by a British company called NanoSystem, and was originally developed for military technologies. However, Kapoor made an agreement with the company that he is the only person allowed to use it for artistic purposes. Needless to say, that made plenty of other artists furious. “When I first heard that Anish had the exclusive rights to the blackest black I was really disappointed,” artist Stuart Semple tells Kevin Holmes for The Creators Project. “I was desperate to have a play with it in my own work and I knew lots of other artists who wanted to use it too. It just seemed really mean-spirited and against the spirit of generosity that most artists who make and share their work are driven by.” Like Kapoor, Semple’s work often uses vivid shades of color, and for years he had worked with scientists to develop increasingly intense pigments to use in his artwork. So as a response to Kapoor’s exclusive deal with Vantablack, Semple decided to release his own special pigment, known simply as “Pink,” the Irish Examiner reports.  While “Pink” isn’t based on nanotechnology, like Vantablack, Semple says it is the pinkest pink pigment ever created. Now, in an effort to thumb his nose at Kapoor, Semple is making it for sale to everyone in the world—except Kapoor, Tom Power reports for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation’s Q. i am living have you ever been this petty    😂😂😂  i am sobbing  By adding this product to your cart you confirm that you are not Anish Kapoor, you are in no way affiliated to Anish Kapoor, you are not purchasing this item on behalf of Anish Kapoor or an associate of Anish Kapoor. To the best of your knowledge, information and belief this paint will not make it’s way into that hands of Anish Kapoor.  can you imagine  Sounds about right " False link

But so much has been written about me and people never know what’s right and what’s wrong. I’d rather let them stay confused.” — Prince, 2004 Corey Tollefson (Minneapolis-based entrepreneur and fan; attended events at Paisley Park for over 20 years): The thing that was funny was you never saw Prince [ﬁrst], you smelled him. He always smelled like lavender. And you knew when he was there because you’d turn around and go, “Holy shit, I smell Prince.” And then, ten seconds later, you’d see him. Kandace Springs (singer; befriended by Prince via Twitter after he discovered her cover of a Sam Smith song online in 2014): He smelled like lavender. Dude, I’m not even kidding you. Overtime. My sister burns lavender in my house and I’m, “Oh God, it smells like Paisley Park.” That’s Prince. Maya Washington (photographer; befriended by Prince after he discovered her online in 2014): Before you meet him, you have the idea of him being this thing:He’s untouchable, he’s a unicorn, he’s a meta-planet. So the ﬁrst thing I was taken aback by, and a lot of people are taken aback by, is his size. Because I’m short, I’m ﬁve three…and he’s shorter than me. But, that aside, he is a unicorn. He’s somehow ﬂoating when he’s talking. Morris Hayes (keyboard player; Prince’s longest-serving band member, 1992–2012): I remember taking him to the hardware store in my camping van. He wanted to go buy a lock. And we go to Ace Hardware—it’s snowing and freezing—and I say, “Okay, Prince, you stay in the car.” So I’m picking stuff up in the aisles, I look over, he just cruises by in a turtleneck sweater and his fuzzy boots, and people are looking like, “Oh my God, Prince is in the hardware store!” He comes and ﬁnds me and he’s got a handful of crap—like, “Can we buy this?” I’m, “What did you do with the car?” He says, “It’s out there—it’s just running.” I said, “Prince, you can’t leave the car running—somebody could just steal the car.” He said, “This is Chanhassen—nobody’s gonna steal the car.” So we get out to the car and sure enough it’s out there, just running, smoke coming out of the tailpipe. And he’s like, “I told you.” Carmen Electra (dancer and singer; discovered by Prince in 1991): He never slept—he couldn’t sleep. I would wake up alone: Where’d he go? And his housekeeper said, “He’s in the studio.” Or he would leave the sweetest little notes on the stairs that would say: “Had to work! Couldn’t sleep. Come see me.” Springs: I saw his room and all that. His room was so small compared with everything I saw. You’d never expect him to live there. It was kinda homey—he had this little queen-size bed, and a huge-ass TV, like a 52-inch ﬂatscreen. He had a little private bathroom right there, a big-ass bathtub in there, and fake palm trees and a tan-colored ﬂoor—doing a little beach look. I saw his bathroom because I left my hair dryer at the hotel and I needed to do my Afro for the show, and he let me use his hair dryer. Misty Copeland (principal dancer at American Ballet Theatre; appeared in a Prince video and live performances): He never called from a number you’d recognize, so you’d never know it was going to be him. Loved to speak in different accents—British and French…everything. Sometimes I’d be, “Who is this?” It would go on for a while, and then ﬁnally he’d laugh and it would be him. Van Jones: (political activist; met Prince after he tried to make a sizable donation to Jones’s charitable organization anonymously): He always said the same thing whenever he was getting on the phone: “This is Prince.” Not “How are you doing?” Not “What’s up?” Kind of low: “This is Prince.” " False link
