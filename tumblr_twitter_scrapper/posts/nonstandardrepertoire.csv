In the eyes of the generation of composers who emerged after the war, the only way forward was to question the entire history of music up until that point and to reinvent music. As such, modernism in music is a phenomenon that can be understood in cyclical historical terms. It is another matter altogether that the chosen path proved to be the wrong one. It was hardly wise to respond to the shattering of the world by shattering music, which is one of the greatest achievements of humankind.Modernism soon became a totalitarian ideology … From today’s perspective, we may ask: why tear everything down when the only thing that it would achieve was that everything would be broken?like … . yikes on so many levelsnot only is the history wrong — it’s p unarguable that Modernism in music is in full swing by the end of the First World War, and there are compelling arguments to push it back as far as the 1890s — this is such an unfortunate misreading of what many of the Modernists were trying to do? i know that, like, a lot of 20th Century High Modernist Art Music is bristly and prickly and dissonant and difficult to listen to, but there are schools of thought within Modernist composition that are breathtakingly utopian in their goals and beliefs in music’s possibilities. it didn’t always pan out that way — if you’ve read anything i’ve written about Schoenberg and early serialism you know that i think those hopes were overly optimistic — but that doesn’t mean the entire Modernist project was a pessimistic rampage of destruction, and i find it equal parts flabbergasting and infuriating that someone could be paid to write something so breathtakingly ill-informed(this also leaving aside the all of the aesthetic judgements that are baked into this paragraph — by all means, like what you like, but don’t make the mistake of conflating “music that you like” with “objectively good music that all other styles are a threat to or deviation from”. and like … “shattering music, … one of the greatest achievements of humankind” sure seems to take a p blinkered approach to what “music” is — serialists (which … seems to be what this author (Jouni Kaipainen) means by “modernists”?) weren’t exactly heavy influencers in any musical idiom outside Western Art Music and arguably some film and cabaret music via German Expressionism, but like … debatable whether that’s rlly serialism qua, tbh)and also just … these are liner notes for Aulis Sallinen. Aulis Sallinen is not a tonal composer. he may not write using the same processes as Boulez, but Modernism is 5000% at play in his music. like literally what the fuck do you think you’re talking about" True text

Pujol was a chicken farmer. Pujol hated him some goddamn fascists.    See Spain had recently ended its civil war, with the fascists taking power. So when WWII broke out in Europe, Spain technically remained neutral but in practice was buddy buddy with the Nazis. Juan Pujol Garcia thought this was pretty bullshit  so soon after war breaks out Pujol travels to his local British embassy and goes “hey I wanna spy on the Nazis for you”  “who the fuck are you?” say the British, and kick him out  but Pujol is not deterred! He still wants to dunk on some fascists, so now he goes to his local German embassy instead. “hey” he says, “I wanna spy on the British for you, I sure do hate them”  “yeah okay” say the Germans “that seems pretty legit”  and just like that Pujol now officially works for the Abwehr, the German intelligence agency. They hand him some spy gear (invisible ink and such) and instruct him to travel to Lisbon, and from there make his way into the UK. So Pujol heads to Lisbon, and a little while later writes to his German handlers telling them he’s made it to England  Pujol had not made it to England. He had, in fact, made it to the Lisbon public library, where he checked out a number of English guide books and set about just wholesale making shit up  this is slightly complicated by the fact that, for example, he completely did not understand British currency and all his expense reports were basically gibberish. He also reported things like bribing Scotsmen, because the people of Glasgow would “do anything for a litre of wine” (an actual quote) because, hey, people in Spain like wine so that’s probably the same right?    Here is where it starts to get really crazy, because the Abwehr loves this. “wow this dude is a great spy” they say, because apparently none of them had ever been the England either. In fact, they are so pumped about this new awesome spy that the British start to get worried  you see, by this time the British had cracked German’s supposedly unbreakable Enigma code and were totally dunking on the Nazis by reading basically all of their ~super top secret~ radio transmissions. And, crucially, they’d become so good at breaking and reading traffic that there were literally no German spies in England. The Germans would set up a spy drop (usually dropping dudes in by parachute in the middle of the night), the British would intercept the message and then just scoop the dudes up as soon as they landed in a move that must have been SUPER embarrassing to the spies  so there are no German spies in the UK because they’re all sitting in a prison run by MI5 (although some are being run under supervision as double agents, feeding Germany bullshit). But suddenly MI5 is picking up all this traffic from the Germans talking about their super great spy- a spy the British do not have in their jail  “oh shit” says MI5, and starts rereading all the transmissions they have to and from this mysterious super spy.  “hey wait” says MI5, upon actually reading the shit the spy was sending. “someone is playing silly buggers, pip pip cheerio”  At this point, Pujol, still in Lisbon, had actually been approaching the British embassy again, repeatedly, but apparently “I am literally an Abwehr agent and would like to offer you my services” wasn’t interesting enough, because he was repeatedly turned away, again. It wasn’t until MI5 started asking around that one of the embassy staff was like “oh yeah we know that guy”  so in 1942 the British finally make contact with Pujol and he officially becomes a spy for MI5. They move him to London and assign him a case officer so he can start making up even better bullshit  and he does. Once actually in London, Pujol reports to the Abwehr that he’d recruited a whole slew of informants- from a bunch of Welsh Aryans to disaffected army officers. He ends up with a network of 20+ sub-spies, all feeding him information from around the UK  none of these people actually exist  Pujol just straight up invented like 20 people, keeping careful track of their fake personalities, names, and activities. With the help of MI5, the information he sends becomes even better- a mix of true but ultimately useless facts and actually important intel timed to arrive in Germany just slightly too late to be of any use. He and his “spy network” become the Abwehr’s most trusted agents  Pujol, now codenamed Agent Garbo (for his acting skills), ends up playing a huge role in the run-up to D-Day, where the Allies mounted a huge intelligence campaign to convince Hitler that the planned site of attack was going to be Calais and not Normandy (this was Operation Fortitude and you should absolutely look it up for more Wacky WWII Adventures). Obviously you know how this ended  crazily enough, the Abwehr never figured out that Pujol was a double agent. After the war he received both the Iron Cross Second Class (which require personal authorization from Hitler), and a Member of the Order of the British Empire (from King George VI)  unable to resist being totally fucking ridiculous, Pujol turned down MI5’s post-war offer to continue spying, but this time against the USSR. “no,” he said “just help me fake my own death and then I’m moving to Venezuela”  and that’s exactly what he did. Juan Garcia Pujol died in 1988, at the age of 76  Okay I’m just editing my reblog to add this picture of Juan Pujol Garcia because I feel that it adds so much to the story to picture him doing ALL THE ABOVE with this expression: What a legend.  #rose what if i played HIM in timewatch Um yes I encourage this.

(this is a ranking of priorities i can get behind)services were gender-segregated, with women on the ground floor and men in the balconies. but catcalling and its equivalents had already been invented (ugh), so many of the young men would throw paper airplanes and other small objects from the balcony down to the ground floor in the hopes of getting the attention of the ladieslots of stray dogs running around doing their thing (most of them probably not neutered/spayed!)so yes in short had they know about electricity they could have had an infinite supply just from Martin Luther spinning in his grave" True text

Since then, Pulse has been promoting awareness about the LGBTQ community in the area. “Being raised in a strict Italian family, being gay was frowned upon. However, when John came out to his family and friends, the family dynamic transitioned from a culture of strict tradition to one of acceptance and love,” Pulse’s website says. “It was important to create an atmosphere that embraced the gay lifestyle with décor that would make John proud.

Several have lost their homes and belongings to the fire, while others even left behind their pets as they escaped under a mandatory evacuation order. Here are some of the ways to help those affected: Donate money online: The Red Cross has started an emergency appeal for help. To donate $5 by phone, text REDCROSS to 30333. The Alberta government said Wednesday it will match donations to the Red Cross. The Wood Buffalo Food Bank is accepting donations through PayPal on its website. The Salvation Army is also collecting financial donations online. Emergency shelter: Airbnb has activated its Disaster Response Tool to help provide free shelter until May 21. Residents in nearby areas can list their properties on the website. Those able to provide accommodations can also sign up on website YMMfire.ca. Displaced pets: The Fort McMurray SPCA is working to reunite displaced residents with pets they were forced to leave behind. They are accepting donations to help efforts. The Edmonton Humane Society is preparing to accept animals left without owners, and provide temporary shelter to pets with owners who have left their homes. Social media efforts: Facebook group Fort Mac Fire Donations is crowdsourcing donations for items such as toiletries, socks and pillows, as needed. On Twitter, people are offering help through hashtags such as #ymmfire and #ymmhelp  Hey could you guys signal boost this, please? :) There’s a huge wildfire in a city in my province and it’s evacuated 88,000 people, there have already been 1,600 buildings destroyed and apparently tonight it’s supposed to get even worse. The province of Alberta is now officially in a state of emergency. Please signal boost, it would mean a lot to me! <3 Here is a video someone took while evacuatingHere are some photos of the fire: [x] [x] [x]  Hey, so, this fire grew in size by about 850% in the last 24 hours. It’s now 85,000 hectares. An official sports field is generally about 1 hectare in size, to give you a better idea how big 85,000 hectares is.  Another example: My city, Edmonton, is 68,440 hectares in size. That fire is bigger than my entire city.  Please signal boost this. Fort McMurray is going to need all the help they can get to recover from this devastation.   In the uncertainty and chaos and stress that’s come out of this… I keep hearing things that are both stunning and yet seem oddly simple and commonplace.  Like: Syrian refugees raising money to assist with Fort McMurray evacuees. Donations coming in from   Lac-Mégantic.  (context: Lac-Megantic’s downtown was destroyed by a train derailment and explosion three years ago) Spontaneous convoys heading up to supply evacuees with gas, water, and essentials. Support from NHL and CFL teams. Concerts.  Wedding receptions.  Pancake breakfasts.  Music singles.  All giving donations and proceeds to help evacuees.   It happened during the Edmonton tornado in 1987, it happened during the 2011 Slave Lake fire, and it happened during the 2013 Southern Alberta floods (and these are just the ones I can think of off the top of my head, the ones I remember).  People always help.  This post has slowed down a bit recently. The fort McMurray fire may no longer be a current threat to the city but over 2000 buildings were destroyed. The city is still off limits to the public; it’s 80,000+ residents are still displaced. They still need a lot of support. " False link

Some of you can make it up, others only “see” a beach they’ve visited. Some of you have to work harder to paint the canvas. Some of you can’t hang onto the canvas for long. But nearly all of you have a canvas. I don’t. I have never visualized anything in my entire life. I can’t “see” my father’s face or a bouncing blue ball, my childhood bedroom or the run I went on ten minutes ago. I thought “counting sheep” was a metaphor.

The student scooped up  a palm-sized clump of wet clay, formed a disc about the size and shape  of a hamburger, and let it dry down a bit in the sun.  On the surface of  the moist clay the student drew a diagram that showed the people of the  Old Babylonian Period (1,900–1,700 B.C.E.) fully understood the  principles of the “Pythagorean Theorem”  1300 years before Greek geometer Pythagoras was born, and were also  capable of calculating the square root of two to six decimal places. 	    … The tablet, formally known as YBC 7289, “Old Babylonian Period  Mathematical Text,” came to Yale in 1909 as part of a much larger  collection of cuneiform tablets assembled by J. Pierpont Morgan and  donated to Yale. In the ancient Mideast cuneiform writing was created by  using a sharp stylus pressed into the surface of a soft clay tablet to  produce wedge-like impressions representing pictographic words and  numbers. Morgan’s donation of tablets and other artifacts formed the  nucleus of the Yale Babylonian Collection, which now incorporates 45,000  items from the ancient Mesopotamian kingdoms.      The importance of the geometry tablet was first recognized by science  historians Otto Neugebauer and Abraham Sachs in their 1945 book  “Mathematical Cuneiform Texts.” “Ironically, mathematicians today are much more fascinated with the  Babylonians’ ability to accurately calculate irrational numbers like the  square root of two than they are with the geometry demonstrations,”  notes associate Babylonian Collection curator Agnete Lassen. “The Old Babylonian Period produced many tablets that show complex  mathematics, but it also produced things you might not expect from a  culture this old, such as grammars, dictionaries, and word lists,” says  Lassen “One of the two main languages spoken in early Babylonia  was  dying out, and people were careful to document and save what they could  on cuneiform tablets. It’s ironic that almost 4,000 years ago people  were thinking about cultural preservation, and actively preserving their  learning for future generations.”.  " False link
