My family is going through tough times, even if my mom it’s working is hard to maintaining household expenses, and I want to help her, I can’t get a proper job at the moment because college doesn’t allow me the time to do it, she is always stressed and worried and I don’t like seeing her like that.Also I can’t afford the proper equipment I need for my college, a friend did me the huge favor of lending me his computer, but I need one for me, also my tablet is old and is failing me. I don’t do this for compassion, I just want to help my family somehow.In the future I will open more commissions, but at the moment I would really appreciate it if you can support me through ko-fi. " True text
