Block them on sight. This is MANIPULATION. Period.  Thank you for saying this Yonder, this has become a rather large issue as of late. And to those saying “it’s not tricking people to ask them to draw that stuff”ActuallyYes it is. When I was 15 on deviantart someone asked me to draw a character with its paws exposed, I happily did so because I went “aww that’s cute there is no harm in that”.But then I found out the person had a “paw fetish” and began spreading it onto rather dirty websites and stuff of that nature.For a bit after that I was SPAMMED BY PEOPLE WITH PAW FETISHES FOR MONTHS.I WAS 15 YEARS OLD AND I HAD 27+ YEAR OLD MEN SPAM ME WITH FETISH ART OR TELLING ME HOW SEXY MY CHRACTERS PAWS WERE.It was sick and twisted to do that to a minor or to anyone. Hell even when I first joined the ask community as a minor I learned about a “slime fetish” that I was often tricked into drawing.Got invited unknowingly into chatrooms that spammed “slime fetish porn”. Got spammed with messages and photos of porn involving slime.To this day I’m still somewhat messed up by it and I am too afraid to draw anything slime covered or gooeyHell I STILL GET PEOPLE SUBMITTING THAT STUFF TO ME OR SPAMMING ME WITH STUFF. I do not care what you beat your meat to.I don’t care. Whatever floats your scrote dude. I’m sure we all have our own things that get us randy. It’s perfectly fine to be into things!! But to trick UNKNOWING MINORS (or anyone) into drawing that for you?Is wrong. I don’t care who you are. It is wrong to trick others into drawing fetish stuff for you. Please be safe everyone. Especially you minors.I hope you guys don’t get tricked into things and have to go through what I have been through one too many times.Take care of yourselves. " False text

This isn’t having a short attention span (or well maybe thats part of it), but probably something called “Optimal Arousal.”(This is psychology, not anatomy, please keep your mind out of the gutter Xp) Optimal Arousal goes like this: When effort is low, more stimulus is better. When effort is high, less stimulus is better.  I’ll elaborate. Whenever you do something easy (like maybe some homework as an example), unless something else is happening (like music or a show) you tend to get drawn away or doze off. In this homework scenario, the effort is low, so in order to keep at it and do well on working on it, you need a higher amount of stimulus, like a movie. If something is hard, like for instance a test, you probably will try to avoid noise, going so far as to hush others so you can concentrate. The effort is high so you want less stimulus. Keep this in mind. It can help you focus, and make life a lot easier. Dont feel bad for doing lots of different things while you are just chillin. Enjoy the knowledge! " False text

The same is true if you possess hundreds of millions of dollars, or even millions of dollars. Being extremely wealthy is impossible to justify in a world containing deprivation. Even though there is a lot of public discussion about inequality, there seems to be far less talk about just how patently shameful it is to be rich. After all, there are plenty of people on this earth who die—or who watch their loved ones die—because they cannot afford to pay for medical care. There are elderly people who become homeless because they cannot afford rent. There are children living on streets and in cars, there are mothers who can’t afford diapers for their babies. All of this is beyond dispute. And all of it could be ameliorated if people who had lots of money simply gave those other people their money. It’s therefore deeply shameful to be rich. It’s not a morally defensible thing to be.  " False link

This is not the case.  “I love cats,” he says, calling them  “fascinating, magnificent animals,” that seem to have a “freakish love  for me.” He’s even considered a pet cat, despite being mildly allergic.  “This is the thing people don’t realize,” Marra told me recently at a  café near his office in Washington, D.C. “I’m both a wild animal  advocate and a domestic animal advocate. If my mother thought I wasn’t  supporting cats, she’d be flipping in her grave.” It’s an understandable mistake. After all, Marra has made himself  the public face of what sounds a lot like an anti-cat crusade. For  years, the wildlife ecologist has been investigating the lethal implications of cats and urging that pet owners keep them indoors.  Now, he argues in Cat Wars: The Devastating Consequences of a Cuddly Killer,  co-authored with freelance writer Chris Santella, the time has come  for more drastic action: a concerted, nationwide effort to rid the  landscape of cats. (The book is based on Marra’s personal and scientific  research, and the views and conclusion are expressly his own and do not  represent those of the Smithsonian Institution)…  Keep your cats inside for their health and the environment.  (This goes for UK people and everyone else too. Sick and tired of people from other countries trying to insist this is just a US problem. Your cats kill wildlife too​, and they still face plenty of dangers.)  Can’t do that for now, might consider it once my current cats are gone (in about 20 years…). It’s cruel to just lock them up. But just saying, all the indoor cats I know are incredibly frustrated and destructive. It’s no coincidence that in all those years of having indoor/outdoor cats, none have been sick and all have lived past 20 while the indoor ones are just a massive pile of trouble. It’s probably just bad owners, no stimulation, too many cats in a house, stress and bad food. But still, I’m no miracle owner and my cats are very content sitting in the sun. Outside.  “It’s cruel to just lock them up……incredibly frustrated and destructive.” hey uhh, someone come arrest me. I’ve heavily documented my abuse of these innocents: you argue that (& I’m rephrasing for clarity) ‘folk who hoard cats without providing them with adequate enrichment/quality food have unhappy animals, therefore indoor cats=cruelty’, without addressing the MASSIVE environmental damge outdoor cats cause daily, OR how we’ve managed to culturally accept indoor dogs, indoor hamsters, indoor budgies, & indoor geckos…..but somehow can’t get past the barrier of indoor cats (hint: it’s bc indoor cats are more work) from an animal welfare standpoint, outdoor cats don’t meet the Five Freedoms: 1. freedom from hunger/thirst, 2. freedom from discomfort, 3. freedom from pain/injury/disease, or 5. freedom from fear/distress. indoor cats fulfill all five.

a-seriousgamer 159947818050 "2017-04-24 19:22:20 GMT" https://a-seriousgamer.tumblr.com/post/159947818050/genocide-denial-goes-viral-the-promise-and-the "diversemovies:  Eighty years ago the Turkish government forced Hollywood to drop a movie project based on The Forty Days of Musa Dagh, then a best-selling novel on the Armenian Genocide by German-language author, Jew and outspoken Hitler opponent Franz Werfel. The Forty Days of Musa Dagh, originally written as a warning against Hitler through the prism of the Armenian Genocide, never saw the silver screen. Such a movie could have also raised awareness of the fate of the Jews in Nazi Germany at the time and later of the ongoing Holocaust. It could have shaped the “narrative” of the struggle against Hitler. Many have since been interested to finally turn the novel into a major production, but Turkish opposition and obstruction seemed insurmountable. http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hollywood-is-losing-battle-online-trolls-992582 It had taken years — and the passionate support of Armenian activist Kirk Kerkorian, who financed the film’s $100 million budget without expecting to ever make a profit — for The Promise, a historical romance set against the backdrop of the Armenian genocide and starring Christian Bale and Oscar Isaac, to reach the screen. Producers always knew it would be controversial: Descendants of the 1.5 million Armenians killed by the Ottoman Empire shortly after the onset of World War I have long pressed for the episode to be recognized as a genocide despite the Turkish government’s insistence the deaths were not a premeditated extermination. The Promise, which opens April 21, finally would bring the untold saga to a mass audience. But at the Toronto Film Festival premiere in September, producer Mike Medavoy watched the late billionaire’s carefully laid plans upended by a digital swarm that appeared out of nowhere. Before the critics in attendance even had the chance to exit Roy Thompson Hall, let alone write their reviews, The Promise’s IMDb page was flooded with tens of thousands of one-star ratings. “All I know is that we were in about a 900-seat house with a real ovation at the end, and then you see almost 100,000 people who claim the movie isn’t any good,” says Medavoy. Panicked calls were placed to IMDb, but there was nothing the site could do. “One thing that they can track is where the votes come from,” says Eric Esrailian, who also produced the film, and “the vast majority of people voting were not from Canada. So I know they weren’t in Toronto.” The online campaign against The Promise appears to have originated on sites like Incisozluk, a Turkish version of 4chan, where there were calls for users to “downvote” the film’s ratings on IMDb and YouTube. A rough translation of one post: “Guys, Hollywood is filming a big movie about the so-called Armenian genocide and the trailer has already been watched 700k times. We need to do something urgently.” Soon afterward, the user gleefully noted The Promise’s average IMDb rating had reached a dismaying 1.8 stars. “They know that the IMDb rating will stay with the film forever,” says Esrailian. “It’s a kind of censorship, really.” " False link

We have entered a phase of regression,and one of the easiest ways to see it is in our infrastructure: our roads and bridges look more like those in Thailand or Venezuela than the Netherlands or Japan. But it goes far deeper than that, which is why Temin uses a famous economic model created to understand developing nations to describe how far inequality has progressed in the United States. The model is the work of West Indian economist W. Arthur Lewis, the only person of African descent to win a Nobel Prize in economics.  In the Lewis model of a dual economy, much of the low-wage sector has little influence over public policy. Check.  The high-income sector will keep wages down in the other sector to provide cheap labor for its businesses. Check.  Social control is used to keep the low-wage sector from challenging the policies favored by the high-income sector. Mass incarceration - check.  The primary goal of the richest members of the high-income sector is to lower taxes. Check.  Social and economic mobility is low. Check. Temin says that today in the U.S., the ticket out is education, which is difficult for two reasons: you have to spend money over a long period of time, and the FTE sector is making those expenditures more and more costly by defunding public schools and making policies that increase student debt burdens.   Even with a diploma, you will likely find that high-paying jobs come from networks of peers and relatives. Social capital, as well as economic capital, is critical, but because of America’s long history of racism and the obstacles it has created for accumulating both kinds of capital, black graduates often can only find jobs in education, social work, and government instead of higher-paying professional jobs like technology or finance— something most white people are not really aware of. Women are also held back by a long history of sexism and the burdens — made increasingly heavy — of making greater contributions to the unpaid care economy and lack of access to crucial healthcare. How did we get this way? What happened to America’s middle class, which rose triumphantly in the post-World War II years, buoyed by the GI bill, the victories of labor unions, and programs that gave the great mass of workers and their families health and pension benefits that provided security? Around 1970, the productivity of workers began to get divided from their wages. Corporate attorney and later Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell galvanized the business community to lobby vigorously for its interests. Johnson’s War on Poverty was replaced by Nixon’s War on Drugs, which sectioned off many members of the low-wage sector, disproportionately black, into prisons. Politicians increasingly influenced by the FTE sector turned from public-spirited universalism to free-market individualism. As money-driven politics accelerated (a phenomenon explained by the Investment Theory of Politics, as Temin explains), leaders of the FTE sector became increasingly emboldened to ignore the needs of members of the low-wage sector, or even to actively work against them.  Temin notes that “the desire to preserve the inferior status of blacks has motivated policies against all members of the low-wage sector.” What can we do? We’ve been digging ourselves into a hole for over forty years, but Temin says that we know how to stop digging.  If we spent more on domestic rather than military activities, then the middle class would not vanish as quickly.  The effects of technological change and globalization could be altered by political actions.  We could restore and expand education, shifting resources from policies like mass incarceration to improving the human and social capital of all Americans.  We could upgrade infrastructure, forgive mortgage and educational debt in the low-wage sector,  reject the notion that private entities should replace democratic government in directing society, and  focus on embracing an integrated American population.  We could tax not only the income of the rich, but also their capital.   We have a structure that predetermines winners and losers. We are not getting the benefits of all the people who could contribute to the growth of the economy, to advances in medicine or science which could improve the quality of life for everyone — including some of the rich people.” Along with Thomas Piketty, whose Capital in the Twenty-First Century examines historical and modern inequality, Temin’s book has provided a giant red flag, illustrating a trajectory that will continue to accelerate as long as the 20 percent in the FTE sector are permitted to operate a country within America’s borders solely for themselves at the expense of the majority.  Without a robust middle class, America is not only reverting to developing-country status, it is increasingly ripe for serious social turmoil that has not been seen in generations.
