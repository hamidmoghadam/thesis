It is obvious MM wasn’t invited to the church. This is very common. Obviously the church was tiny and could only fit about 120 people so there wouldn’t be enough room to fit everybody. You’re not going to have the partner of a friend (a.k.a your soon to be wife’s, sister’s, husband’s, brother’s, new girlfriend) you’ve never met/barely know to watch you witness your vows when you can’t invite people you are actually close to. This has nothing to do with MM being graceful, no ring no bring or MM not wanting to take the spotlight off Pippa (That would have been impossible. Pippa OWNED the day!! She was stunning!) MM simply was not invited to the church. And why on earth would she be?? She’s certainly not important in Pippa’s life. This is not a big deal. I don’t know anyone if they have limited room who would choose someone they don’t know over someone they are actually close to. That’s ridiculous. 2. Uncle Gary and his daughter going for dinner at Chiltern Firehouse because he wasn’t invited to the evening reception. - My educated guess would be that he was invited but his daughter was not. Many receptions especially as they’re an open bar, very expensive per head and will go late into the night in a very adult environment, probably have a no child policy. I know I would have. I also wouldn’t have kids under ten at the church. Even if it is a close family member i.e a niece or God child. They would need to be babysat for the evening. That really isn’t the appropriate environment for a kid to be around a bunch of drunk adults anyway. and why wouldn’t you want a child free evening? I’m guessing Uncle Gary decided to just not go as Tallulah (I think that’s his daughter name) wasn’t invited to go. They probably did go to the afternoon cocktails and canapes reception though. Once again, no big deal. 3. That is MM in the car with Harry. Anyone talking about photo shop or super imposing MM’s head onto Eugenie’s body is cray cray. You need to take your pills and stop buying into the lies on certain other blogs. She didn’t go to the church, she didn’t go to the afternoon cocktail reception immediately after the church but she did go to the evening reception. End of. Stop with the photo shop theories you’re making yourselves look like lunatics. 4. Meghan and Harry not sitting next to each other. -  In all the weddings I’ve gone to in the UK, society or not I’d say about half of them I’ve been sitting with my partner and the other half they split you up from your partner in effort to make tables mix. This is a common thing. It wasn’t done to MM specifically. If you look at many of the royal weddings, The Swedish one for examples, the royal couples and other guests never walk in with their husband/wife and are always on different tables. Anyone trying to make this into a dramatic thing or nasty thing that Pippa has done also needs to take their meds and a few less sugar pills. You also sound cray cray and like you’ve escaped from the asylum. 5. My money is on a purple dress to match the earrings and in the car pic it looked like an updo! But what was the purple stone in the earrings? And do you think they were real? 6. Rarely have I gone to a wedding in the UK when there has been a tiara tbh Less than half. Also, I haven’t read who made it and how it was described but it kind of looked a bit like a headband more than a tiara on my phone! That said. Pips can wear whatever the F she wants and all those nasties calling her names are going to lose their mind when their saint Meg the patron saint of Media Merching doesn’t get a tiara! Mwahahahahahahahahaha!!! (evil cackle!!) At the end of the day this wedding was about Pippa and James and I think they pulled that off. The only people who tried to take the spotlight away from Pippa was the press and the sugars. Any “decent minded people” (to quote Harry’s infamous statement hahaha!!) I think can see that Pippa made the right decision as far as inviting MM to the evening reception only as she is a friends girlfriend but it would have been too much to also invite her to the church. Not because of fake spotlight stealing but because she’s practically a stranger (Who quite frankly has been pushing the P.R quite hard and VERY rudely to get an invite for the whole day. Glad Pippa stuck to acceptable etiquette and not media pressure. The girl is obvs an dold hand at ignoring BS in the papers) SUBMITTED by FD anon ♥ thank you so much :D  Just agreed and thank you to everything! To #5 I’m thinking the purple thingy was a reflection in the window, on first glance it does look like an earring but the longer I look the less I’m thinking “that’s an earring”. Thank you FD ♥  Not lies, you’re guessing" False text

Because you know HM is not troubled by Megsy’s various religion changes nor her cheating on her husband and BF or her leaking fake stories to tabloids or her calling the paps all the time or her walking billboard sales events no it was because she is not demure.  But don’t worry HM the wedding can proceed cause MM is demure now.  No more kissing Harry in parking lots. Oh and all the reports put up by her pr about hats with feathers and two outfits and multiple fittings.  This is hysterical.    She just buried herself."
