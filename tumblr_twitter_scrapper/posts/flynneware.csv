Zari teleported the Brugran, Jaz, Ukri and herself to the high plateaus of Thunderbluff, much to Bru’s displeasure. Portals always made him sick to his stomach. Ukri and Jaz couldn’t contain their excitement while Bru tried no to lose his breakfast. Unfortunately for him, Zari teleported them on Thunderbluff, and not by the faire grounds.Bru feared nothing, but if… Hypothetically he did fear something, hypothetically… it would be heights. Which may, or may not have been why he refused to move once he relized where they were. Another portal and an even queasier Bru later the appeared right in front of… The Darkmoon Portal. Yes Bru, another portal.Suddenly Graumsh was there. How did he get here? He claimed he ran. It just seemed like they couldn’t get rid of him. Ukri however was tired of waiting and told his new ‘minion’ to pick up Bru and carry him through the portal. Which he did happily. Which also sadly resulted in Brugran puking on Graumsh’s tunic. Gross.They paused by the cake tent to cheer Brugran up and they ran into Volteika from an earlier adventure raiding a centaur crypt and getting crystals. She joined them after Bru regained his composure. They walked past the various stalls and stopped at the zoo part of the faire. They oo’ed and awe’ed and the many exotice animals. And even almost got in trouble with a carnie when they were about to steal eggs from a huge plains strider. Luckily the carnie was absent when Bru dared Volt five gold to ride the elekk in the pin. Like a boss she stayed on the flailing and very annoyed beast.Bru and Zari fell in love with the little elekk calves which got Brugran’s gears turning. Would they make good pack beasts? Hmm… Later Jaz tricked Graumsh into thinking there was a tiny winged pony in an empty cage and he became sad when it flew away. Poor Graumsh. So easily trusting of these people.At the end of the tour Volt left to check out other parts of the fair and Graumsh… well he fell asleep. Thankfully not in an animal pen. Ukri fell in love with a grey pony but Bru, Jaz and Zari dragged him away. But Bru did notice the connection and his wheels were turning once again. Perhaps Ukri needed his own steed, instead of riding with him all the time.The trio ended up at the arena to which Jaz gleefully just let herself in to fight a giant orc warrior. Bru knew Jaz, despite her diminutive size, was a savage fighter and was sure she’d win. Smelling a big cash out he convinced Zari to take bets from the crowd on a winner. None but Bru voted on Jaz.  Like a proud brother Bru watched the little thing maul the orc into submission and the trio earned more than enough gold to cover the failed trip in Desolace. Overall, everyone enjoyed the faire and Zari gained her money back and then some. It was a good vacation.   This was an amazing day. So much awesome times with friends!" False text

Headshots actually. Because I don’t have a tablet I was charging 10 for a sketch, 15 for ink, and 25 for coloring. I also had set up a charge for WoW gold payments too. Someone told me I was charging way too much and they could get it cheaper. I tried to explain that I was using real life resources that are finite. I.e. Colored pencils, paper, pens, etc. They were not having it. Which to me was fine. But my question to you all is, am I really overcharging or am I right in my pricing due to the expenses of good quality art supplies?  Depends on who they were comparing you to. Under-pricing is pretty rampant in the art community. That doesn’t mean you should lower your prices to match though! Goes both ways as well! Sometimes people think you charge too little but it’s all about how you value your time and resources.It’s not just supplies you need to factor in but time. If on average you are making way under minimum wage, that’s no good! Even if it’s just as a hobby you should set a minimum because it is work. No matter who tells you otherwise! Time how long it takes you, make a rough estimate of supply usage and if you send them the physical piece, add that shipping cost in too. Bam! All the info you need to calculate and set a minimum for yourself. Next is of course how much you value your own work. It’s going to be subjective. Some will think it’s amazing, others will think it’s crap. But no matter what anyone else says, your opinion is what counts. Try to strike a balance. Everyone has room for improvement but at the same time you should be proud of what you do.Now for people that try to talk you into lower prices. NEVER let anyone guilt you into lowering prices. But do ask questions. What you could do to improve or why they think you over/under charge. ((Chances are if they don’t have any feedback they just wanted to see if you would do it for less… Douchey but happens.))Overall just remember it is an investment. Sometimes it’s better to turn someone away. Try not to see it as a loss but an opportunity to work for someone else. Something that takes up 50% of your time shouldn’t be 10% of what you make!  Also remember that art is a luxury. If people are telling you that what you’re offering is too expensive, they’re most likely just trying to get cheap or free art and they don’t understand the concept of paying for a service. Because art is something that ‘anybody can do’, right? I also encourage you to increase your prices. Baki made very excellent points; definitely clock yourself and figure out how long you take on a piece. Make sure you’re charging AT LEAST the equivalent of federal minimum wage in your country, and add more to it than that. This isn’t mindless work or hard labour, it’s a creative endeavor and personalized for the client who is commissioning you. You deserve pay that is worth the effort you’re putting into your art."

I caught an incredibly ruthless stomach flu (or some other virus or something, still don’t know to this day) at the beginning of the year that caused me to miss my grandpa’s memorial service. It seemed to go away after a few weeks and then I got a cold. Colds usually stay with me for a quite a while and are an absolute bitch to get over. But it did. Then I got another flu again. Or so I thought. Beginning in February I got some sort of horrible Mystery Illness. That lasted 6 weeks, but it finally went away. I’m now on absolutely 0 medications; I quit everything. I keep a bottle of Xanax in my bag for dire situations, but I’ve avoided having to take any since March, something I’m very proud of. I’m so thankful to have my health back. We still don’t know what happened or what was wrong, but all my bloodwork came back normal and the sickness faded; I’m back to normal now. The bad news is that through some stupid bullshit loophole with Rakka’s work, I never had insurance. So we have some medical bills to care of. The bloodwork alone ended up being over $1400 for 6 labs. The grand total for the lab, doctor visit, and EKG is actually less than I expected, so I’m fortunate in that regard. It won’t take too long to pay off, but it’s still an inconvenience that I wish could have been avoided. Stupid union/Obamacare BS. We’re still waiting for our federal return to come back since there was an issue processing our information. We also need to pay off our credit debt since we mainly use it to get by in the winter when work hours are sparse. In other news, @themagicalmercantile, the guild that @datwolfmonraz and I run, is doing spectacularly well, as has roleplay in general. We kicked off to a great start at the beginning of this year and created so many new characters, and gone through so much development already. It’s been amazing. We’ve met lots of cool people, made new friends and recruited some fun people into the guild, and Raz is really something. She works so hard to plot for, plan, and host our weekly guild event. She’s really an amazing DM and puts on her game face no matter what life is throwing at the time. Go give her some love; I just work in the background in the coding and recordkeeping departments. Art is going good. I don’t have the urge to draw as much as I used to since writing is taking up about 80% of my life right now, and I’m happy with it that way. I still accept commissions once in a while, and actually have 2 right now that I’m trying to chip away at. I will be switching over to a Google Form for future commissions. Will simplify the process and keep things better organized on my side. I do plan to get back into streaming. Don’t expect it soon, I have a lot of planning and scheduling if I want to do it right. It will be mainly art things, drawing, model edits, and miniature painting. Maybe occasional casual WoW or some other game, but mostly art. Lastly, I want to keep going with the anime club that @deeafrotailmisstress and I started. It will also take a lot of planning. Maybe a club night once or twice a month would work. We’ll figure something out! That’s your obligatory life update from me. Stay cool my dudes! " True text
flynneware 159479519687 "2017-04-12 05:02:16 GMT" https://flynneware.tumblr.com/post/159479519687/moonlight-spar "Fun quickie with @deeafrotailmisstress . Kerso and Roe get too far ahead of the group while scouting and stop at their new camp to wait for the others to catch up. These two… shouldn’t be left alone together. Roe, you racist. Kerso sat onto the stone in a calm, poised position with a straight back and set shoulders. One could tell by a glance at this orc that he was one that retained a calm and patient demeanor, his older eyes gazed into the setting sun as he held a small cup filled with herbal tea, still steaming. He let out a breath and simply admired the view with a small smile as the wind played with his long hair and the scent of the ocean freshened his lungs.Roendar kicked at the grass at his feet, wiping the blood off his sword from the killing he’d done on the way to this beach. He scraped the blade against the stone as he fidgeted. He was a stark contrast to the stoic orc sitting above him, shoulders sort of slumped and his weight shifted onto one leg as he sighed and rolled his eyes. Of course Kerso’s peace of enjoying the view had to be interrupted by his new favorite elf. Oh joy.“Well, this should do for a temporary campsite.” Roe grumbled, looking around at the area that was surprisingly sparsely populated. Aeo had sent him and Kerso to scout ahead. Lyn too, actually, but he sort of… lost track of her. She’d be around soon. “Still don’t know why you had to come with.” He scoffed, glaring up at the orc. Kerso felt himself sigh aggravatedly, but simply turned his head around and eyed disapprovingly at the obvious mess that Roe had made in his wake. He really did wish the drake would be more subtle in his slaughter. The orc simply snorted and smiled dryly.“You and I both know I came along to make sure you did not get carried away Roendar, or that is what Aeolys seems to think.”“Where the fel did you get tea at this hour?” He snarked at him, gesturing to the setting sun. Kerso chuckled amusedly and commented through the rim of his cup before taking a sip.“You would be surprised of how resourceful you can be when one has the experience.” Although really he just carries a spare flask with him at all times. The orc glanced down at the brash elf and raised a brow. “I see you have made quick work of our quarry.”The shorter elf swung his sword with slight bravado, grinning. Short next to the orc, at least. Roe had been the tallest of the group until Kerso waltzed in and towered above him. Jerk.“Sure did,” He chuckled, raising his arms to stretch up skyward, showing off some claws as he did. “I gotta say though, it’s pretty boring having such easy targets lately.” He brought his hand down and buffed the nails on his shirt before flexing his hand in front of him. “Nothing has any fight in it anymore.” He huffed. Kerso snorted at the elf’s boastfulness and raised his eyes up to the darkening sky as he hummed with a small smirk.""Well perhaps you should find bigger prey and make the fight more interesting.” Kerso glanced over and pointed at his claws while gazing over them analytically. “Perhaps by also not brandishing your claws out like a savage in heat.” He drawled before placing the cup down and standing up, having finally sensed that there was no imminent threat that needed his looking out for now. Roe rolled his shoulders and tilted his head to the side, looking at Kerso with an unamused straight-faced deadpan as he sheathed his swords. “They look damn good, thank you.” He drawled, making a rude gesture at the orc with the clawed fingers he criticized. Scales grew down his arms and creeped up his throat and onto his cheeks, making appear even more red in colour than usual as the moonlight hit the scales just right to give them a subtle sheen. “You got any suggestions, old man?” He smirked up at Kerso, grin widening as horns sprouted through the his mop of ruby-coloured hair. “This is hardly ‘savage’.” He snickered. The taller gentleman rolled his eyes at Roe’s crassness and simply brushed himself off as he gazed in an unimpressed manner at the red drake’s flashy show of scales and fangs and horns. This was hardly the first time he had encounters a young one in their prime, high off their power. And it wouldn’t be the last. Kerso simply jumped off the boulder in a heavy, but balanced, thud a mere inch away from Roe’s body. The orc stood up to his full height before gazing up and down at Roe’s form with a raised brow. He smirked.“Well I do, but that would involve you lying on your back defenseless faster than you can say your own name.” He condescendingly patted the cute horns on the drake’s head before he side-stepped him and walked away, picking up his pack. Aeo and Lyn would surely be expecting them soon.Roe’s brows lowered and he glared up at the orc who landed so close to him. Puffing out his chest slightly out of habit as Kerso stood looming over him; he was never one to back down from anything and this was no different. He growled and sneered at Kerso with a fanged snarl as the orc spoke; what made him think to have the indignant nerve to speak to him like that? The condescending tone made the hair on the back of his neck stand on end and he stood up straight, opening his mouth to say something but as soon as the orc’s massive hand came down and patted him on the horns, he froze for a split second, growing not quite hysterical but certainly worse for wear. Now he was pissed, and looked about as flustered and worked up as a rooster with its feathers ruffled.“Why, you…” The growling words rumbled from his throat as he ripped one of the swords from its sheath on his hip and swung forward in a flash that was too quick to be seen by any “normal” person. His skills were usually appreciated by the rest of the group; he was typically a heavy hitter but would be fast when it was necessary. The sword stopped not even an inch from Kerso’s face, or more aptly the back of his head, with the edge of the blade just barely grazing the orc’s ear. “Do NOT.” The hot headed elf growled, “Threaten me.”Kerso froze, not really expecting the boy to be brash- or rather idiotic- enough to go for a hit directly to the head. The orc’s demeanor didn’t change, except for the sudden no-nonsense aura that suddenly emanated from his being, especially after the smile from his face was now nowhere in sight. Replaced instead by a dangerously blank expression as Kerso’s calm eyes gazed indifferently at the blade to his face, like one would look at a gnat that strayed to close for one’s liking. Finally his eyes reached Roe’s with a dangerously piercing stare.“Choose your next actions very carefully Roendar,” He growled in a voice that emanated authority and demanded respect. “For the last fool that held a blade to my head ended up wishing that they were never born. So I now ask you. Are you threatening me, boy?” He growled the last word deeply as he narrowed his eyes with a gaze that practically dared Roe to inch his blade any further.Roendar didn’t dare break eye contact with the orc towering over him. The fighter in him was screaming to come out and this was the perfect opportunity. He glared down his blade up at Kerso, not moving a muscle as he stayed the sword with one hand stretched out, pointing it at him.“Well lucky for you I was hatched.” He hissed at him, the sarcasm just dripping off of his words. The look on Kero’s face showed Roe instantly that he meant business, and he smirked. Almost a grin as he lifted his chin indignantly at the taller, older male, flaring a puff of steam out of his nostrils as the word ‘boy’ hit his ears and pushed his boastfulness over the edge. “I’ve always had a rebellious streak, Pops. Don’t act so surprised.” He growled out smoothly. Kerso hummed nonchalantly with a sneer, sniffing as he gazed down at the sword.“Well for future reference Roendar.” Before he suddenly smashed his palm up against the blade so it went flying so fast that in a blink of an eye Kerso had already grabbed Roe’s other arm and rammed him against the boulder with both arms now held twisted behind his back. The orc at this point used his raw strength and weight that to any mortal would be apparent that it was beyond any power that even a larger orc would have. Kerso held onto Roe’s wrists with an iron grip, making sure that the blade was tilted so that if the elf moved even an inch, it would give him a clean shave to the back of his skull to say the least. The older dragon leaned in so his lips were against Roe’s ears and growled deeply. “Don’t call me Pops. You understand?”The smirk on Roe’s face was quickly vanished as the orc moved with incredible speed and strength against him and swiftly overpowered the elf. In the split second his sword was knocked out of his grip, his pupils shrunk with the adrenaline rush that suddenly overcame his body, his muscles tensing as he glared at the orc. Before he could so much as open his maw to growl defensively at Kerso, he found himself painfully twisted and his face was slammed into the boulder behind them both, followed by the weight of Kerso laying into him and keeping him there, as well as the vice-like crushing grip about his wrists that were now wrenched behind his own back. He yelled out in a growl, fangs out as he roared at the orc.“GET OFF!” He shouted, struggling to yank his arms free, but he froze as he felt the blade against the back of his head and grazing his neck. The entire quick attack from Kerso happened so fast that Roe didn’t even have a chance to register until just now, the eyepatch that covered his right eye had been cut during the scuffle and had fallen to the ground, leaving the nasty scar that dragged across it to be seen by anyone, as well as the reason behind wearing it in the first place. His gaze slid over out of the corner of his eye and glared at Kerso, but he didn’t dare move. The exposed golden eye matched the orc’s own deathly stare, its pupil narrowed into a slit. It was the only feature he actually made an effort to hide from people; unable to be hidden under his mortal disguise like the rest of him. His chest rose and fell heavily with his breaths as tension rose, along with the lump in his throat as the orc suddenly moved in close and growled in his ear. The voice sent a chill down his spine but also made a heat rise in his core. ""Get your filthy hands off of me, you damn dirty orc.” He snarled, a soft but threatening rumble in his throat as a flush lightly tinted his cheeks.Kerso waited for him to stop struggling, only raising the blade to graze Roe’s hard skin when needed. It wasn’t until he continued to stare back that Kerso’s demeanor froze by just a second, taken aback slightly by the savage piercing yellow gaze that this red drake struck him with. Remarkable if the orc would admit anything flattering about him; that such raw power was barely contained in such a small form and yet cracks of animosity could be seen in his aggression and roughness. Kerso simply gazed back with his ever thoughtful gaze, analyzing Roe’s face with a slight frown at his insubordinate tone. No matter though, the old dragon had a feeling that he would have plenty of time to break that lesson into him, as now was simply not the place or time for such a lesson. Kerso finally smirked slightly and shrugged.“Good enough.” Before he pushed back Roe against the rock and whirled the blade expertly in his hands before throwing it to the ground harshly. “And don’t bother with a second attempt or I will knock you on your back next time.” He added, backing off of the elf. Roe was fuming at this point, growling through gritted teeth, and his defensive stance and tense muscles didn’t let up even as Kerso let off of him, not before giving him another shove into the rock first, though. He heaved a yelp as his face got smashed into the rock’s less-smooth surface and staggered back two steps as he was let go. He turned around and massaged his wrists, still glaring at Kerso. He really hoped no one was spying on them or just happened to walk by; seeing a towering orc having a face-off with an elf with two different eye colours had to be alarming, to say the least. He growled as Kerso toyed with his sword and trudged over to where it landed in the dirt, grasping the hilt and yanking it out of the ground. He tilted his head to the side and then the other with an audible crack and rubbed the back of his neck.It was obvious from his heavy, growling breaths and him still having retained his scaly features that he hardly through this orc. He didn’t fit in with the rest of the group anyway; why was Aeo letting him travel with them again? No matter, he figured he would just take care of it himself, as he kept his gaze locked onto Kerso’s and whipped out his other sword, swinging wide for a heavy hit at the orc’s chest and legs. He was furious now and hardly careful with his attack. Kerso rolled his eyes and sighed exasperatedly.“They never listen..” He dodged quickly again and rolled his shoulders and placed his feet in a stable position, his hands at the ready in a tiger stance. “C'mon then boy, I don’t have all night.” Kerso taunted him, hoping to get this over with and perhaps rush some of the anger out of Roe to tire him out. This only caused the redhead to grow even angrier, now that he was being taunted. He would have been seeing red, but yellow and green didn’t exactly mix that way. He bared his fangs at Kerso and snarled as he charged in at the smug orc, crossing his arms over his chest before swinging a quick horizontal strike against the orc.“DON’T CALL ME THAT!” He roared, blindly swinging as his scales continued to encroach on his body with his rising and now out-of-control anger. Shaking his head in disappointment, so much potential wasted in an attack blinded by rage, the orc simply ducked downward before swirling his leg out and kicking Roe’s feet out from under him before he reached up again and shaped his hand into a tiger-palm before slamming it right onto the elf’s chest with such harsh force that it would surely send him slamming down to the ground on his back. Just like he had promised him. He kicked away the blade again so the brash red drake didn’t get any funny ideas while down there, and pressed a hand down so that the orc found himself on top of Roe again, this time with his feet on either side of the younger elf’s legs, and his hand holding up Roe’s wrists above his head. Kerso’s other hand however, remained threateningly raised above Roe’s forehead, his middle and forefinger pointing towards his forehead.“Like I said.” The orc frowned in a disappointed manner. Roe growled out as he was slammed onto his back, glaring up at the orc. “You would do well to not use those claws like a savage beast. You leave yourself open to someone with a clearer mind and you waste more power through your rage. Do not mistake me Roendar, I am not your enemy.” Kerso then leaned in frighteningly close so his face was merely an inch away from Roe’s.“But should you choose to not offer any respect to me as your new associate, then I shall offer the same kindness in return. So don’t test me, because I will not hesitate to knock you out right now like a child being put to sleep. Nod if you are clear.” Roe groaned in pain, wanting to move and get up, but Kerso wasn’t allowing it and was now much too close into Roe’s personal space bubble for his own comfort. As much as he put on a glaring face at the orc, nothing could hide the red flush in his cheeks. He yanked at his wrists but Kerso was fathoms stronger than him. What a pain. The others would be here any minute.His glare became slightly confused, and his ears drooped slightly at the sound of the orc’s commanding voice. He growled through his teeth at him but finally looked away and stopped struggling, his face admitting defeat enough in his expression. “Good.” The orc huffed, slowly getting up so as to make sure the elf wasn’t going to pull anything else; he honestly didn’t put it past him to do so. The orc pulled himself up and brushed himself off, looking around and sighing “Alright then, let’s get moving. I’m not too keen to be standing around here with no dinner.” He took out his staff and used it as a walking stick as he wandered off. Roe got up, not without stumbling a bit, and cracked his neck as he rubbed the back of his head.“Whatever, old man.” He grumbled, trying to rub the flush off of his cheeks." True text

Peer pressured by @datwolfmonraz to post these :P Here we…”I am tempted to make a dragon but I’d have no idea where to start with them D:I can honestly tell you that Roe was developed purely by spur of the moment. I had a demon hunter lying around already who wasn’t an RP character yet (shame on me), and I tweaked his appearance a little bit, gave him a mog, and started out with this new race I’d never dabbled with before - a red drake. I typically don’t have a plan for a character when I first make them. I just kinda go “hey this sounds like fun” and then go from there. Probably 80% of all my characters’ development is through roleplay with friends and writing stories. I can guarantee that all of my characters are nothing like how they started out now. Due to a subplot with Zari having a dragon as an ex-lover who robbed and tried to kill her, @datwolfmonraz and I (feel free to add more information when you see this) decided we need some “good guy” dragons on a neverending quest to purge the not-so-good dragons. In a nutshell lol. It started with Aeo being the one who wants to rid Azeroth of rebel dragons and give his kind a better name and remove the bad reputation they have. Roe just happened to be a companion who met him along his journey and tried to kill him in Coldarra when Malygos had gone mad. Somehow they managed to stay alive long enough to learn each other’s motives and have been traveling together ever since. Dragons slaying dragons, fun stuff. My knowledge of dragon lore is sparse but between picking Raz’s brain and studying as much as I can from different sources, I’m learning as I go. Other than that, I simply have fun in the meantime! " True text

Hooray!)) Written together with @datwolfmonraz , who owns Aeolys and Mehalyn. Roendar  is mine.Mehalyn sighed as she paced the space, kicking stones when they touched her feet.“Hate waiting.” She complained as her bird sat on her arm. The woman kept it close petting it as the bird nibbled at her hair. Roendar meanwhile growled as he stood on the broken pillar behind his companion, walking around on it restlessly and dragging his blades against the stone behind him. He’d occasionally take a swipe at a passing bird or insect out of annoyance.“Why does he ALWAYS do this to us?!” He grumbled. Mehalyn scowled.“I’m sure it’s your over zealous desire to kidnap what is supposed to be our only lead. Pretty sure this has to do with you.” She snarked back at him.” She came too close to the edge and Sunfeather softly squawked at her and she stopped on a dime. The hot-headed male jumped down to the ground as his boots announced his landing rather loudly.“I am NOT,” He huffed. He sheathed his twin swords as he stepped toward where she was, and glanced down at her. “…Probably just doesn’t want you wandering alone again.” He chided, the smirk in his voice as well as on his face. Mehalyn bared her teeth at his comment. Both hands moved quickly, tossing her sleepy bird into the air, as she grabbed her sword. Swinging it at Roe and stopping in front of his face. Her bird screeched in annoyance and flew a short distance away.“I DON’T need a babysitter! I’m fine on my own, damnit!” She seethed. If she could glare she would. Roe’s feet shifted on the ground but he didn’t move, just lifted his chin as his head leaned back an inch away from the blade pointed at him.“Whoa now, easy babe. I was just kidding.” He tapped her weapon with a clawed hand and pushed it to the side a bit. “I know you can take care of yourself.” His other hand scratched the back of his head and he sighed. Mehalyn was just a little on edge due to Aeo’s persistence that she not ‘wander off’. He’d not been keen when she ended up lost and at a Horde inn. Lyn was sure Roe got the same stern talking to she did. She growled and snapped her weapon away as he gently pushed it away, sheathing the swords with a huff.“Aeo doesn’t seem to think so…” She said walking a little away from her companion.“He doesn’t seem to think a lot of things.” Roe grumbled in return as he watched her go by. “Trust me. But he wouldn’t bring along someone he couldn’t count on just to have to watch constantly.” He followed and clapped a hand on her shoulder and pushed past her. “Think about that the next time you get your ears twisted over a passive remark.” His claws tapped at the sword hilt on his hip, eager to find something to do. Mehalyn’s head darted to Roe as he clasped a heavy hand on her shoulder. As much as she wanted to punch him in the ribs for touching her, he had a point. She crossed her arms over her chest with a huff, blowing hair away from her face as she listened to the footsteps move away from her. Opting to remain quiet for the moment.“Where’s the pillar, Sunny?” She asked the bird. Sunfeather chirped and continued to do so, leading her to a pillar. Lyn followed and stopped when the chirping became more aggressive. She touched the pillar and turned to sit against the small ledge. “I’m going to go mad with boredom.” She grumbled leaning her head against the pillar.Roe watched her with intrigue; she and that bird often took care of themselves better than he expected a lot of the time. He continued surveying their perimeter while Lyn took a seat, and he began to pace. “You got that right.” He drew into the stone under his feet with his blade, scraping a crude pattern on the floor. “I wonder how long he’s gonna drag this out when he finds that girl.” Growling, he grew frustrated and thrust the sword deep into one of the large cracks. “Better at least include us; I’m getting sick of standing around.” Mehalyn frowned at the sound,“You’re going to chip your sword.” She chided, recrossing her arms. “You know Aeo. Takes everything cautiously slow…” She said casually. Then a scent touched her nose, faint but it was there. “I can smell demons on the wind… Some distance away.” She said more to herself then to Roe. She lifted her head from the pillar as a thought hit her. Roe might have been her least favorite person but he shared her love of bloodshed. “Could… Maybe take care of them?” She suggested, knowing this would mean leaving where they were supposed to stay. Roe had been semi-distracted out of sheer boredom, and caught himself staring at Lyn for a rather long moment. He was getting ready to suggest something else the two of them could do together to pass the time, but her words brought him back into focus and he blinked, shaking his head.“Some nose you got there.” He had to give her credit where it was due; she often noticed things way before he did with the heightened senses she possessed. He gazed into the distance and rolled his shoulders. “Demons, huh? Now that sounds like some fun I could get behind.” He gripped the handle of his sword and yanked it out of the ground, sheathing it. “We can just tell Aeo we made our own fun.” He said with a laugh. Mehalyn gave a dark grin, showing her fangs as he agreed to hunt down the demons she could smell. She unfolded her arms and bounced off the pillar. Lyn didn’t say it but she was happy he agreed with her. She sniffed the air as she walked, getting her bearings before turning her head to where she’d last heard Roe.“Stop stabbing the stone floor and follow me.” She said as she started to walk towards the smell she caught faintly. Roe played with the blade’s hilt, clicking it in and out of its scabbard. He loved seeing that grin of hers; it meant she wasn’t down in the dumps anymore and was ready to go do something. As much as they butted heads, he had to admit she was good company in the right mindset. This was one of them. He followed slowly at first.“Don’t have to tell me twice; I’ll gladly follow that any day.” He growled through his own grinning fangs as his gaze took in a good eyeful of her backside. He didn’t gawk long, though; after the smart remark he picked up his pace to walk closer to her side than behind her. Mehalyn walked slower and turned her face towards her companion.“Follow what?!” She sounded more confused than offended. Simply put, she didn’t understand what he meant. That sounded like a comment Aeo would scold him for but their over protective leader never explained what Roe meant by such comments. Or why he punched or scolded him at all. She frowned at him and kept walking. Once they were far enough away from the road Lyn shifted into her true form, as it would be quicker to run with four legs then two. Flying wasn’t exactly on her mind at the moment.Roe merely replied, “Nothing.” He got a mischievous glint in his eye as they turned around the bend and he quickly followed suit, seeing Lyn drop her guise into something a bit more comfortable. No one had to tell him twice; he hated being forced to retain his mortal form constantly, probably more than anything. It was often that he fought with Aeo to be “scaly”, as he preferred to call it, but Aeo wouldn’t even let him show so much as a claw-tipped finger. Needless to say, he wasn’t going to let this opportunity get away.“Finally!” He yelled excitedly. Taking a running leap and landing next to Lyn in a flurry of claws, the red drake stretched his wings out wide before folding them back in, growling contentedly as his claws dug into the earth beneath them. “Got the same ideas tonight, I see.” Mehalyn jolted as Roe landed beside her, sliding away from the over zealous dragon. She growled softly as she curled her lip.“Don’t ruin the moment.” She sneered. Her eyes were closed, sewn shut from her tragic time with the orcs of Outland. But they bothered her less in her true form. “And we keep this between us… Aeo doesn’t need to know.” She said as she sniffed the air once more. The female didn’t need to say anything to her bird companion, Sunny already knew to steer her away from trees or other obstacles she might run into. Roendar scoffed.“He’ll never find out.” His growling voice rumbled. He lifted his head and looked around, keeping an eye out for anyone they didn’t need seeing them. No one would be happy with him if he killed or ate any mortals; he had a good streak of “accident-free” days going at this point. Before he could say anything else, however, he looked ahead to see Lyn already walking away from him, led by her handy seeing eye bird. As amusing a sight as it was, small bird leading large nether drake, Roe trotted behind her, slowing down to her pace as he caught up. “So, this just for fun, these demons? Or are you hungry and looking for an upset stomach?” He joked as he walked beside her. Mehalyn followed both her bird and her nose, although the smell of something dead made her hiss with disgust. Roe would see the faceless one the caravan killed not too long ago, it’s body soaking the soil in poison ooze.“I don’t want to eat the demons! Why would I eat demons?!” She scoffed as her clawed paw touched the ooze. “I just want to kill something…” Instantly she sneered and shook it free, pondering if she should try flying over or just walk through. “Ugh what is that smell… It’s worse than you.”“EXCUSE ME,” He snarled in response. “Last I checked, people liked the scent I carry. Burning fire, searing coals in a forge… That snout of yours must be malfunctioning.” He did glance down though and made a disgusted face at the remains of the monstrosity that laid on the ground. “Quite a beast… what kind of people does this chick have working for her to take out something that huge?” He stepped in a bit of the gunk and quickly washed it off as they crossed through some flooded waters.“It’s working just fine!” Lyn retorted as she paced the puddle trying to find dry land. “And who likes your smell? Honestly, who?” She paused when he mentioned a ‘beast’ and she realized that was what she smelled, whatever it was. “Whu-what is it?” She said huffing and giving up walking through the goop. She felt like she’d probably regret it later.“I donno, people who like… the smell of a hard working man?” He dropped the topic. “Over here.” He said, stepping onto a patch of dry land. “Something out of the depths, by the looks of it.” He said darkly, hissing. “N’raqi. At least it’s dead now.” Glancing around, he saw a few more dead things as his eyes panned around the area. “Seems like we ran into their path, at least. You’re sure this is the right way?”“More like gross red dragon…” Lyn mumbled under her breath. She kept walking, happy to be on dry land for the moment. “I don’t want to get closer to it. Messes with the smell of demons.” She huffed. “And yes it’s the right way.” They traveled on until even Roe could catch the scent of demons on the wind. Their putrid fel fire was hard to miss. “Told you I smelled demons.” Lyn sassed the male. Roe stalked along the ground carefully, immediately on edge now that they were arriving at their targets’ destination.“Yeah, yeah, I didn’t doubt you. Sheesh.” He shook his head, huffing out his nostrils at the heavy smell; the air was thick with it. “Mother of fel, that’s a stench I’ll never get used to.” He growled. Taking a few steps forward, he looked back at Lyn before he got too overeager. After all, this was her idea in the first place. “Well, madam, we’ve arrived. Ladies first, but save me some leftovers.” He snickered at his own joke. Mehalyn growled lowly.“It’s a stench I never forget.” She said darkly as she crouched low like a stalking cat thought this gave way to her elven form. She had more agility in this form and her small size allowed for her to be less of a target. She pulled her swords and grinned. “I’ll save you an imp.” She snarked as she phased into the nether, disappearing from sight but suddenly she was behind one of the Satyr guarding the gates. In a flurry of blades and blood she started hacking into her prey. Her bird meanwhile flew high above and well out of the fight. The second satyr roar and started to charge her.Roe watched her for a moment. She had a style that was unmatched and unique in itself. “Guess I’ll have to race you for something a little bit better than that!” He retorted at her with a laugh. The male wasted no time, huge red wings beating into the air as he leapt skyward and roared. As one of the demons looked up to see where the drake went, it would instead see the muscular elf careening down from the sky as Roe landed on top of the satyr and slammed his claws into the enemy’s throat to tear it out. Two horns were sat upon his head and curved around his ears, and he opened his fanged maw and roared out a challenge to their foes. He drew one of his swords from its sheath and sliced it clean into the satyr, blood spattering on the elf’s skin from the carnage. Roe breathed heavily but with zeal as his head turned to scope out his next target. He reached a hand up and ripped off pieces of his armour and chucked them behind him, revealing arms covered in scales that crept up onto his throat and along his jaw. “Oh yeah, this feels right!” He growled out, a sword in each hand as he dashed forward to try and pick off the one who was charging at Lyn.Mehalyn jumped back as her foe swung back at her but she quickly leapt on it. Stabbing one sword deep into it’s chest while the other sliced off it’s head. Covered in blood both elf and demon fell to the ground. Lyn rolled off the body and looked up, her keen ears hearing more in the distance.“I heard more.” Lyn cooed as she turned to them. She started to run and then again disappeared into the nether, popping out again behind a felguard this time. She stabbed her blade into the demons back but the hulking demon was a little harder to kill then the last. It flailed and she dodged it’s clawed hands as much as she could. A chittering warble sounded around her and the pulled a dagger from her belt and threw it, instantly killing an imp. The felguard grabbed her and slammed her on the ground. She let out a painful cry as the demon swung a massive axe at her face. Reacting quickly she slammed her blades out and stopped the deadly blow. The runes on her skin pulsed with arcane nether energy and suddenly the power shot from her hands. Raw nether melted the skin from the demon and fel blood poured from the wounds. She rolled over and stabbed it in the gut and yanked her sword hard, spilling the guts of her enemy onto her feet. “This is so much better than being bored!” She yelled gleefully.Roe shot his hand out and grabbed a larger demon by the face, pushing and slamming it down hard onto the ground while he swung down with his other arm and cleaved into it. His eyes snapped over to Lyn’s position from time to time while they fought and burned off excess energy. He caught her just in time to see her melt some faces and his mouth opened partially to gawk in silence at her ferocity. He shoved his other blade into two satyrs that tried to blindside him, effectively skewering the now howling creatures.“What, she gets all the attention?” He shouted out to no one in particular, lifting his boot and kicking the demons off of his blade. “Where’s my love at?” He mock-pouted and started to chuckle before he was slammed down to the ground from an imp’s firebolt from behind knocking him off his feet, followed promptly by three of more large demons piling on top of him. Before a moment of silence could be offered for his being crushed, Roe bellowed out a roar and a pair of red wings burst through the pile of bodies, flinging them off of him so he could slice and dice the ambushers to pieces. He slammed his foot into the last dead satyr’s head for emphasis, dragging his blade across its body while more blood sprayed onto his arms. “That’s more like it!” He shouted out before chasing after another, bigger demon that wanted to try its luck.The felguard roared and Lyn swung her sword up at it and cut off it’s lower jaw then another swing sliced its throat open, covering the woman more wit putrid felblood. Snarling gurgling growls sounded beside her and she slammed her sword into the head of a felhunter. It howled like a dog in pain as she stabbed it again. Teeth slammed down on her leg as a second came to help. She yelled out and stabbed this one, nearly severing its head. She yanked her blades free as a warbling chitter sounded ahead of her and she was knocked back with a fire bolt. Lyn roar furiously and teleported to the annoying imp and kicked it hard. The flailing creature flew into Roe, hitting him in the back. She whirled around to kill another couple of satyrs, severing the legs of one and the head of the other.Roe let out a beastial roar and reeled his arm back, driving his sword into the felguard’s heart. Or at least, that was the plan, until a flying imp screamed through the air and landed in the middle of his back, between his shoulderblades, causing him to trip over and aim his killing blow down into the demon’s stomach instead. He howled from the impact and was brought down to one knee as the felguard doubled over on his sword and knocked Roe down. He gripped the blade tight and drove it further into the creature, ripping through its side and freeing the blade so he could stab it a few more times properly. His other hand swung around and sliced its head clean off; he spun around and pitched it Lyn’s way as he shouted at her.“Watch where you’re aiming, little WHELP!” He hissed at her, his rage seething through gritted fangs. He could hear the imp behind him chattering annoying spells and jabs, and he growled furiously, tossing his sword into the air while he flexed a clawed hand. He caught the sword by the hilt as it dropped back into his hand and he twirled back around with the intention to land a backhanded swing down on the imp behind him. Mehalyn snarled as she finished off her last satyr.“How DARE you call me that! You shouldn’t be in the way!” She started viciously stabbing the demon in front of her a few more times. But then she paused as a familiar scent drifted on the wind. One that made her stand up straight, like a little girl about to get in trouble with her parent. Just before Roe landed the killing blow on the imp it was teleported away. A spell Lyn didn’t have. The imp gave a extremely short yelp when he reappeared in midair before being turned to ice. It fell to the ground and shattered all over Aeolys’ plate boots.“Roenstraz! Mehalynaku!” His usually calm voice boomed.“This isn’t what it looks like…” Lyn stated as Aeo’s heavy boots walked up to the pair.“So you aren’t killing demons?” He said and Lyn mumbled as blood dripped from her face. His ice blue eyes looked to Roe. “What the hell were you thinking?!”Roe at first growled as his blade struck dirt, but his initial rage was swiftly quelled by the chill air he could feel behind him.“Oh, shit.” He deadpanned. His face was already wincing in anticipation of an entirely different kind of fight. Glancing over and seeing Lyn’s attitude changing completely, he stood and grabbed his sword, turning around while pulling it out from the ground behind him. He lifted a hand up and scratched the back of his head with his claws sheepishly. “Ugh, Aeo, look, we-” He tried to get an opening excuse out before his ears drooped at the sound of his full name, and he winced harder. He tried to wipe some of the demon blood off of his brow, though at this point it was everywhere on his body and armour, and in his hair as well. He sighed and ran his blade across his hand to wipe the blood off of the weapon before he sheathed it and opened his mouth to speak again.“Lighten up, it was just some harmless fun. Besides, it was her idea in the first place. She smelled them.” He droned, not even taking a second thought before blaming Lyn. “It’s not like anyone saw us.” He shrugged. “Just a couple of elves fighting demons. Nothing out of the ordinary.” Mehalyn gasped and flailed her weapon in Roe’s direction but her sword clashed with Aeo’s, which left the sheath in a split second.“Enough!” He roared like a dragon. The smaller female jumped and moved back a step and tried to retort but Aeo was having none of it. “I know damn well this was your idea. He can’t smell the demons!” He snarled, causing the young woman to huff like a teenager in trouble. With his free hand Aeo roughly grabbed one of Roe’s exposed horns and yanked his face to his level. “Just a couple of elves?! I suppose you are half draenei then?” He barked at the taller male, shaking his head while gripping the horn. Roendar let out a growling yelp as Aeo’s hand shot up and seized him by the horn, dragging him down a couple inches into a stoop. He almost tripped from the surprise, slamming his boot into the ground to brace himself.“GAH! Easy on the goods!” He whined, wincing as he was shook. “Plenty of people wear horned helms, come on…” He tossed his hand and Roe’s face away. He staggered back as Aeo released his grip and forced him back; he stood up straight, rubbing his sore neck. “Warn me next time before you play rough, Frosty.” He grumbled, though a sly grin tugged at his lips.“How did you get here?” There was silence as Lyn tried to defend herself.“I blend in, unlike his giant red ass.” She snarked.“You are a bright translucent green with stripes that pulse with nether energy. YOU ARE HARDLY INCONSPICUOUS.” He bellowed. Lyn bowed her head and curled her arms and weapons around her. Roe bared his fangs at her.“Listen, you little green pain in the ass…” He took a step toward her and raised a finger at her accusingly. Aeo snapped his cold eyes at Roe with his snarky comments, if his glare could do damage Roe’s horns might have been ripped from his head. A chill filled the space and Lyn knew Aeo was thoroughly pissed off. But Roe wasn’t holding his snarky tongue. Aeo stepped between the two and pushed Roe back. “Knock it-” But Lyn was yelling over him.“What?! What are you gonna do? Belch fire on me? I’d stab you in the ass before you knew what was going on!” She snarled trying to get in his face. But Aeo grabbed her and moved her back.“I said knock it off! And you!” He pointed at Roe. “Quit antagonizing her before I ‘chill’ you out.” He warned. Roe usually tried to avoid Aeo’s gaze, but his eyes did shift over to glare at him as he stood between him and Lyn. The redhead had had enough of this little blind female constantly challenging him. Aeo had pushed him back but as Lyn kept taunting him, he bared his fangs and snarled, smacking Aeo’s arm away that pushed him back as he slammed his boot down onto the ground to advance toward the female.“You don’t want to deal with these flames, WHELP!” A pair of wings burst from his back and beat into the air once as he shouted at her, his voice shifting to something more guttural. “I’ll stop antagonizing her when she learns her place.” The words rumbled from his throat and he roared, the soft ground sinking some under his weight, hands stretched out and flexing at his sides. He was prepared to leap forward and sink those claws into her skin at this point as he huffed out, forcing a flare of steam out of nostrils. Mehalyn wasn’t backing down. She might not have seen him show off but she could hear his snarls. She snarled back, a lighter fluttering bellow as she readied to leap on him. That is until Aeo’s wing came out and knocked her back, his elf form with scales, horns and wings, just like Roe’s. He roared at her and belched out ice that froze the sassy little female in place. He then wheeled around to Roe, knocking a fist back and clocking the hot headed one in the face. Truth was Roe could have easily ripped the little nether drake apart in his true form. So Aeo made it a point to get her out of harm’s way before that happened.“That is my job. Not yours!” Aeo snarled at the taller male. Roe may have had a couple inches of height on the other male, but Aeo was quick, both in mind as well as actions. As his eyes registered Lyn getting subdued by the blue’s icy breath, his head turned just as Aeo was spinning back to face him, fist cocked and ready. The punch closed in so fast that poor Roe didn’t have a moment to react other than to take it dead center, the morbid crunching sound resounding in the forest and sending him quickly to the ground.He groaned in pain from the blow as he propped himself up on his hands and knees. Blood trickled down from his cheek and nose, dripping onto his hands that grabbed fistfulls of grass as he took a moment for his head to stop spinning. A good sizeable scratch streaked across his face from Aeo’s razor sharp scales. Roe flipped around and propped himself up on his elbow as he sat on the ground and glared up at the horn-clad blue elf. A deep growl rumbled from his throat but his gaze didn’t match Aeo’s for long before he looked away and glared at the ground. It often took getting into fights this bad for him to finally back down and cooperate. Aeo stood stoic, watching Roe’s every move. Waiting for retaliation but it didn’t come. Sky blue runes almost seemed to shimmer on the sapphire scales of his wing. He huffed and folded them around him, making them disappear. Although for the moment his horns and scaled skin stayed.“Glad I could knock some sense into you.” He said in his normal cool monotone voice. His hand reaching out to help Roe up. By the time Aeo helped his hot headed companion up his scales and horns vanished. He glance back at frozen Lyn, opting for now to just leave her like that. Roe clasped his hand into Aeo’s and was swiftly pulled back up onto his feet. He continued to wipe the blood off of his face and brushed some of the dirt and grime off of his armour, glancing over at the frozen female and smirked at her.“So,” Roe muttered, his wings folding in and vanishing, scales receding on the hand that came up and wiped the blood off of his mouth. “You’re back awfully late. Did you find the girl or not?”“Yes. Yes I did. But about that.” He said placing his hands on his hips and looking up at Roe. “Were you gonna tell me Lyn wandered off from the camp and the two of you chatted with members of the caravan?” He said raising a brow. Roe’s ears twitched at Aeo’s sudden question and he blinked, a slight look of shock on his face as he stared at him. How did he know?“Euhhh…” Was all he could stammer out, his hand sheepishly scratching the back of his head as he glanced around. “…Nooo… I mean.” He gestured a hand over in Lyn’s direction. “She went running off when I wasn’t looking! And I’m sick of babysitting her, by the way.” He huffed with a growl. “I had to go and find her. I could have just left her; she wasn’t talking to anybody important. Just some little thing.” Aeo sighed and rubbed his temples as he walked to the frozen block that was Lyn.“A little troll named Jazali. I know.” He said looking up at Roe. The blue haired elf sighed and shook his head. “She is naive to how our society works, Roe. I’m not asking you to babysit… I’m asking you to be a role model.” He huffed as he laid a hand on the ice block. “She called you something fitting though… What was it… Oh yes. Cyclops elf.” He said and a pulse of blue magic melted the ice and Lyn fell to the ground shivering. Her blue lips trembled as she stuttered words.“T-thought you w-were gonna l-leave me in-in there…” Aeo looked down. “I thought about it. Not another word from you.” He warned the little female. Roe glared at Lyn, watching her thaw out, but said nothing. He considered what Aeo had to say regarding the two of them, and bit his lip. It was difficult enough to resist the urge he had to fight, especially when she preferred to so often take jabs at his pride as well as his kind, but it was going to be even more of a challenge to go beyond that animosity and cooperate together. His head snapped to Aeo at the nickname and he looked confused and angry.“Cyclops?!” He reached up to rip off the incriminating eyepatch from his face, but as his fingers grazed over the deep scars that dragged across the covered eye, he paused and chose not to. “Guess it’s better than whatever she’d say about what’s underneath it.” He sighed. Mehalyn sneered at Roe’s voice. The only thing she didn’t mind about being in the block of ice was she couldn’t understand the voices or words said. But Aeo was no fool and made sure to thaw the tiny female AFTER he said the nickname the little troll said to him. But Roe botched that and upon hearing it she started to giggle as she shivered.“Lyn.” Aeo’s cold stern voice said and she quit with her mocking giggle. He turned back to Roe. “Orcs say scars add character.” He grinned and patted the taller man on the shoulder. “Speaking of finding the girl, I need you two to not get into trouble for one day… That is all I ask. I have to help her retrieve her companion from some Naga.”“Don’t get into trouble. Got it. Don’t worry about us; we never get caught anyway.” He said annoyedly.“That’s not the point.” Aeo said walking to his stone horse before turning around. “You make it sound like the two of you frolic in your true forms when I’m gone…” Lyn sighed and shook her head.“No we don’t! Just this one time…” She wasn’t being completely truthful but Aeo didn’t push the issue.“You know if you two worked half as good together as you do when fighting I wouldn’t worry so much.” Roe blew off some steam, which would be speaking figuratively if it weren’t for the literal smoke he huffed out.“Yeah, yeah, tell that to her. Maybe if she’d stop insulting me and actually let me help for once, I’d…” He trailed off and grumbled. “Ah, forget it.” He stomped off to search for scattered pieces of armour that he’d cast aside earlier, picking up his gauntlets and strapping them onto his arms. “Just hurry up and follow through with your plan already; I’m getting bored.” He called out to Aeo. He was sick of getting left behind on the blue elf’s special missions.“I’d say you worked well together here…” Aeo looked at the piles of demon corpses. Lyn had stood up and opened her mouth to retort but she heard Aeo take a step towards her and she hushed. Not wanting to be frozen again.“Maybe…” She finally huffed as she followed the blue haired elf. Aeo paused and looked at them, leaning on the saddle a moment. Roe was a hot head who needed to take out his aggression on whatever he could. Lyn was a rebellious teen who also needed to take out her aggression on whatever she could. He sighed and scratched his brow.“Well… further down the coast I heard something about naga attacking travelers. Over in Darkshore. Why don’t you go with Kerso-” Lyn promptly groaned. “And take care of those naga… What?” Lyn pouted like a teen girl.“He’s weird. And takes the form of an orc.” Aeo faced her,“I’ll have none of that. He’s a valuable ally… And a good cook.” Roe strapped his second pauldron back into place and rolled his shoulders, cracking loudly.“Eh, he’s got a point.” He said, walking back over to the two. “Naga aren’t the toughest things to put up a fight, but it’s still something to do, and get out of this damn forest.” He nudged Lyn’s arm with his own, a growl rumbling in his throat as he spoke with reluctance. “Sorry for nearly killing you… I guess.” He grumbled. He wasn’t so keen on traveling with the one who preferred an orc’s form either. Why did he and the female has to have so much in common, damn it? He rolled his eyes and sighed. “It’s still better than being bored. Come on, let’s find Kerso and get outta here.” He droned as he waved goodbye to Aeo and made his way down the hill. “That old geezer better keep up with us.” Mehalyn curled her lip when Roe nudged her but she stayed her smart mouth, and blades. She started to just walk away when Aeo’s sing song voice touched her ears.“Lyn, he apologized. He didn’t have to, but he did.” Lyn sighed and turned to Roe’s heavy foot steps.“Yea… Sorry… Mostly for kicking the imp at you.” Aeo raised a brow and looked at Roe. “I guess… It’s better than just sitting at camp.” She sighed as she walked to Aeo’s steed. The blue haired elf got on and steered the beast away.“No. You walk. Settle your differences. With words, not blades.” He said walking the stone construct away.“Ugh seriously?! Uuuuuugh.” She pouted and trudged after Roe. “I don’t think the old man can keep up.” She mumbled loud enough for Roe’s ears only." True text

NEVER engage the perpetrator. He (and it is usually he) is looking for confrontation. Instead speak to the person he is abusing. Say hello. Introduce yourself. Shake his or her hand. And just stand with them. Keep talking. About anything. Weather. Bus schedules. Football. This kind of bullying never works against a group of people having a conversation. Usually a single person travelling or a mom with a kid or maximum, two women are targeted. Form a group of people with and around them if you can. Don’t tell them they are not alone. Just don’t let them be alone. I speak from experience. Once, I encountered a young girl wearing a hijab being abused as a terrorist by a drunk man on a train. I just went and sat beside her and started a conversation with her. After a while, the dude lost interest. I had a lovely chat with a young student from Qatar. She wanted to study literature while her dad was only prepared to pay for engineering or commerce as he wanted her to join the family business. It helped her feel safe and it expanded my horizons.  This is known in behavioral psychology as “non-complimentary behavior”; by not fueling the aggression of another person and you can flip the whole script of all their expectations, and without any footholds for their aggression (like direct provocation and confrontation/conflict) to launch into further tirades against, the aggressor can’t continue their angry scene-building. The more people who participate in script-flipping, the more successful it gets, as in this post you see with the advice to form a protective group between the bigot and their target for that very purpose. There’s an NPR podcast called Invisibilia which goes into detail about how it works and what sort of people rely on it everyday professionally and for survival alike, in their Flipping the Script episode.

I type sentences faster than random words put together in the way this test does it. I had to take this a few times just to get used to it, my top speed being 70 WPM no errors, my first and last being 60 WPM and the rest around 65 WPM.)  I understand completely; let’s try this one instead! (I’ll see if my speed also goes up by switching to sentences) https://www.keyhero.com/free-typing-test/  ( Woo! With full sentences I went up by almost 10 WPM. The keyhero typing test also keeps track of every keystroke error, which is a nice touch. I did this one three times and only had one lower than 75 WPM because it used words I’m actually not familiar with. (yay new words!) )  80 wpm with an accuracy around 97.83%. I probably could’ve done a little better were it not quarter past one in the morning.  Both tests yielded an average of 93 wpm with a 97%+ accuracy rate.  In the second test, my personal best was 97 wpm 100% accuracy.  Then I just got too tired playing with it.  Pretty sure I type faster than that when it’s not almost three in the morning and I’m in the zone rather than going CRAP I made a mistake already crap FOCUS YOU ONLY HAVE A MINUTE.  lol.  Though I’m sure most people probably do better when they’re not trying to impress the timer.  I noticed a lot of people commenting on how they were taking the test late at night or into the wee hours of the morning, hindering their performance. Turns out the same thing happened to me. When I tried it initially last night I ended up with a score of 135 WPM with 90.68% accuracy.I took it again this morning with a clear head and a negative pregnancy test (lol), and I ended up with 149 WPM and 95.51% accuracy. Moral of the story: depression, anxiety, and all-around stress affects EVERYTHING in your life. " False link

TW for mentions of sexual assault and rape. This is so, so important. I’ve never made it a big deal when telling people my history with sexual abuse, molestation, and rape. To me, it’s just something that happened, but I’m still the same person I was before. Maybe wiser, maybe stronger. Certainly more wary. But it certainly didn’t break me. I hate the men for what they did, and I avoid them at all costs. But I’m no mouse living in fear. My point is, this puts everything into words that I could never have thought to say when explaining it to people. So please read it and stop pandering rape victims. And rape victims, if you’re similar to me and aren’t actually horrifically traumatized by your experience, do not use it as a wildcard to gain sympathy and pity whenever you want something. Don’t pretend to be trigger-happy if you’re not. I’ve seen it happen way too often. " False link
