The ones that were working there for free to help represent the people being detained? Well one of the first non-profit groups that came down to the airport is in trouble. The ﻿Northwest Immigrant Rights Project (NWIRP) has been issued a “cease and desist” letter by Jeff Sessions’ Department of Justice.  The DOJ is threatening disciplinary action if this non-profit continues to help immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers. Some background information: One has NO right to counsel in immigration proceedings. That means you can be removed from your home, jailed, deported, etc. without ever seeing a lawyer. It’s 100% legal and totally common, so these lawyers work for free to ensure millions get the representation they deserve. The NWIRP represents children and refugees in immigration and asylum proceedings for free and they are one of thousands around the country.  Here’s an explanation to why the DOJ is issuing this cease and desist:  ﻿“The accusation is that because NWIRP provides advice and assistance to people in immigration proceedings without committing to full representation, it is violating the rules. It’s a Kafkaesque system: The government won’t provide immigrant defendants with legal representation, and they are allowed to get help for free only if they find a lawyer who will commit up-front to a case that will stretch on for years. Otherwise, they’re not allowed to have any help at all, are required to submit complex legal documents with no assistance, and lawyers who try to help them will be sanctioned. Precisely because this would be a cruel and absurd result, NWIRP and its peers around the country have had longstanding agreements with immigration officials that permit them to run asylum-assistance programs without committing to permanent representation. Attacking them now is a shockingly cynical move, akin to sanctioning an emergency-room doctor for sewing up a bleeding patient without first promising to be their doctor for life. ﻿ NWIRP doesn’t know why it was singled out. But we do know that NWIRP has been at the forefront of resisting Trump’s travel ban. Its staff and volunteer lawyers were at SeaTac airport immediately after the White House launched the first Muslim ban, and in March it sued to block the second Muslim ban. And NWIRP isn’t alone; its nonprofit counterparts did the same at airports around the country, leveraging law-school clinics and large-firm lawyers working pro bono. The DoJ’s suspiciously timed cease and desist letter sends a chilling message to exactly these groups, and to volunteer attorneys. This attack by the government on a legal services-provider for immigrants could dissuade law firms from letting their lawyers volunteer for these cases, scaring those firms away by convincing them that immigration-related projects are too risky pro-bono projects.”  The NWIRP has successfully been granted a restraining order, so right now they are still able to help immigrants who need legal advice but their work is at risk. They are now filing a lawsuit to defend itself from the move, the move that will set precedent to other non-profits who do similar work.    If you would like to support them you can join them as a volunteer or donate.  You can also follow regular updates on what they’re doing and the case against the DOJ on their Facebook and Twitter.   (source) (source) " False text

The world needs to know.   Update 1: They’re exchanging fire from both sides. Electricity is down. Friends are reporting that ISIS members are spotted in the schools and are giving them a few minutes to evacuate before they take over. Filipino media is silent.   Update 2: Christian teachers are being held hostage.   Update 3: Hospital staff being detained, ISIS flag has been raised in the city hospital. The fighting occurred not in the outskirts of Marawi, but on its streets, around the city hall and public market. I’m sorry, I’m stringing together what information my friends are still giving me. I don’t know how long they can keep this up - a lot of them are saying that their phones are dying.   Update 4: Armed Forces of the Philippines telling people to go underground, airstrikes coming. Mortars are being prepared too.  UPDATE 5: The Philippine President and his family are in Russia. The Palace remains silent. The military is trying to invalidate ground reports to cover up their fuckups.   UPDATE 6: Philippine National Police and Armed Forces of the Philippines are not responding or have deployed extremely delayed support, according to the Marawi City Mayor in a phone interview.   UPDATE 7: CNN Philippines has a livestream covering the entire thing, eyewitness reports are in, Military is still saying “we’re in full control” when that’s obviously not the case.  https://web.facebook.com/CNNPhilippines/videos/1933243386915551/  UPDATE 8: reports in that terrorists are targeting cell towers now.   UPDATE 9: GENERALS POINTING FINGERS AT EACH OTHER INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE.  UPDATE 10: ARMED FORCES STILL LYING ABOUT THE SCALE OF THIS ATTACK. THEY SAY 15 MEN, WHEN ALL CORRESPONDENTS ARE SAYING THERE ARE AT LEAST 200.  UPDATE 11: generals trivializing the situation, saying “they don’t feel like it’ll last the night,” when people are literally saying that the fighting still continues.

For example, there was Lilly, who was brought to Texas at the age 15 by a couple of American executives at a technology company. They promised her an American education and a path out of poverty for her family in Jamaica, in exchange for working as a live-in nanny for their three children. Instead, as soon as they arrived, they cut off her communication with her family and the outside world. For 15 years, her mobility was restricted. She was not allowed to leave the house unaccompanied or talk to any of the neighbors. And she was never paid.And there was Karmo, who came from Nepal to a Virginia suburb, also escaping extreme poverty, to work for an Indian diplomat. Upon arrival, she was forced to work from early morning until late at night, isolated and prohibited from talking to other people. Karmo’s passport was confiscated by her employer and she was told she could be picked up by the police if she complained. For both Lilly and Karmo, the extreme economic hardships of their families left them vulnerable to false promises of a better life; once in America, force, fear, and lack of other jobs and options made it hard for them to leave.Slavery doesn’t just happen in a vacuum, as some perversion from the bigger economic context that people live in. Deep poverty and few options for economic mobility make a person vulnerable to slavery. Language and cultural barriers, and being a woman make a person vulnerable to slavery. Being dependent on an employer for visa access makes a person vulnerable to slavery. Immigration laws that trap a person in the shadows for fear of deportation keep them vulnerable." False link

In Sandinista-run Nicaragua, sex workers are replacing police officers. Last January, French filmmaker Florence Jaugey released a documentary about the Sunflowers of Nicaragua, a woman-led sex worker collective serving as community mediators for the socialist government. Today, the documentary is receiving praise across Latin America, one of the most dangerous regions in the world for sex workers. “We wanted to show the world that we are not the image they have of us,” Sunflowers of Nicaragua member Maria Elena Davila told El Nuevo Diario.  “We are capable women, we defend our rights, and we are also contributing to justice in our country. This documentary tells our story.” In 2009, members of the Sunflowers of Nicaragua began organizing against discrimination and violence within their communities. They did this with the intention of gaining the trust of their communities in order to win mass support for their primary demand: the judicial integration and unionization of sex workers across the country. Their strategy worked.  In 2015, Nicaragua’s Supreme Court of Justice asked members of the collective if they wanted to work as judicial facilitators in Managua, Economy reports. Now, the sex workers are accredited and have licenses signed by the Supreme Court of Justice to mediate small conflicts in their communities, which include problems between relatives and neighbors.  The program is intended to “reduce the weight on the police and the judicial system” while integrating sex workers into Nicaragua’s judicial system, Jaugey told Economy in a recent interview. “It’s a unique case in the world that the justice authorities have given this responsibility to these women,” Jaugey said.  “But also the success of this film is not just due to Nicaragua and the state of the law here, it’s also due to the goodwill of these women.” The Sunflowers of Nicaragua has also been accepted by the socialist government’s Confederation of Self-Employed Workers, granting them legal union status. The collective, which aims to organize Nicaragua’s estimated 14,000 sex workers, has recruited 2,300 thus far. Last February, Nicaragua’s Ministry of Labor ruled in favor of a sex worker who was fired from a nightclub for being pregnant, setting a precedent for the country’s sex worker labor laws.

I’m so sorry that I have to ask like this, but my financial situation has left me with no other choice. Earlier this week, I was accepted into NYU Tisch’s pre-college acting program. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for me, and I’m still in shock that I managed to get into such an elite program. Unfortunately I was born with a rib deformity known as pectus excavatum, and recently had to have a huge surgery to correct and reconstruct my ribs using metal supports. Both my heart and lungs were being misplaced, and the surgery was a necessity when my pectus began to worsen as I went through puberty and my breathing became restricted. I’m still dealing with chronic pain and i have to take an array of pain medication frequently. This recent surgery and recovery process has left my family without any savings, and I’m no longer able to pay my tuition for the program. I’m completely crushed. A summer at NYU is a once in a lifetime opportunity that could completely change my life. Please donate if you can, and share my gofundme page by reblogging, linking other people to my page, or sharing it on any social media. I don’t want to be held back from my dream by my disability."
