Like? It’s baffling that there are neurotypicals who hate autistic people so much that they’d rather we lose our kids than let us say we’re autistic without having a clinical diagnosis.  Wait why can’t one move to Canada? Is this the case for other countries too and which ones if so?  Canada doesn’t allow anyone to immigrate who is disabled, because the Canadian government considers disabled people a waste of money to provide medical care and services for if they weren’t already a permanent resident before the disability developed or was diagnosed.

Saw a very large spider crawling down my wall, and while I’m not absolutely terrified of spiders now, the leggier ones still give me the heebie jeebies. I waited for it to reach the floor and quickly trapped it under a cup and envelope. I moved to the door as fast as I could, and at this point my mom’s up and getting ready and asked what I was doing and I said “VERY LARGE VERY BIG SPIDER” and she said “oh baby why don’t you just kill it?” and the answer is I want to be nice and also I’m a coward. She tells me to release it at the end of the driveway so it won’t just come back inside, so I hightail it down the path and set the cup down and turn it over. It was empty.That doesn’t make sense, it was huge! How could I have missed or dropped- my thoughts were interrupted when I found the spider; inching its spindly legs along my pajama pants. I screamed, probably waking up the whole street, and flailed around for a good 10 seconds until I was sure it was gone. My mom poked her head out the door with an “Are you okay?” to which I replied “THE SPIDER WASN’T IN THE CUP IT WAS ON ME,” still patting my legs and shaking the fabric of my pants. She laughed. I wasn’t sure where the spider was, so I apologized to the general area of grass.And that’s the story of how I tried to be good and kind at 6 in the morning and it backfired on me horribly, I’m going back to bed."

The character has matured greatly since the hyperactive kid of the original shorts, and part of the emotional crux of the story is how he’s been hardened by his adventures without losing his fundamental desire to help others.”   “The miniseries is a bit looser than “Stakes;” the first half features more self-contained stories, such as an encounter with a friendly-but-annoying water dragon, a meditative piece with Finn stuck on an island with a non-English-speaking human, and a riff on MMORPGs by Graham Falk and Ward himself where BMO gets a chance to grow up and run a dance club (it’s mostly an excuse for some of the most surreal designs this series has ever featured, and that’s saying something).”   “But the back half contains some of the series’ densest backstory, as Susan Strong’s shockingly tragic past is revealed, and the circumstances that led Finn to Ooo are finally revealed (it’s spoiling little to say his awful father Martin was involved).”   “Yet it’s Finn’s story in the end, and the miniseries gives the sense that the character, who suffered major heartbreak over the last few seasons of Adventure Time, has truly grown up over the course of the series. It’s also satisfying that the miniseries puts heavy focus on both new and established female characters, whose emotional arcs and goals are complex and meaningful without being completely defined by their relationship to Finn (it also begs for the return of Lennon Parham’s Dr. Gross, whose backstory here implies she could be the greatest threat Finn and company have ever faced).”     “Though there are a few outright fantasy elements, much of Islands has the feel of an old-school post-apocalyptic SF saga - a journey through a devastated-but-wondrous world, with a sense of danger and mystery detached from the Land of Ooo.”   “Since the series began, Adventure Time has subtly evolved into a story about growing up - becoming a world where the Ice King can go from arch-enemy to sort-of friend, Cinnamon Bun can go from goofball to noble knight, where even an undead evil like the Lich can get a do-over of sorts. The emotional impact of Islands comes from understanding where the characters have been, and how their discoveries impact them. In the end, it’s a tale of discovering a lost past, while also coming to terms with that past, and being able to move forward.  With the series due to end in 2018, it’s an appropriate winding-down – with the hint that still more adventures await back in Ooo.” " False link

But then came Vantablack. Earlier this year, Kapoor sparked outrage from artists all over the world with the announcement that he had made a deal to become the only person in the world allowed to use the blackest pigment of black paint ever developed. Known as Vantablack, the unique carbon nanotube-based pigment is produced solely by a British company called NanoSystem, and was originally developed for military technologies. However, Kapoor made an agreement with the company that he is the only person allowed to use it for artistic purposes. Needless to say, that made plenty of other artists furious. “When I first heard that Anish had the exclusive rights to the blackest black I was really disappointed,” artist Stuart Semple tells Kevin Holmes for The Creators Project. “I was desperate to have a play with it in my own work and I knew lots of other artists who wanted to use it too. It just seemed really mean-spirited and against the spirit of generosity that most artists who make and share their work are driven by.” Like Kapoor, Semple’s work often uses vivid shades of color, and for years he had worked with scientists to develop increasingly intense pigments to use in his artwork. So as a response to Kapoor’s exclusive deal with Vantablack, Semple decided to release his own special pigment, known simply as “Pink,” the Irish Examiner reports.  While “Pink” isn’t based on nanotechnology, like Vantablack, Semple says it is the pinkest pink pigment ever created. Now, in an effort to thumb his nose at Kapoor, Semple is making it for sale to everyone in the world—except Kapoor, Tom Power reports for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation’s Q. i am living have you ever been this petty    😂😂😂  i am sobbing  By adding this product to your cart you confirm that you are not Anish Kapoor, you are in no way affiliated to Anish Kapoor, you are not purchasing this item on behalf of Anish Kapoor or an associate of Anish Kapoor.

(cont. NCRM)  I loved Open House at the beginning of the school year.  My parents are funny, I always made a good impression on my teachers, and bringing my funny parents to meet my teachers who were just so impressed by my manners always put a little skip in my step as a bonafide teacher’s pet and Mama’s boy   So, I had no reason to believe my English teacher during one particular Open House would basically ruin my life for the foreseeable future.  After telling my mom what a great kid I was and how much she loved my writing, she took a hushed tone and asked my mom if she could speak with her privately.  I didn’t actually get to hear the conversation where she told my mother that there were rumors I might be a homosexual, but I did get to hear the conversation on the way home where my mom asked me if I wanted to die of AIDS and burn in Hell.   I heard variations of that conversation until I went to boarding school and the last variation I heard was on my mom’s birthday when she said all she wanted in the form of a gift was to know that I had given up my homosexual demons and come back to the Lord.  By then I was in my 20s, living in NYC, and financially independent, but the first time she railed at me, I was barely into my teens, living under their roof, and sitting beside her in church every Saturday (culty Seventh Day Adventists).  So, I tried to commit suicide a few times to escape her judgement every day.  Luckily I was unsuccessful, but a teacher with misplaced concern basically almost killed me.

And I will fight them all*  so im not at all surprised that Yi is the 118th most common last name and there are more than 4 million people that share it…. tbh its really nice and i feel very connected right now  Only 1,245 have my surname. That’s still a lot more than I thought there would be…  less than 800 people out of 7 billion have my surname which was surprising until i remembered that my surname isn’t real, but a bastardization of my family’s actual name that was altered at ellis island for being “too ethnic”  332,831 people have my surname.I’m honestly surprised my mother’s surname, Southworth, is less common by a large amount.   apparently there’s only 20 people in the world with my surname (although this doesn’t include variations of it that are spelled differently but pronounced the same way)  about  224,581 people share my surname.  i thought it would be more   Only 16 people have my surname :) " False link
