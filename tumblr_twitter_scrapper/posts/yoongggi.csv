I feel like this goes for the rest of the members too. It may seem like they don‚Äôt understand, but I think that‚Äôs just because they‚Äôre nervous and in the moment they can‚Äôt really think of how to respond properly since so many people are watching them and they don‚Äôt want to make a mistake. If they actually had the luxury of taking their time to process and think of a response, they would definitely be more confident in speaking also now that we know the boys understand more english than they let on, please be careful of the things you put on the internet out of pure ignorance‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ bangtan is obviously known for their social media presence but I really fear that one day that won‚Äôt be the case due to some stupid fuck who decides it would be fun to send them a rude/sexual/inappropriate/threatening message. constant communication with their fans through social media isn‚Äôt something they‚Äôre forced to do. they literally WANT to interact with us as much as they can even though it would be so much easier to lay low and keep their personal lives private. please don‚Äôt be the reason bangtan becomes hesitant to communicate with their own fans. show some respect.
