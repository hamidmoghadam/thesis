Специально для выступлений певицы создавались наряды, а в 2011 года бренд решил запустить целую коллекцию, посвященную рыжей диве, а модели в рыжих париках штурмовали подиум  -Флоренс утверждает, что с детства видела призраков. В десятилетнем возрасте она так боялась вампиров и оборотней, что предпочитала спать в одной постели с младшей сестрой Грейс.   -Первая группа Флоренс называлась “Toxic Cockroaches” (т.е. «токсичные тараканы»).  Если честно, Флоренс мне понравилась больше, чем 30STM, я и раньше слушала ее.  Ее музыка мне как-то ближе, приятнее. Видимо все зависит от натуры. Кто-то любит позажигать от души, потусить по Лето и будет кайф, а мне видимо больше по душе лиричность, спокойствие, некая сказочность.Все альбомы по - своему красивые.   How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful немного отличается от первых двух, даже не могу понять чем, но как будто даже энергетика другая. Lungs и    Ceremonials чудесные, очень душевные, тонкие. Особенно понравились песни:   Drumming Song,   Between Two Lungs,   Blinding,   Bird Song,   No Light, No Light,   Never Let Me Go,   Seven Devils,   Leave My Body,   Breath Of Life, и это далеко не весь список, уж очень они мне по душе.  Если честно, под ее песни хочется гулять по лесам, горам, ходить по берегу моря, мечтать, размышлять о жизни. Словно ее песни делают тебя ближе к природе, к себе. @eva-h​ ты права, Florence обалденные!!Что я буду слушать следующим пока не решила, с радостью приму ваши предложения:)) " False text

Not all resource grinders are raiders, not all raiders are mount collectors, not all mount collectors are quest completers, etc etc. Overwatch is pretty straight forward “You’re here for stats, fun and lootboxes.”) I can’t think of a god damn game that updates that much without charging you over $120 in DLC content or microtransactions by force of the pay-to-win methodology …or that doesn’t just drop off the face of the earth because no one wants to play it anymore.  It was literally years I’m pretty sure before you could fucking replant trees in Starbound.  It took Game Freak 5 years from the release of Poke’mon to give us animated battles.

The game was played across Central America before being banned by the Spanish conquistadors. The tournament, only the second since 2006, is being played by ten teams from across Mexico. According to ancient texts the ball game was seen as a struggle between light and darkness and provided the energy to keep humanity going.   One of the best preserved ball courts can be found - with stone rings to throw the ball through - in Mexico’s Yucatan peninsula   Today the game is played by teams of seven players, who knock a heavy solid rubber ball up and down a narrow pitch, using their hips rather than their feet. Giant ball courts can still be seen in ruins across the region. In ancient times losers of the game were often sacrificed to the Gods*, but this year organisers opted for a knockout tournament instead. *  There is iconography and mythology related to the ballgame that involve sacrifice, but there is little evidence that people were sacrificed for having played this game.

They are tortured with electric currents and heavily beaten, sometimes to death.”  I don’t have words. Amnesty International is circulating a petition seeking justice.

On Wednesday, the massive adult entertainment destination took the  somewhat surprising step of launching the “Pornhub Sexual Health  Center.”  They’re hoping the free sub-site  will become a go-to resource for some of their 70 million daily users  on all manner of topics, including STIs, sexual safety and how to manage  relationships. They’ve chosen Dr. Laurie Betito, a renowned sex therapist, to direct  the site and they’ll also be working with a number of doctors,  therapists and other experts to offer advice and answer questions.  Corey  Price, Pornhub’s Vice President, told Mashable, “Our goal is  to provide our visitors with a site that has credible and insightful  information, rather than have them scouring the internet.” While it’s a database they’ll build up over time, a first look  reveals they’ve started with the fundamentals — with answers to things  like “Babies. Where do they come from?” and “Are there really three  holes?”  These might seems almost laughably basic to adult consumers of  hardcore porn, but there are a lot of young people for whom these are  very real questions.  Price told Mashable they weren’t aiming the content  specifically at beginners.  He said they simply want to appeal to “those  who are looking for trustworthy sex tips and health advice provided by  experts.”  But it seems like they realize this could prove to be an  especially valuable resource for their younger audience, who most likely  isn’t getting comprehensive (much less sex-positive) sex ed in schools. There are, of course, plenty of online sexual health and education  resources, but for many kids, landing on sites like Pornhub is already  their way into learning about sex.  Porn can obviously teach you plenty  about the basics and mechanics of intercourse, but there’s a whole range  of other things — biology, health, consent, relating to intimate  partners, just to name a few — that you won’t pick up from watching  videos like “Big tits round asses” or “Sloppy throat games.”  So if they can slide their curious audience over to the PSHC while  they’re already on the site, it could function as pretty useful one-stop  shop for filling in the blanks left by spotty sex ed classes and the  birds and bees talks given by often bewildered parents.   Neat!  Holy shit their section on trans people was actually really good and not what I expected from something hosted by a porn site! If they had a containing various sexualities and whatnot as well, they’ll definitely have a good resource on their hands!  when a god damn porn site has better information about trans health than most school systems  " False link
