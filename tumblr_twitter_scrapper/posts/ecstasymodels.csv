Waking up to the horror of your headscarf having slipped off in the middle of the night. 2. Trying to sleep with a fresh head of braids. 3. Or trying to tie your hair up within the first week of getting your braids done and wincing in agony. 4. Feeling a strange amount of anxiety every time you have to book a hair appointment, even though you’ve been booking hair appointments for several years. 5. Relentlessly scratching your scalp all week and then realising your mistake as soon as you get your hair relaxed. 6. Going to the toilet half way through getting your extensions done and finding hair in the most random crevices of your body. 7. Being given the painstaking task of having to pass your stylist the hair. 8. Being convinced to get a trim you definitely don’t want. 9. And then having your trust betrayed when your stylist takes three inches off and gives you a CUT instead. 10. Never being quite sure if the prices in your salon are set or entirely made up every time. 11. Being forced to cancel a plan because your stylist can only do your hair on Saturday at 11am. 12. Fake scratching the back of your hair to check the kind of progress you’re making. 13. And touching the little tuft of hair at the top of your head after six long hours and thinking you only have two braids left when you actually have 20. 14. Forgetting to bring enough food to the salon and having to mask the sound of your stomach rumbling. 15. Or eating all of your provisions in the first two hours and realising you’ve been a fool. 16. Having your phone die halfway through your hair appointment. 17. When your stylist takes a break from your head every 15 minutes to have a conversation with their mate. 18. Or to chat on the phone. 19. Or to tend to their kids. 20. Or to do all three, while eating a plate of food. 21. Being told to come to the salon at 1pm and seeing two people in front of you when you arrive. 22. Being told to come to the salon at 9am and they haven’t even opened the shop yet. 23. Feeling the heat catch the oil on your scalp as your hair’s being straightened. 24. Having your weave so tight that you can’t put your eyebrows down. 25. Breaking the hairdryer pick when your hair’s only half dry. 26. Snapping a comb in half while tending to the thickest part of your head. 27. Having your wig slip back a little too far and only realising several hours into the day when you check the mirror in the toilet. 28. Or wearing your wig on a particularly windy day and praying that it doesn’t get swept off your head. 29. Feeling the ache in your muscles and actually sweating while detangling your hair. 30. Procrastinating on washing your hair and then having to start the process of washing, deep conditioning, and detangling your hair at 10pm. 31. Feeling very dubious about your new stylist and asking them a trillion questions to make sure they don’t mess up your hair. 32. Or realising they’re not quite doing your hair the way you want, but being too scared to say anything. 33. Having to do the duck and dive when someone tries to touch your hair. 34. Being asked if you cut your hair or “grew it” when you go into work with a new hairstyle. 35. Being asked if that’s your “real hair” and having to stop yourself from screaming “I BOUGHT IT, SO HELL YEAH IT’S MINE.” 36. Coming out of the salon when it’s raining and having to put a plastic bag over your head because you have no umbrella. 37. Hearing the words “hold your ear” just before the hot comb narrowly misses burning it off. 38. Trying to scratch underneath your weave discreetly with a pencil or pen. 39. Or accidentally slapping your head so hard to itch your scalp that you almost knock yourself out in the process. 40. Watching shrinkage claim the length of your hair as soon as you wash it. 41. Being asked to have a sleepover on a whim and refusing because you don’t have your headscarf. 42. Sitting under the dryer for so long that you forget what life was like before you basically lived under it. 43. And when the dryer finally cuts off, but your hairdresser tells you “ten more minutes”. 44. When you have to wash your hair in the kitchen sink and feel like your neck is gonna fall off at any minute. 45. Having extra long weave or braids and getting it caught in every zip, door or piece of velcro you come into contact with. 46. Using more ingredients to wash your hair than you do when cooking yourself an actual meal. 47. Struggling to fit a hat over your afro and wondering why you bothered trying in the first place. 48. Falling asleep without your headscarf and waking up out of your sleep to put it on. 49. Watching someone who came to the salon after you leave before you. 50. Having to reject plans on wash day. 51. Having to reject plans on “taking out my braids” day. 52. Having to reject plans when you’ve already put your satin bonnet on. 53. Showing your stylist a picture of what you want and having them completely ignore you to do their own thing. That’s 53 reasons why i hate when white people are trying to copy our natural hairstyles or the hairstyles that have been invented by back people to cope with their hair. They’re doing this without thinking that they’re doing something wrong and pretend like they are so fresh and stylish giving no f**ks about cultural appropriation. If you still don’t think cultural appropriation is wrong re read 53 points above. Source " False text

As a Rocket Structural Design and Analysis Engineer for the Space Launch System that aerospace company Boeing is building for NASA, Guinn designs and analyzes parts of a rocket that she said will be one of the biggest and most powerful in history.  Have you already watched Hidden Figures? Tiera’s story closely resembles that of Mary Jackson who was played by Janelle Monae in the award-winning film.   Her mother noticed her daughter’s math skills and made her practice…   at the supermarket.      “When [my mom and I] would go to the grocery store, she would get me to clip coupons [and] put it in my coupon organizer,” Guinn told WBRC News. “By the time we got to the register, I’d have to calculate the exact total, including tax. And I did that since I was six years old.”   Then one day she realised she can possibly design    planes and she can    be an aerospace engineer. And now she is a NASA engineer at the age of 22!  And she will soon be graduating from MIT with a 5.0 GPA! What an incredible story! She follows her dreams and doesn’t let anyone to get in her way. A few decades ago she wouldn’t be even allowed to take a step into the building of NASA and now she’s an engineer there. Hidden Figures showed us how hard it was for Mary Jackson, Katherine Johnson, and Dorothy Vaughan  and these women paved a way for us. She is a great role model for all the beautiful young black girls. Everything is possible! SOURCE VIDEO SOURCE " False text

ecstasymodels 152958084204 "2016-11-09 18:11:01 GMT" http://ecstasymodel.com/post/152958084204/nism-yprofile-nengi-willie-pepple "nismypro:  Nengi has always loved all things creative. She recalls being drawn to colours and scribbling from a very young age.  “I’ve always been a lover of arts and crafts. Even when I was little, I always played with crayons, writing on walls, everything. I just wanted to express myself creatively.” This stuck with her from her childhood in Port Harcourt, and persisted through to her secondary school education in Adesoye College, Offa – a boarding school in Kwara State. Nengi might have been a long way from home, but her natural instincts and talents never left her. Her current occupation as a fashion and lifestyle blogger is therefore no surprise, but the journey to this point wasn’t so straightforward. When she was younger, Nengi was never good with numbers and this plagued her with a nagging sense of self-doubt.  “I’m not saying everyone who is great at art isn’t good at science, but that was definitely the case for me. I just didn’t understand Maths or Physics or anything like that. It was a real struggle for me. Eventually, I just started to embrace it more and tried my best, but I knew I didn’t understand or enjoy Maths and those other subjects.” Some would argue that Nengi’s experience is not unique within the Nigerian educational system. Many experience an unspoken bias towards the sciences, which comes with a hefty dose of pressure. The perception that art subjects offer an easy alternative to more technical subjects causes a good number of creative students to neglect their natural gifts in favour of more respected fields of study. Admittedly, this bias is likely to come from a place of concern – science subjects often lend themselves more readily to specific professions than creative disciplines. Study medicine and become a doctor. Study engineering and your path is clear. Study fashion design and textiles and become… A tailor, perhaps? Even with a great support system, a decision that goes against the grain of favoured traditional subjects could be a difficult one to come to terms with.  Ultimately, Nengi put these worries aside and followed her instincts. Following a move to the UK, she opted to study Textiles and Photography at GCSE level - two subjects which would become integral aspects of her future career. “That was my first taste of what fashion was – sewing, putting together garments. Even in uni, some of the stuff I did wasn’t as complex as what I did back then. I didn’t even know I was going to end up using Photography.”  Nengi hasn’t looked back since. She continued her study of Textile Design at A Level, and went on to pursue a BA in the same subject at Leeds University. It was an incredibly robust degree, consisting of weaving, embroidery, knitwear and print in the first year of study, before students were encouraged to specialise in one skill by their second year. In addition to the hands-on nature of the course, it was also academically rigorous.  “It wasn’t just ‘Create, create, create! Make, make, make!’. It was also ‘learn and write’.”   As a result, Nengi received thorough training in the practical techniques involved in garment production, as well as sound instruction regarding the fashion industry and the various business models on offer within it. Her studies at Leeds culminated in a dissertation exploring the emergence and impact of sweat shops. Nengi submitted her final paper and graduated in 2014. She then faced the same question many graduates have to answer: “What do I do now?” Being the hard worker that she is, her response to this question was to hit the ground running. Straight after graudation,  Nengi completed a two month internship at Moschino, another one at Diane von Furstenberg and also gained some work experience at Paul Smith. Working for these household names has furnished her with invaluable experience.   “You get to see the back-end of things. I went to the Moschino fashion show for menswear. That was really helpful for me. I [also] really look up to [Diane] as a woman in fashion. She’s come a long way and has done a lot for herself.” This experience only served to bolster Nengi’s on-going project. In 2012, she had started a blog to document her personal style and had been running it alongside full-time study. She admits that she never took blogging seriously to begin with.  “In my mind, all I could do was get a job. I never thought I could do it for a living.” Yet, over time, her love for blogging only waxed stronger. However, with graduation comes that all-important foray into adult life. That life came with responsibilities and the blog was not sufficient to cater to these, so Nengi got a job.  “I got a full-time job at Selfridges. I was a Sales Associate in the Luxury handbags department.”  As is the case with anyone who has already discovered their passion, no alternative could fully compare.  Nengi was never truly fulfilled being a Sales Associate. She was experiencing a dilemma many talented young people face: continue a steady 9-5 or pursue your dream? Nengi found a solution in between, and now splits her time between a part-time sales role and her duties as the creative director of her blog. Though she hopes to transition towards the latter outright, she doesn’t regret a minute of her sales role.  “I can definitely say I learned a lot of customer service skills, but my blog was suffering, so I went down to part-time and my blog has definitely grown since.”  That blog is Runway Ribbons – a thriving lifestyle, fashion and beauty website with a burgeoning social media presence to boot. Nengi has almost 5,000 followers on Instagram – an eager audience for her stylish outfit posts, travelogues and musings. Her unique selling point is achieving high fashion looks with high street brands. Settling into this niche came with quite a few growing pains. The fashion industry is often seen as synonymous with pressure to follow expensive trends and subscribe to narrow beauty standards. At first, Nengi was not immune to any of this.  “I was in this industry where everyone had all these amazing things and I just couldn’t afford it. I really wondered how I could take myself to the next level if I didn’t have the right bag or the right shoes.” It took some frank words from her mother to counter these negative feelings.  “My mum said, ‘If you have all those things now, what will be there to aspire to?’.”  Since then, Nengi has decided to march to the beat of her own drum. She is a firm believer that success means different things to different people, and one’s focus should remain centred on being one’s best self – and not competing with others. One of her favourite quotes is “Comparison is the thief of joy” – a mantra she lives her life by. Still, Nengi is human, and she still has days when she wonders if she should have taken a more traditional path.  “I’ve had those moments when you rethink it and wonder if this is going to go anywhere.” This is where a strong support system comes in handy. Nengi credits friends and family with giving her the final push to take her career to the next level. From crafting unique and edgy outfits by putting high street pieces together, Nengi’s next goal is to design and produce her own garments.   “My friends were always telling me, ‘Why aren’t you designing? Why aren’t you making your own clothes?’ Even my mum told me, ‘You have a sewing machine, why aren’t you using it?’.” These little sparks of encouragement were eventually ignited by a chance window shopping encounter.  “One day, I saw a top in Zara and it was £30. I just knew it shouldn’t be so I went home and made the exact same top for like £5 pounds and it took me 20 minutes! That definitely made me think.” That top became the first of a few, one of which is pictured above, and Nengi intends to keep designing and making her own items. Her passion for the craft is palpable – she stresses the utmost importance of excellent finishing and takes pride in personally selecting the right fabrics for different designs. She sees her talent as a ready fix for a gap in the market – many bloggers collaborate with clothing brands but rarely make or design their own clothes. With the skill to do so and an impressive platform to promote her products, Nengi might just be on her way to becoming a household name. Her plans for the future are much more modest.  “I wish I could have a job that would allow me to travel the world. I’d be the owner and designer of my own company. I would like a small team; it doesn’t have to be too big. I just want my clothes to be out there and making a mark.”  We’ll be watching this budding talent as she flourishes on the fashion scene. In the meantime, keep up-to-date with her on her blog and social media platforms. " False text

You don’t see her hobbling around in broken heels or rushing to remove a stain from her blouse because she’s ready for such obstacles.Primp and PrepPlanning your outfit the night before is crucial to looking great the next morning. You may think you know exactly what you want to wear the next day, only to find that the one piece you really wanted is still in last week’s laundry. Pulling out your clothes the night before ensures that you have a complete outfit and eliminates the morning panic to find a replacement.Even though your outfit is already prepared, you still need to give yourself plenty of time to get ready in the morning. You never know when a shirt might rip or a heel may break! Take the extra time to fix your hair, do your makeup, and select your jewelry.The right undergarments are often the hallmark of a well dressed woman. Choosing the silhouette that best suits your outfit helps you avoid awkward wrinkles, lumps, and lines. They’ll also provide appropriate support and coverage for any occasion.Compulsory Closet ComponentsMany women struggle to maintain stylish outfits due to a lack of certain wardrobe essentials. Slacks and stylish pants in black and charcoal, in addition to a comfortable long sleeve woven shirt, are often the base for a chic ensemble. Without well fitting basic pieces, you won’t be able to create the look you desire.An important aspect of closet basics is color choice. A closet full of neutrals that are easily mixed and matched allow you the versatility to create an outfit out of anything you own. If you add just a few statement pieces to your wardrobe essentials, polished, office-ready clothes are always available.Accurate AccessoriesSometimes a simple outfit is elevated with colorful statement necklaces or elegant hand embroidered scarves. If you’re keeping your outfit neutral during work hours, matching accessories enhances the effortless feel of your clothes and adds elegance and sophistication. One thing that will always elevate your outfit and mood is finding one piece that you can wear with everything. A diamond ring or estate earrings are enough to sensationalize your attire any day.Quick FixesThere are always days when everything seems to be going wrong: a pet got sick on your work uniform, you tripped and fell on the grass, or your clothes ripped on the way to work. Prepare for these emergencies with a few quick fixes. Stashing an extra outfit in the car or office is a lifesaver. You can also carry an emergency sewing kit and bleach pen in your purse for minor messes and holes.Stylish Working WomanFollowing these simple tips will turn you into the new office fashionista.
