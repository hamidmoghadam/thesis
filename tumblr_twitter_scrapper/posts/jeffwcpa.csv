Known as puquios, their origin has been a puzzle ‚Äì one that could only be solved from space. The holes are from the Nasca region of Peru ‚Äì an area famous for the Nasca lines, several enormous geometric images carved into the landscape; immaculate archaeological evidence of ceremonial burials; and the rapid decline of this once flourishing society. What adds to the intrigue in the native ancient people of Nasca is how they were able to survive in an area where droughts can last for years at a time. The puquios were a ‚Äúsophisticated hydraulic system constructed to retrieve water from underground aquifers,‚Äù says Rosa Lasaponara of the Institute of Methodologies for Environmental Analysis, in Italy. And they transformed this inhospitable region.   The funnel-like shape helped to draw the wind down into the underground canals    Lasaponara and her team studied the puquios using satellite imaging. From this, the team were able to better understand how the puquios were distributed across the Nasca region, and where they ran in relation to nearby settlements ‚Äì which are easier to date. ‚ÄúWhat is clearly evident today is that the puquio system must have been much more developed than it appears today,‚Äù says Lasaponara. ‚ÄúExploiting an inexhaustible water supply throughout the year the puquio system contributed to an intensive agriculture of the valleys in one of the most arid places in the world.‚Äù A series of canals brought the water, trapped underground, to the areas where it was needed; anything left was stored in surface reservoirs. To help keep it moving, chimneys were excavated above the canals in the shape of corkscrewing funnels. These funnels let wind into the canals, which forced the water through the system. ‚ÄúThe puquios were the most ambitious hydraulic project in the Nasca area and made water available for the whole year, not only for agriculture and irrigation but also for domestic needs,‚Äù says Lasaponara, who has written about her satellite studies in Ancient Nasca World: New Insights from Science and Archaeology, which is due to be published later this year. The origin of the puquios has remained a mystery to researchers because it was not possible to use traditional carbon dating techniques on the tunnels. Nor did the Nasca leave any clues as to their origin. Like many other South American cultures they had no writing system.   Some think the famous ‚ÄòNasca lines‚Äô related to the presence of water     Their existence tells us something remarkable about the people who lived in the Nasca region from before 1,000 BC to AD750. ‚ÄúThe construction of the puquios involved the use of particularly specialised technology,‚Äù says Lasaponara. Not only did the builders of the puquios need a deep understanding of the geology of the area and annual variations in water availability, maintaining the canals was a technical challenge as they spread across tectonic faults.   ‚ÄúWhat is really impressive is the great efforts, organisation and cooperation required for their construction and regular maintenance,‚Äù she says. That meant a regular dependable water supply for centuries, in an area that‚Äôs one of the most arid places on Earth. ‚ÄúMaintenance was likely based on a collaborative and socially organised system, similar to that adopted for the construction of the famous ‚ÄôNasca lines‚Äò which in some cases are clearly related to the presence of water.‚Äù The quality of construction was so good, that some of the puquios still function today. These structures show the native people of the Nasca basin were not only highly organised, but that their society was structured in a hierarchy, says Lasaponara. She says the puquios were vital in ‚Äúcontrolling water distribution by those in power over the communities that came under their influence.‚Äù Knowing how to bring water to one of the driest places on earth means that you hold the very key to life itself.  Why can‚Äôt I read historical fiction about this.  ^^^^ I‚Äôm still wondering They built an elaborate irritation system over a thousand years ago. We elected trump." False link

JWST is considered the successor to NASA‚Äôs iconic Hubble Space Telescope.‚ÄúToday, we‚Äôre celebrating the fact that our telescope is finished, and we‚Äôre about to prove that it works,‚Äù said John Mather, an astrophysicist and senior project scientist for the telescope. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve done two decades of innovation and hard work, and this is the result ‚Äî we‚Äôre opening up a whole new territory of astronomy.‚ÄùThe telescope will be much more powerful than even Hubble for two main reasons, Mather said at the conference.

However, there was a time when English speakers would wend to all kinds of places. ‚ÄúWend‚Äù was just another word for ‚Äúgo‚Äù in Old English. The past tense of ‚Äúwend‚Äù was ‚Äúwent‚Äù and the past tense of ‚Äúgo‚Äù was ‚Äúgaed.‚Äù People used both until the 15th century, when ‚Äúgo‚Äù became the preferred verb, except in the past tense where ‚Äúwent‚Äù hung on, leaving us with an outrageously irregular verb.   deserts The ‚Äúdesert‚Äù from the phrase ‚Äújust deserts‚Äù is not the dry and sandy kind, nor the sweet post-dinner kind. It comes from an Old French word for ‚Äúdeserve,‚Äù and it was used in English from the 13th century to mean ‚Äúthat which is deserved.‚Äù When you get your just deserts, you get your due. In some cases, that may mean you also get dessert, a word that comes from a later French borrowing.   eke If we see ‚Äúeke‚Äù at all these days, it‚Äôs when we ‚Äúeke out‚Äù a living, but it comes from an old verb meaning to add, supplement, or grow. It‚Äôs the same word that gave us ‚Äúeke-name‚Äù for ‚Äúadditional name,‚Äù which later, through misanalysis of ‚Äúan eke-name‚Äù became ‚Äúnickname.‚Äù   sleight ‚ÄúSleight of hand‚Äù is one tricky phrase. ‚ÄúSleight‚Äù is often miswritten as ‚Äúslight‚Äù and for good reason. Not only does the expression convey an image of light, nimble fingers, which fits well with the smallness implied by ‚Äúslight,‚Äù but an alternate expression for the concept is ‚Äúlegerdemain,‚Äù from the French l√©ger de main,‚Äú literally, ‚Äúlight of hand.‚Äù ‚ÄúSleight‚Äù comes from a different source, a Middle English word meaning ‚Äúcunning‚Äù or ‚Äútrickery.‚Äù It‚Äôs a wily little word that lives up to its name.    roughshod Nowadays we see this word in the expression ‚Äúto run/ride roughshod‚Äù over somebody or something, meaning to tyrannize or treat harshly. It came about as a way to describe the 17th century version of snow tires. A ‚Äúrough-shod‚Äù horse had its shoes attached with protruding nail heads in order to get a better grip on slippery roads. It was great for keeping the horse on its feet, but not so great for anyone the horse might step on.   fro The ‚Äúfro‚Äù in ‚Äúto and fro‚Äù is a fossilized remnant of a Northern English or Scottish way of pronouncing ‚Äúfrom.‚Äù It was also part of other expressions that didn‚Äôt stick around, like ‚Äúfro and till,‚Äù ‚Äúto do fro‚Äù (to remove), and ‚Äúof or fro‚Äù (for or against).   hue The ‚Äúhue‚Äù of ‚Äúhue and cry,‚Äù the expression for the noisy clamor of a crowd, is not the same ‚Äúhue‚Äù as the term we use for color. The color one comes from the Old English word h√≠ew, for ‚Äúappearance.‚Äù This hue comes from the Old French hu or heu, which was basically an onomatopoeia, like ‚Äúhoot.‚Äù   lurch When you leave someone ‚Äúin the lurch,‚Äù you leave them in a jam, in a difficult position. But while getting left in the lurch may leave you staggering around and feeling off-balance, the ‚Äúlurch‚Äù in this expression has a different origin than the staggery one. The balance-related lurch comes from nautical vocabulary, while the lurch you get left in comes from an old French backgammon-style game called lourche. Lurch became a general term for the situation of beating your opponent by a huge score. By extension it came to stand for the state of getting the better of someone or cheating them.   umbrage ‚ÄúUmbrage‚Äù comes from the Old French ombrage (shade, shadow), and it was once used to talk about actual shade from the sun. It took on various figurative meanings having to do with doubt and suspicion or the giving and taking of offense. To give umbrage was to offend someone, to ‚Äúthrow shade.‚Äù However, these days when we see the term ‚Äúumbrage‚Äù at all, it is more likely to be because someone is taking, rather than giving it.   shrift We might not know what a shrift is anymore, but we know we don‚Äôt want to get a short one. ‚ÄúShrift‚Äù was a word for a confession, something it seems we might want to keep short, or a penance imposed by a priest, something we would definitely want to keep short. But the phrase ‚Äúshort shrift‚Äù came from the practice of allowing a little time for the condemned to make a confession before being executed. So in that context, shorter was not better.    I love this stuff.  I love linguistics. " False link
