Like, I feel like most shows depict unhealthy romantic relationships with internal conflict, in which characters fight and lie to each other and break up and make up over and over again. For some reason, a lot of writers seem to think that internal conflict is the only way to add drama to an established relationship. But Brooklyn Nine-Nine? After the initial will-they-won’t-they dramatics, Jake and Amy are nothing but supportive of each other at every step in their relationship. Jake doesn’t resent Amy for being ambitious. Amy doesn’t resent Jake for being a hot mess. They communicate with each other. They affirm each other. The most relationship conflict we’ve seen is when they get separated by external circumstances (Florida and now prison, apparently). tl;dr: I wish more writers would realize that you can write interesting romantic pairings without relying on unhealthy relationship tropes.

Cabinet Office figures show that a total of 622,000 people registered to vote on 22 May, of which 246,000 were under 25.  Young people were dominant among those registering, with 207,000 aged 25 to 34 – compared to just 10,000 people over the age of 65.  Anyone who registers to vote after 22 May will not be eligible to vote in the general election on 8 June. The 620,000 figure is up from an average of about 100,000 a day throughout the last week, itself up on about 30,000 a day since the general election was called in April. The figures should only be treated as indicative because there is no easy way to check whether you are registered to vote, meaning some people who signed up may have already been registered.  Young people are also far more likely to live in private rented accommodation and thus have to move house frequently, which would require them to re-register. As well as the surge on Monday, more than 200,000 people in total applied on Sunday, with a similar age split. The statistics could be good news for Labour, which is far more popular among young people than it is among older people. The spike comes after a huge voter registration drive that saw social networks including Facebook and Snapchat encourage their users to register to vote. Musicians ranging from Pink Floyd frontman David Gilmour to grime artist JME also urged people to register. One scheme offered voters free Grime concert tickets if they signed up.  Kenny Imafidon, of the Bite The Ballot campaign said: “In the past week alone we have seen over half a million under 24 year olds apply to register to vote.”  Read More  Holy shit. seriously if these people go out and vote it could save the day @ailedhoo  To all folk who registered in the UK… Please, for the love of all… GET OUT TO VOTE ON POLLING DAY!

Mom earned two back-to-back supporting actress wins for one of its central stars, Allison Janney—in 2014 and 2015. (She was nominated in 2016, but lost out to Saturday Night Live’s Kate McKinnon.) But this year, rather than throw down cash for yet another campaign for gold statuettes, CBS will donate the budgeted funds to Planned Parenthood. As the Republicans continue to work toward pushing through their replacement for the Affordable Care Act, Janney and Mom co-creator/executive producer Chuck Lorre have decided to raise awareness around the threats that specifically target Planned Parenthood, Variety reports. (The version of the American Health Care Act that passed in the House includes a provision that would slash funding for the organization.) They’ll appear on CBS This Morning as part of their special Mom campaign, encouraging their fans to donate to the organization. (Vanity Fair has reached out to Janney, her co-star Anna Faris, and Lorre for comment, and will update this post accordingly.) Although the move to forego campaigning is extremely rare, such decisions could become more mainstream over the next few years. As Variety notes, United Talent Agency canceled its 2017 Oscars party in protest of Donald Trump, choosing instead to donate $250,000 to the A.C.L.U. and the humanitarian organization International Rescue Committee.

But even more remarkably, Rowe was cast in the role of Christopher, a 15-year-old with autism spectrum disorder. Having been diagnosed with autism at age 21, Rowe is one of the first actors with autism to play a character with autism on a major professional stage ― and the very first to play Christopher in the critically-acclaimed show set to premiere this fall at the Indiana Repertory Theatre before traveling to New York’s Syracuse Stage, an achievement the Broadway production was never able to pull off. …   In an email to HuffPost, Rowe explained how living with autism not only prepared him for his role as Christopher, but his life as an actor. “Autistics use scripts every day,” he wrote. “We use scripting for daily situations that we can predict the outcome of, and stick to those scripts. My job as an autistic is to make you believe that I am coming up with words on the spot, that this is spontaneous, the first time the conversation has ever happened in my life; this is also my job on stage as an actor.”   " False link

The Russian newspaper says it confirmed the news with government officials and an analyst of the region also confirmed the news to the Times with her own sources. Three men are known to have been murdered, although the real number is likely to be higher.  in almost every genocide, the first “act” is the rounding up and killing of a group of men, specifically.  In “root and branch” genocides they [”civilian men of ‘battle age’”] are often the first group to be separated out and massacred, paving the way for the murder of women, children, and elderly men. In more common articulations of genocide, however, they can be the only group slated for outright massacre, while women, children, and elderly men suffer a range of alternative fates involving rape, sexual exploitation, torture, forced maternity, murder, and expulsion. Gender and the Future of Genocide Studies and Prevention   as the rest of this article explains this isn’t to say that men have it worst in a genocide, but that it’s important when you see a very common red flag for genocide to pay attention to the “conflict” in case any more markers of an impending genocide occur.  the g word is really loaded and i’m not bringing this up because i want to start an avalanche of “CHECHNYA IS COMMITTING GENOCIDE AGAINST GAY PEOPLE” fear mongering (that is the absolute last thing that i want). it’s just not possible to prevent any genocide without questioning whether a current conflict might eventually get there. and i do not think it’s nothing that genocide watch is reporting on this.  UPDATE 4/10/17 Chechnya has opened concentration camps for gay men   Gay men arrested in a ‘purge’ in the Russian region of Chechnya are being held in concentration camp-style prisons, reports have alleged. Early reports emerged earlier this month that gay people are being targeted in the region, which is part of Russia but has substantial autonomy. Russian newspapers and human rights groups report that more than 100 gay men have been detained “in connection with their non-traditional sexual orientation, or suspicion of such” as part of a purge. Several people were also reportedly feared dead following violent raids. In a chilling response, a Chechen government spokesperson denied that there are any gay people to detain, insisting that “you can’t detain and harass someone who doesn’t exist in the republic”. The Kremlin denied any knowledge of a purge. But reports have since emerged that the men arrested are being kept in horrific concentration camp prisons, where violent abuse and torture is common. Based on interviews with eyewitnesses and survivors, Novaya Gazeta reports that a secret prison has been set up in the town of Argun to detain the men arrested in the purge. One man who was released from the camp told the newspaper that he was subjected to violent “interrogations” at the camp, as Chechen officials attempted to get him to confess the names and locations of more gay men. The officials also seized his mobile phone, targeting his network of contacts regardless of whether they were gay or not. The camp was reportedly set up by Chechen forces in a former military headquarters in the town. The newspaper reports allegations that the Speaker of the Parliament of Chechnya was among officials to visit the site, though the claims have not been substantiated. The detainees face electric shock torture and violent beatings, while some of them have been held to ransom and used to extort their families. Tanya Lokshina of Human Rights Watch wrote: “For several weeks now, a brutal campaign against LGBT people has been sweeping through Chechnya. She continued: “Law enforcement and security agency officials under control of the ruthless head of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, have rounded up dozens of men on suspicion of being gay, torturing and humiliating the victims. “Some of the men have forcibly disappeared. Others were returned to their families barely alive from beatings. At least three men apparently have died since this brutal campaign began.” She added: “These days, very few people in Chechnya dare speak to human rights monitors or journalists even anonymously because the climate of fear is overwhelming and people have been largely intimidated into silence. “Filing an official complaint against local security officials is extremely dangerous, as retaliation by local authorities is practically inevitable. “It is difficult to overstate just how vulnerable LGBT people are in Chechnya, where homophobia is intense and rampant. “LGBT people are in danger not only of persecution by the authorities but also of falling victim to ‘honour killings’ by their own relatives for tarnishing family honour.” What Can We Do?   Alexander Artmyev from Amnesty International spoke to Metro.co.uk. He said that people who are not in Russia can help by joining the charity’s Urgent Action on Chechnya. The action encourages people to write in Russian or your own language to Chairman of the Investigation Committee and Acting Head of the Investigation Committee for the Chechen Republic. Amnesty has also asked the letter, which should ask for an investigation and appeal for protection for LGBT individuals, to be copied into Human Rights groups and diplomatic missions from your country.

By Sunday night, dozens of strangers were messaging her that she is a criminal and a liar, and that they reported her to be deported. Sisa, 23, is a “dreamer” — her parents visited the U.S. from Argentina when she was 6 and overstayed their visas — but she is shielded from deportation by President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. DACA allows young undocumented immigrants without serious criminal records who were brought to the U.S. as children to register their personal information with the government, and in exchange receive federal work permits and a two-year reprieve from the threat of deportation, which allows them to get a Social Security number and a driver’s license. “I was hoping to kind of make a statement and educate people. What you’ve known all this time isn’t the truth,” Sisa said Monday morning. Speaking out for dreamers Sisa is an outspoken advocate for dreamers: In 2015 she wrote a popular opinion piece pressing Arizona leaders to grant in-state tuition to dreamers. Last year she served as a page at the Democratic National Convention, even though she can’t vote. “I decided to post it basically to bust the myth that immigrants don’t contribute and they don’t pay taxes to this country,” she said.  She said she filed state and federal taxes and, in the end, paid $300 to the state. She publicly posted a photo of herself holding a Form 1040 along with this caption: “MYTH BUSTER: I, an undocumented immigrant, just filed my taxes and PAID $300 to the state of Arizona. I cannot receive financial aid from the state or federal government for school, I cannot benefit from unemployment, a reduced healthcare plan, or a retirement fund. I think I’m a pretty good citizen. Oh and there are MILLIONS just like me who pay into a system they will never receive anything from. Wanna tell me again how I should be deported, contribute nothing and only leech off this country while the 1% wealthiest people in this country steal from you everyday? How about you show me yours Donald J. Trump? #HereToStay” […] More on immigration and taxes Although the issues of tax contributions and economic impact of immigrants without legal status are complicated, some non-partisan organizations have worked to analyze the matter. The 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States in 2013 collectively paid an estimated $11.64 billion a year in state and local taxes, including sales, property and personal-income taxes, according to a report last year from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. “The best evidence suggests that at least 50 percent of undocumented immigrant households currently file income tax returns using Individual Tax Identification Numbers (ITINs), and many who do not file income tax returns still have taxes deducted from their paychecks,” the study stated. Stephen Goss, the chief actuary of the Social Security Administration, told The Atlantic a similar number last year: He said undocumented immigrants paid $13 billion into Social Security in 2010, and only received about $1 billion in benefits.    Belén Sisa’s now-famous Facebook post on undocumented immigrants and taxes is right on the money. Her story also dispels the myth that undocumented immigrants don’t pay taxes in this nation.Also, they pay far more into taxes than they will ever receive from it.   " False link

There is an expression that goes, ‘If you’ve met one person with Autism, you’ve met one person with Autism,’” “Sesame Street” writer Christine Ferraro told “60 Minutes” reporter Lesley Stahl on. If the character of Julia does her job, Ferraro added, “when [children] encounter [people with disabilities] in their real life it’s familiar. And they see that these — these can be their friends too.” A survey released by the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore and Johns Hopkins University in 2012 found that 63 percent of children with autism spectrum disorders had been bullied. They were three times more likely to experience bullying than their non-autistic peers.” Read the full piece here ❤     ❤   ❤   ❤   The Trump budget pulls money from PBS, the makers of Sesame Street.  Please follow them and support if you can! https://twitter.com/PBS/status/841295289377943552  For real, people don’t understand how important this is because little kids who are autistic are going to feel validated and important because of her " False link

Teeth already have the capability of regenerating dentine if the pulp inside the tooth becomes exposed through a trauma or infection, but can only naturally make a very thin layer, and not enough to fill the deep cavities caused by tooth decay.  But Tideglusib switches off an enzyme called GSK-3 which prevents dentine from carrying on forming.  Scientists showed it is possible to soak a small biodegradable sponge with the drug and insert it into a cavity, where it triggers the growth of dentine and repairs the damage within six weeks.  The tiny sponges are made out of collagen so they melt away over time, leaving only the repaired tooth.  That is by far the coolest thing I’ve heard this year.  WHAT.  Me and my 11 cavities are paying attention.  please god let this become a thing quickly  @thebibliosphere  I require this to be a thing immediately so I don’t lose any more teeth. fuckin sign me up to be experimented on.

White nationalists commit more terror attacks than any other group.  Literally, CSIS (Canada’s spy agency) says white supremacy is a worse threat than ‘radical islam’: CSIS highlights white supremacist threat ahead of radical Islam  If you guys want to pretend you know everything about someone based on their name alone why didn’t you mention the name of the other shooter? Does it have anything to do with the fact that his name is Mohammad? Don’t pretend you care about what is and isn’t offensive and hurtful if you’re just going to turn around and call everyone a Nazi or a white supremecist. All you’re doing is race baiting further.  There was no other shooter. The other person (Mohamed Belkhadir), was mistakenly thought to be a shooter, he wasn’t. In fact he was a witness to the attack and gave first aid to victims of the shooting. The police thought he was a shooter, because he was seen leaving the mosque at the time they arrived. Alex Bissonette was the only shooter. Get your islamophobia out of here. " False link

Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.  Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of “need.” The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.  Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial, ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.  Supremacy of the Military Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.  Rampant Sexism The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Opposition to abortion is high, as is homophobia and anti-gay legislation and national policy.  Controlled Mass Media Sometimes the media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.  Obsession with National Security Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.  Religion and Government are Intertwined Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government’s policies or actions.  Corporate Power is Protected The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.  Labor Power is Suppressed Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed.  Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments often refuse to fund the arts.  Obsession with Crime and Punishment Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.  Rampant Cronyism and Corruption Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.  Fraudulent Elections Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.  Do a mental survey here. " False link
