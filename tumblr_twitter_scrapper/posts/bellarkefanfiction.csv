So I’m just going to post it here. Thank you so much for the prompt! Enjoy! “Guys, come on! The pins are for holding the skin down, not stabbing the frog’s eyes!” Clarke groaned, weaving her way through tables surrounded by short, wild eyed kids in order to reach a pair in the back. Jasper and Monty always had a habit of getting a little too into the dissections, and ordinarily Clarke wouldn’t be bothered by it. But when frog juice starts flying everywhere, she knows it’s time to intervene. By the time she’s wrestled the scalpel away from Jasper’s twitchy fingers and rushed a pale boy with clammy hands to the nurse, the lunch bell had already rung, and her kids were throwing their messy gloves at each other and laughing.  Clarke sighed, shaking her head and making her way back to her desk at the front of the room. “Don’t forget to clean up before you leave!” Clarke called, tossing her white coat onto her desk as she collapsed into her seat. Chairs were pushed in half-hazardly as the kids rushed out, some describing in horrifying detail what exactly they had done to their frogs as they left. Sighing, Clarke rubbed at her temples. Kids were something else. Unraveling her hair from her bun, she pushed herself off the desk and clambered out of her chair, following the elusive smell of coffee into the teacher’s lounge. There she made an immediate beeline for the coffee pot, brushing past Raven with no more than a quick hello. She’d ask about that big project the physics teacher was working on for her kids later. Right now, coffee was essential. Except when Clarke had finally wrapped her handle around the pot, there was quite literally nothing left, save for a thin rim of residual coffee grounds. Biting back a frustrated scream, Clarke shuffled the pot around in her hand, watching in anger as the last few dredges of coffee swirled at the bottom. The jerk who’d taken the last of the coffee didn’t even have the decency to start a new batch. “Something wrong, Princess?” Oh god. Clarke squeezed her eyes shut, pursing her lips and counting to ten before slowly turning to face the one and only Bellamy Blake. Read More" False text

Mum used to make the best lemonades with sunshine.” A little romantic ficlet in preparation for the emotional wringing we’re sure to face in tonight’s episode. Basically Bellamy being a muggle (and Clarke falling for him anyway) is what I live and breath for :D -/-  Clarke never asked for any of this. She needs to remember that. She never asked to be a pureblood, never asked to go to Hogwarts, or get bitten by a werewolf. She never asked for her dad to be killed, for her house to be burned down, or for her mother to go missing.  She certainly never asked to spend the summer in Octavia’s very muggle street, in her very muggle house, sharing the same space as her gorgeous but very muggle brother who Clarke’s been half in love with ever since she first saw them at Kings Cross.  Clarke’s putting everything at risk by just being here. She’s putting him at risk. “Home sweet home,” Bellamy Blake sounds friendly enough, but Clarke doesn’t miss the flash in his eyes as he glances at her.  Or the spike in his heartbeat, the salty-tang of fear in his scent.  He’s terrified of her.  Or, more likely considering what she already knows of him, terrified on behalf of his sister because Clarke is pretty much her only friend. And Clarke’s a feral werewolf on the run from The Ministry for killing a man.  If the shoe had been on the other foot Clarke doesn’t think she’d even let him into her house. “The house only has two bedrooms so you get Octavia’s for now. We’ll revisit the living situation when she returns from Romania.” Clarke nods faintly, adjusting the bag in her hand and Bellamy looks really annoyed for a second before he grabs it from her. “I’m a nurse,” he tells her as she follows him to the door. He unlocks it with a shiny silver key but instead of going in first he hangs back and gestures her ahead. “I probably can’t fix 90 per cent of wizarding injuries but I’m pretty damn good at the remaining 10 percent. So let me know immediately if you need any medical help, yeah?” Clarke nods then winces at the sight of the floral wallpaper in the corridor. It’s a horrific shade of purple with red flowers. “In addition to being a nurse I’m also incredibly colour blind,” Bellamy’s ears redden at Clarke’s reaction and her cheeks blaze at it being noticed. “I normally wait for Octavia for this kind of stuff but we had a row before she left and I thought I could do it myself.” “You were wrong.” “Obviously.”  He hesitates when she doesn’t step back as he comes inside. The corridor is small and narrow and there really isn’t enough space for them both. “Clarke?” He asks hesitantly as if she’s a wild animal and she supposes she is. “I just wanted to say thanks.” She fidgets as she deliberates whether to kiss his cheek or not, but then decides she wouldn’t be able to take it if he flinched. “You didn’t have to take me in.” “Yeah I did. You’re Octavia’s best friend. I don’t know what that means wherever you’re from, but around here that makes you family.” Clarke doesn’t really smile much any more, but the vehemence behind his words makes her want to. She supposes that’s progress. -/- “So,” Bellamy tells her after he carries her bag into Octavia’s room. “I’m going to go get started on dinner. Is there anything in particular that you’d like to eat?” It’s been years since she’s eaten proper home cooked food, and there are too many things to choose from (too many things she misses). Her dad was a muggle too and he was the best cook. He always said he used a different type of magic in the kitchen and the comment made her mum smile every time.  The day after his death Clarke became a werewolf  and went on the run, and she’s been living off whatever creatures she could find in the forest ever since.  A proper home-cooked meal would be perfect. “Anything,” she tries to smile but thinks it comes off as a grimace instead. “I’m not a picky eater.” Bellamy makes lasagna. It’s easily the best one she’s ever eaten. She takes three helpings and has just started on the fourth when she notices Bellamy’s amused expression. “What?”  “Nothing.” “You’re laughing at me.” “No I’m not.” His smirk widens. “I just haven’t had that reaction to my lasagna before. I should have you around more often, it’s a real ego boost.” Clarke blushes but doesn’t say anything. She does slow down though, and picks up her so far unused knife. It might not look like it at that moment, but Abbey Griffin didn’t actually raise a wild animal. -/- Bellamy works nights, which makes sense really. Octavia adores her brother and wouldn’t risk him intentionally. So over the next few months Clarke locks herself in the garage during her change. With her mum missing she makes her own wolfsbane, it’s the one potion she’s able to make without messing up which is ironic considering how advanced it is.  “What is that?” She hears Bellamy’s breath hitch as she uncaps the vial full of the last ingredient. He’s taken to watching whenever she brews the wolfsbane, initially because he didn’t trust her, but lately because he’s actually interested. But he has never had time to see the entirety of it before.  “Moonlight.” “You can stopper moonlight?” his voice sounds full of wonder like a child’s and Clarke can’t help her grin. “You can stopper anything. Mum used to make the best lemonades with sunshine.” The potion is finally complete with a strand of her hair and then in a fit of whimsy she stoppers a bit of starlight into a vial and offers it to him.  “What’s that?” He asks as he stares at the white nebula inside it. “Starlight,” She presses the vial into the palm of his hand. In the olden days witches would give starlight to the men they loved to protect them. She figures if he’s stuck with her anyway he might as well get something out of it.  “Thanks,” The smile he gives Clarke is breathtaking but she doesn’t really have much time to enjoy it because he chooses that moment to kiss her. His lips are dry, chapped, but Clarke has never been kissed so perfectly before. She winds her arms around his neck immediately to deepen the kiss, arches her body up desperately against his to get closer, and then growls when he pulls her leg up high over his hip. “Nobody’s ever done magic for me before,” Bellamy admits to her under the covers of his bed, his eyes half-closed. Clarke cups his face gently in her hands. She knows a little about the Blake siblings’ childhoods from Octavia. She knows their mom was a witch but that she was never around for either of them, knows that Bellamy risked his life by letting Octavia practice her magic on him, knows he sacrificed his hopes and dreams to raise his sister even when he didn’t have the first clue how to manage her magic.   Clarke knows that when Octavia is really, really sick, and calls out for her dad she really means Bellamy. “I’m not that good,” She kisses his brow. “I’d show you everything if I could.” “You’re good enough for me.” Strangely enough, for the first time in her life, Clarke believes it. -/- " False text

(“I don’t understand why you’re also blaming me ,” mutters Miller mulishly, “ She’s the one who made the bet with him. I had nothing to do with their bullshit ideas.” “You spurred them on,” says Clarke, and he rolls his eyes, but doesn’t deny it.) It starts when Miller returns from vacationing with his dad up in the mountains sporting a full beard. His beard isn’t really anything new to them- normally he just errs on the side of scruffy, but has been known to grow it out once in a while, especially back when they were in college- so there’s just the general ribbing and maybe one or two pointed comments dropped by Monty before they ignore it. And then Bellamy gets drunk. Bellamy doesn’t usually get drunk when they go out; in fact he’s usually the one still annoyingly sober while they do stupid shit like climbing up on the tables or trying to rewire the jukebox. But it is the start of summer break and all his AP students passed their exams so if there was an occasion for overdoing the celebratory drinking, this would be it. Drunken Bellamy is even sort of cute, far more tactile and vocal about his affection. Which is why it’s no surprise that as the night wears on, they find him gently stroking Miller’s cheek murmuring all sorts of nonsense while Miller looks three seconds away from throttling him. Clarke sneaks a picture. She’s totally going to use this in a mood board when his birthday comes around. “I’m so jealous of your beard,” he slurs, just a little, and Miller slaps his fingers away. “I’ve always wanted a beard.” “I don’t know if you’ve realised this,” says Raven, dropping in from seemingly out of nowhere, “But you’ve got all the components you need to grow a beard, Blake.” Miller snorts at the exact same moment Bellamy’s face falls. “Yeah, no. Theoretically he might have them but trust me on this. Blake is as bare faced as they come.” Raven’s eyes practically light up at that and her head snaps back to look at him. “You can’t grow a beard?” she asks delightedly. “Of course I can grow a beard,” he grumbles. “Then how come we’ve never seen you with one?” “Because it’s uncomfortable .” “Uh huh, sure. That’s why.” She lifts an eyebrow. “I bet you can’t grow a full beard like Miller’s before the month’s up.” “Easiest fucking bet you’ve ever made, Reyes,” says Miller, and Bellamy elbows him in the ribs. “I can totally grow a beard in the next three weeks,” he protests. “I don’t need to prove that to you.” “Methinks the man doth protests too much,” she says in a sing-song voice, and his scowl deepens. “I’m not protesting. And that’s not the quote.” “Come on,” she wheedles, “Fifty bucks says you can’t.” He glowers at her for one last moment before finally caving. “Fine,” he sighs, sticking his hand out for her to shake. She does so rather enthusiastically and Clarke already knows that this is going to be a disaster. “I’ll take your stupid bet.” Keep reading " False text

And when she stops and scoots her chair away from the table, she finally breathes again. And she can’t look away.“Who is that?”Clarke finally turns her head to find Raven leaning over her shoulder, studying her drawing. She was so lost in it that she never even heard Raven come down the hallway. “I don’t know,” she admits. Raven just hums and starts up a pot of coffee.She and Raven have been friends for two years. They ended up living together when they realized Raven’s live-in boyfriend was also dating Clarke. It wasn’t an easy transition from jilted ex-lovers to friends, but they’ve reached the point where they’re friends first and Finn is just a distant memory.However, Clarke hasn’t told Raven, or anyone—except for Wells—about her drawings. And she only told him because he caught her drawing the face when she first started, when they were just little kids.“I’ve been drawing this same face since I was, like, four,” she explains and Raven turns slowly, like she’s starting to understand what’s going on. “This is the best I’ve ever done. He looks… real.”“What do you think it means?” Raven asks her carefully and Clarke is having a hard time reading her tone.The two of them have never talked about soulmates. She always just assumed it was because Raven didn’t have one. Or that Raven assumed the same about her. Neither of them have any visual soul marks on their bodies, so it’s an easy assumption to make. And because soulmates aren’t guaranteed—or even completely understood—Clarke doesn’t share what she believes is her soulmate connection with anyone.“I think it could mean a lot,” she finally says and they both laugh because the thought seems so unbelievable. Soulmates. Raven slides into the seat across the table from her and touches the top of Clarke’s sketchbook. Clarke pushes it toward her just enough to let her know she can look through it.The book isn’t just that same face over and over. There are some other sketches thrown in there, too. But she’s been so busy with school and work that hasn’t had much time for her own art and the book is full of sketches she’s done over the past two years. The face takes up more than half of the filled pages, though.Raven starts at the beginning and stops to inspect each iteration of Clarke’s could-be soulmate. She ignores the beeping of the coffee machine, so Clarke gets up and pours them both a cup while Raven keeps flipping through the pages. When Clarke sits back down, Raven is looking at the face Clarke drew three months ago. The differences between that and the one she finished are even starker than Clarke originally thought.“Wow,” Raven says, pushing the book across the table and trading it for her coffee cup. “He’s hot.”“He is, right?”“Really hot,” Raven promises and Clarke smiles into her coffee cup as she takes a sip. “I hope you get to meet him.”“I never thought I would,” she says quietly and Raven nods, almost like she understands. “Do you have one? We’ve never talked about it and I know it’s rude to ask, but—““Nope,” Raven answers, cutting off Clarke’s rambling. “Neither did Finn, so I kind of always thought he was mine. Like we were two leftover people that weren’t bound by fate to anyone else. I thought we got to choose who we loved. I thought we chose each other.”Clarke feels guilty every single time the subject of Finn comes up, but never more than this moment. She slept with and fell in love with the one person Raven chose to love. The only one she’s ever chosen. “I’m sorry,” she says for the thousandth time and she means it. She always means it.“It’s not your fault. You didn’t know. And it clearly wasn’t meant to be. We were young and I was naïve. You didn’t do anything wrong. You just fell in love.”Clarke smiles tightly and nods, closing the book in front of her. “I’ve got to get to work.”“Did you even sleep?” Raven asks her and Clarke laughs until it turns into a yawn. “So, no?”“Not really, but if I don’t serve coffee, who will?”“Octavia? Monty? Literally anyone else you work with?” Raven asks, but Clarke just shrugs. She needs the money. She can sleep later. “Okay. But do you mind if I come with you? I can’t work here anymore. I get too distracted by the internet and TV.”“The café has wifi, you know,” Clarke reminds her, but Raven just narrows her eyes, waiting for an answer. “But of course you can.”–The café is quiet, like it always is, because it’s a Thursday in July in a pretty small college town, but Clarke keeps herself busy. She brought her sketchbook with her and starts another drawing of the same face. She’s never done two so close together, but something told her to bring the book and a pencil. And because she is desperate to know more about this face and what it could mean, she listens to that impulse.Raven is the only constant in the café, so it’s easy—and forgivable—for Clarke to get lost in this new drawing. She does have to stop every so often when she hears the bell above the door jingle, but not for longer than a drink and a pastry order. It’s an easy day, work wise, but Clarke’s mind is running nonstop.She’s able to put the pencil down when she’s got a rough outline of his face done because the door swings open with a flourish. “You’re not working today,” she accuses Octavia and she sighs dramatically. “What’s wrong?”“My brother is meeting me here.” She says it like she’s waiting for the devil himself to walk through the door.“I didn’t even know you had a brother,” Raven says pointedly. Clarke didn’t know either, but it’s not a surprise. She and Octavia aren’t all that close. They had a few classes together in school and work together, but that’s the extent of their relationship. Octavia’s not a sharer. There’s no reason either Clarke or Raven would have known she has a brother.“That’s because we’re not really close anymore. He always acted more like a dad than an older brother and I finally couldn’t take it anymore once high school came around,” Octavia admits. She almost looks regretful, but not quite. “This is the first summer since I started college that I’m not going home, so he asked if he could come visit for a long weekend.”“And you said yes.”“I kinda miss him,” she shrugs before sitting at a table alone, facing the door. “He’s meeting me here so he can see where I work.”While Raven rolls her eyes and goes back to her computer, Clarke leans over her sketchbook, but turns back the page to look at the drawing she finished this morning. She studies the face again and feels her smile growing ever so slightly. How can someone she doesn’t even know—who might not even exist—make her this happy? How does she know that she’d fall for him if ever given the chance to meet him?“This is crazy,” she says, mostly to herself, just as the door opens. “It doesn’t make any— holy shit.”Raven looks up at that and finds Clarke staring at whoever just walked through the door. Clarke can’t believe it.“Holy shit,” Raven echoes and Clarke finally looks away to make sure Raven is seeing exactly what she is. She definitely is. “Clarke…”“I know,” she says, but she can’t look back toward the door. Not even when Monty comes in whistling. Not even when Octavia’s brother is standing right in front of her, ignoring his sister almost completely. She just keeps her eyes trained on Raven. She knows Raven. Raven makes all the sense in the world. What’s waiting for her when she turns her head makes no sense.“Clarke.” Raven says it more forcefully now, eyeing the man standing at the counter. Clarke can hear Monty putting on his apron and she feels him trying to read the situation.“Can you say that again?” Octavia’s brother asks and Octavia lets out girlish laugh—unlike anything Clarke has ever heard come out of her.“Clarke!” Raven says it again, standing up to really make her point. And Clarke knows she’s right. She knows she should look at him. He asked her a question. Not one she completely understands, but still. She’s being rude.“Say what?” Clarke asks, finally looking at him again. Up close he’s even more handsome than when she saw him walk through the door. Way more beautiful than he appears her sketchbook.Her soulmate?“Say what you said when I walked inside,” he begs her. “Please.”“Okay,” Clarke says, but she’s not really sure why he wants to hear it. “I was going to say that it doesn’t make any sense, but then I, um, I saw you.”He doesn’t look pleased. In fact, he almost looks annoyed with her. But when his eyes fall to the notebook on the counter, he goes pale and reaches back for Octavia.“That’s you,” she says, reaching for the book almost on instinct, but Clarke closes it quickly and pulls it back against her chest. “You don’t know my brother, but that’s his face. It’s you.”“Monty, can you cover for me while I take a break?” Clarke asks. She can’t stand there, looking at that face while Octavia says monumental things like that while she’s wearing her stupid apron.“Yeah…”“Thanks.” Clarke takes off her apron and tosses it under the counter before walking around to the dining room. Raven is watching her closely, like she’s ready to pounce at any moment if needed. But the closer Clarke gets to this person, the more at ease she feels. Even if none of it makes sense.“You said, ‘It doesn’t make any— holy shit,’” he tells her and she nods. Then he starts unbuttoning his shirt, never taking his eyes off of her, and Clarke has even less of an idea of what’s happening.“Jeez, Bellamy, at least warn the girl,” Octavia says with a sigh and a shake of her head.Bellamy. Clarke likes the sound of that. She’d repeat it out loud just to see how it feels if he wasn’t taking his shirt off in the middle of a café.He only pulls one arm down once it’s unbuttoned and just enough for her to see something written on his bicep. A tattoo.A tattoo that says, “It doesn’t make any— holy shit.”“So, it is what I thought,” she says, reaching to trace the tattoo before she remembers that she doesn’t even know this person. Soulmate or not, she can’t just grope his arm.“Looks that way,” he says and when she looks back at his face, he’s smirking just slightly—like she’d drawn on his face that morning. His glasses are a little askew—like she’d drawn that morning—and it’s all very charming.“I’m really sorry you have to live with that stupid half sentence and compulsory curse word on your arm for the rest of your life,” she tells him because she really doesn’t know what else to say. And when he laughs, she smiles back at him like it’s the most natural thing in the world.“I’m Bellamy.” He holds his hand out for her to shake and when she grabs it, she swears there’s an electric current running through her whole body.“I’m Clarke.” She’s still holding his hand—no longer shaking it, just… holding it. But he doesn’t let go either.“I can’t believe this is happening,” Octavia says and for the first time in minutes, Clarke remembers there are other people watching them. “I can’t believe it’s Clarke.” That girlish giggle erupts from her again and Clarke realizes that she’s happy. Hell, she’s delighted.And Bellamy looks pretty delighted, too.–Eventually, Clarke had to get back to work and Octavia and Bellamy needed to leave to café. In the hours that have passed, she’s been finishing up the sketch she’d started just before she met him. Her soulmate.Monty and Raven couldn’t stop freaking out. They didn’t know of anyone else at school who’d found their soulmates. They definitely weren’t there to witness it. Clarke still wasn’t quite able to form a coherent sentence herself, so she let them go on and on until Raven eventually left. But, then she let Monty go on and on by himself.He has a soulmate and the mark to prove it, but he’s never met them. He knows nothing about them. Clarke was lucky in that way. This whole time she knew what he looked like. She’d basically watched him grow up in her sketchbooks.She didn’t learn much before he had to leave to meet Octavia’s boyfriend for lunch, but she now knew he was twenty-eight. He was finishing up his own degree to become a teacher. And he had a voice so deep she felt it almost more than she heard it.“So, are you going to meet up with Bellamy before he leaves?” Monty asks her as she’s getting ready to leave at the end of her shift.“You heard our entire conversation. You know as much as I do.”“Well, then, I can’t believe you didn’t make any plans.”She honestly can’t believe it either. She’s been waiting to meet him since she first started drawing his face, nineteen years ago. They should have made some kind of plan, even if it included Octavia and Lincoln. Anything would be better than the nothing they came up with.When she leaves the café, she’s tempted to just text Octavia and ask for Bellamy’s number, but when she turns the corner toward her apartment, she sees him walking toward her.“I was just about to text your sister,” she tells him and he smiles, almost shyly. “This is better.”“I don’t know how to do this,” he admits and she nods. She’s never met her soulmate before either. She has no idea how it works. “I don’t know how we’re supposed to live our lives now, knowing what we know. I never really planned to meet you. So many people live without their soulmates, you know? I always just figured I would be one of them.”“I’m glad you’re not,” she says and he smiles again before looking down at the ground. “I mean, I always knew you were hot, but it’s way better in real life.”“Yeah, I didn’t know what you looked like, but I always liked that you weren’t afraid to swear,” he says with a laugh. “And it doesn’t hurt at all that you ended up being hot either.”Clarke laughs and takes a small step closer to him. It’s almost like she can’t help it.  “Shouldn’t you be with your sister or something?”“She’s happy that I met you,” he admits. “She thinks it’ll get me off of her back, so I promise she doesn’t mind that I’m here.”“So, then will she mind if you come to my place and have dinner? Because I’m starving.”“Then we should go to your place,” he says and she leads him toward her apartment. After just a few steps, she feels his hand envelope hers and she squeezes it just to make sure it’s all really happening.And it is." True text

The world might not be perfect, but he is, and he’s convinced that she is, too, so it has to work.Basically super fluffy Bellarke morning sex. a/n: Someone on Tumblr (I’m so sorry that I can’t remember who! My brain is mush!) asked me for sleepy Bellarke, and I had to post this! [AO3] When Clarke wakes up, she smiles at the feeling of strong arms wrapping around her waist and pulling her against a firm chest that she seems to fit so perfectly against. She sighs contentedly, and Bellamy nuzzles against her shoulder, breathing in the scent of her and pressing a soft kiss to the side of her neck.“Good morning,” he mumbles sleepily, and if she could only ever hear one sound again for the rest of her life, it would be the sound of his voice, hoarse from sleep and disuse, quiet enough so that she’s knows he’s speaking only to her. “Morning,” she answers with a smile, running her foot up the inside of his calf.It’s been too long since she felt this happy, this comfortable. “Sleep well?” he asks, and she can feel his smile on her skin, one that matches hers, as he presses teasing, barely-there kisses to her shoulder. She mumbles an assent, unable to find her voice as he brushes her hair aside and his mouth finds that spot just below her ear that has her arching back into him, desperate for more. He groans against her skin, his teeth nipping at her, and his arm tightening around her waist as she grinds against his obvious arousal. “Fuck, Clarke,” he mumbles, so she rubs back on him again for good measure.One of his hands darts under her tank top and starts exploring the expanse of bare skin he finds there, while the others easily slips beneath the waist band of the black scrap of lace she wears, his finger dancing around where she wants him, where she needs him, but he never quite touches the point that will undo her. His mouth becomes hungrier against her neck as his fingers find one of her nipples. She turns her head, searching for his lips, and he meets her in a slow, easy kiss, his tongue swiping along the seam of her mouth, begging for entrance.She lets him in, and she bites his lip, taking it into her mouth when his thumb and index tweak the nipple he’d been playing with. The fingers of his other hand flex against her hip, urging her to turn around. She does, and lying on her side, chest to chest with him, he can deepen the kiss. His hand slides down her body, over the curve of her ass, where he can’t help but squeeze, pushing her harder against his growing erection. He continues exploring down the length of her, playing with the soft fabric of her tiny sleep shorts, and he hides a chuckle against her mouth, one she swallows as she cards her hands through his hair. They’re both so happy, but too stubborn to say the words out loud. When his fingers can wrap around the back of her thigh, he hikes her leg over his hip, leaving not a whisper of space between them, and they lie there, his hand brushing up and down along the divots of her spine, trading slow, messy kisses and stale morning breath, bathed in sunlight while Seattle comes to life just outside of his apartment window.When they eventually break apart, both lying on their sides, heads pillowed on their arms, Bellamy looks at Clarke with a smile on his face that could rival the sun shining outside. His hand radiates heat where it rests against the skin of her hip. There is  not a thing in the world that Clarke wouldn’t trade to wake up every morning in his arms, to feel like she finally belongs. “So,” she starts, her fingers tracing patterns up and down his arm. She presses a light kiss to his chest before continuing. “Last night was -” Read the rest on [AO3] " False text

Slowly, he dragged his eyes from the bullet hole to her face.  Her eyes were dark, cold pits, fear and sadness etched into the creases in her forehead.  “What are you doing?” he asked, his ears still ringing.  His vision tunneled as he stared at the gun. The gun in Clarke’s hand. The gun pointed at him. “What I have to.  Like always,” she replied.  The gun was trembling but her jaw was set.  Determined. Determined to shoot him. “Octavia’s out there,” he pleaded.  “She’s— she’s out there.  You can’t expect me to—” “– if you open that door, we die,” Clarke interrupted.  “All of us.  I can’t let that happen.” “You don’t know that.” “I do,” she said, her voice breaking.  Tears filled her eyes but didn’t fall.  “After what I did— they’ll kill us for it.  I have no choice.  This is…this is who I need to be.” The words landed like a body blow.  He’d said that to her once in a vain attempt at comfort and hearing them now sent ice down his spine.  But her hand was still shaking and a tear fell, so he took a step down and then another.  “Then do it,” he said, thankful his voice was steady.  His heart was cracking in two but he sounded sure; certain. “Bellamy,” she whispered. “You know I won’t leave her out there.  So do it,” he urged.  “This is who you need to be, right?  If you believe that, then do it.  Kill me.” “Bellamy, please,” she repeated. “You have no choice,” he spat.  He reached the floor but she didn’t lower the gun, just swallowed hard.  “And neither do I.  That’s my sister out there.  So if you’re going to shoot me, shoot me.”   He walked towards her and Clarke shook her head in despair.  “Don’t do this, please.  You know— you know I can’t.  I need you.” “Do you?”  His mind was clearing now, disbelief giving way to anger.  You need me?  You left me.  And now you might kill me. “I do,” she said, and it sounded like a sob.  He drew closer, the gun still between them.  “You know I do.  I— I made sure you were safe.  I couldn’t do this without you.”  She took a shuddering breath.  “I love you,” she said, and it felt like a slap. In another life those words might have brought him joy, but now they just pissed him off.  “Then choose,” he growled, and stepped right up to her.  The barrel of the gun pressed into his sternum; cold and hard and deadly.  “Do it, or let me save my sister.”   Clarke met his gaze and he saw his death flicker there.  He swallowed, not letting himself break, and wondered if she’d do it.  A tear tracked down her cheek, then another and then another.  And then the moment passed.  “They’ll kill us,” she protested, but Bellamy just wrapped his hand around hers and slowly tugged the gun away from his chest.  It clattered to the floor and they collapsed into one another, Clarke’s face mashing against his shoulder and his arms coming up to hold her.  The anger that had flared in his gut dimmed— not yet cold ash, but no longer threatening to consume him.  Clarke sobbed and he felt his own tears start to fall fall.  “I did what I had to,” she kept murmuring, and he smoothed her hair down and nodded. Because this world wasn’t fair and never would be. " False text

He was already half way up the last set of stairs before he turned to look at her.  “Clarke, I already told you. I’m not leaving her out–”  He stopped talking the moment she lifted her gun and pointed it at him, a sight that left him speechless for a moment.  “What are you doing?” He asked, a wave of shock traveling through him.  She was quiet for a second, and he noticed how much her hand was shaking.  “What I have to.” She said, trying to keep her tone even.  He took a small step downward and another until he was off the stairs completely. “You can’t really believe that.” Her entire body wavered, but she didn’t lower her arm, even when he began moving closer toward her.  “If you don’t let me open that door, my sister will die.”  “You don’t even know if she’s still alive.” Clarke replied, her expression solemn.  “Which is why I have to find out… and you have to let me.” He was pleading with her, searching her eyes for the person he knew her to be.  “I… I can’t.” She shook her head, on the verge of tears. “I’m not doing this for me. I’m doing this for everyone. Sometimes sacrifices have to be made.”  “Then why didn’t you leave me out there with the rest of them? How do you decide whose worthy of being saved and who’s not?”  He reached out to her, and placed his hand partially on the gun, his fingers reaching her wrist.  “This is not who you are.” He echoed her own words back to her, and together they lowered her weapon.  Her face was wet with tears, and he pulled her into him, his arms wrapping tightly around her as her cheek rested against his chest.  “I’m sorry… I’m so sorry…” She squeezed her eyes shut. “I don’t know what to do. I can’t– I can’t bear it anymore, Bellamy. I don’t have the strength to.”  “It’s okay.” He was quiet, his hand smoothing down her hair. “I’ll lend you some of mine.”  She looked up at him and he looked down at her.  “We’re in this together, remember? Let me bear it with you.”  She smiled. It was small and it was sad, but it was still a smile and that’s all he had needed.  After a few more seconds, they pulled apart.  “Let’s go get your sister.” She finally said, and now it was Bellamy’s turn to smile.  " False text

One minute they were discussing how they might be able to start building more permanent homes now that things were calm for the moment and the next they were screaming at each other. It wasn’t an unusual thing for the two to disagree or even to argue, but lately there had been so much tension between the two that they always seemed to end up screaming at one another. Their friends had learned that once things started heating up it was time for them to leave. The first time it had happened Monty had tried to play peacemaker between the two and they had ended up screaming at him instead. They’d both felt terrible afterwards and every time it happened, they promised that they would do better. And yet, here they were again. “I don’t have to like your ideas, Princess. It’s not a requirement that I agree with you all the time.” Clarke laughed. “You never seem to agree with me anymore. It’s like you decide your opinion solely based on the fact that it’s the opposite of mine.” “That’s bullshit.” Bellamy shook his head. “You’re the one that always seems to want to fight. What’s wrong? Now that there’s no war, no people to kill, you’re bored?” Clarke froze, not believing her ears. She shook her head, most of the anger draining from her and leaving behind a deep pit of hurt. She fought back the tears as she slammed her palm against Bellamy’s chest and pushed him back. “Fuck you, Bellamy!” She turned and started to head towards the door, just now noticing that their friends had once again left them. “Yeah, I wish you would.” His tone was yearning and the words were soft, so soft that she wasn’t sure if she had heard him correctly.

It’s a silly thought. Bellamy is also not the type of person who becomes a boyfriend in the first place. And she’s not the type, either, to form vague romantic fantasies—certainly not about assholes like him.  He’s probably the type who barely acknowledges the relationship. He’s probably the type who’s gruff in public, not demonstrative; who maybe, every now and then, will place a hand to her back just to let someone else know: hey, she’s taken, and that’s all. But then in private he’s harsh kisses and sex standing up, her back against the wall, her legs around his waist. Biting kisses instead of sweet kisses. And not a talker. Not a sweet talker, not much for words at all.  She’s so sure of all of this that when he does kiss her, and it is sweet, and gentle, and soft, she’s more taken aback by the careful way he lets his palm rest against her cheek than by the kiss itself. She doesn’t quite kiss back. But she doesn’t pull away. So for a long moment they just sit there side by side next to the dying fire, their knees touching, their lips touching, statue-still like they’re posing for a tableau.  Then Bellamy pulls away, and just stares at her, blinking slowly.  Keep reading " False text

When some of the grounder clans won’t stop attacking the people of the Ark, they turn to the commander for a truce. The solution? An arranged marriage between the young and promising leader Bellamy Blake, and the Trigedakru’s own warrior and member of Lexa’s inner circle, Clarke. It’s just a business arrangement. Right?Chapter 4 - start from the beginning  It was easier after that, less tense. The ice between them had been broken, and they were both glad of it. They talked a little more, and they didn’t stay so far on their own sides of the bed at night. It was too cold to bother with that most nights anyway. Things at Clarke’s village carried on as usual, and before they knew it, they’d been married for a month and were packing up for Arkadia. Octavia and Lincoln would be coming with them. “Why couldn’t you two be the marriage for the treaty?” Bellamy grumbled to them just before they left. Lincoln laughed softly. “Because I’m hardly a grounder, and Octavia’s hardly a sky person. They know better.”He was right–he and Octavia were often off on their own, since neither one of them felt completely comfortable at either place. Clarke arrived with their horses loaded up with their packs, one for each couple since her village wouldn’t spare more, and they set off. They reached Arkadia by sundown, and had barely gotten inside Bellamy’s cabin, now their cabin, when it was flooded by a steady stream of people checking in to update him on the happenings of camp. Miller was first, to brief him on security, but everyone from farmers to children came to tell him about their month. Some even thanked him for securing the treaty. He introduced them to Clarke, his mouth sticking on the word “wife” with a little difficulty. She smiled warmly at them all. [read it on ao3]  " False text

She lives closer to his station than he does, and sometimes he’s exhausted when he gets off his shifts at weird times, so he drives to Clarke’s place and passes out on her couch, which is admittedly very comfortable. She doesn’t mind. Bellamy’s her best friend, and she likes having him around. Plus, he sees a lot of shit, working for the LA Fire Department, and Clarke knows he needs to decompress after some of it, and he shouldn’t be alone with his thoughts. They watch Netflix or play video games or make food, and she’s happy to be the sunshine he needs after a hard shift. She gave him his own key after a while, so he can get in right away if she isn’t home at the moment, so she’s not surprised when she wakes up at two in the morning to the sounds of her front door shutting, the deadbolt sliding back into place, and heavy steps ambling around her kitchen. “Bell, is that you?” she calls.

(she doesn't’ even go here)  Here on AO3 “Don’t you dare look,” Octavia growled bringing Bellamy’s eyes back up to hers. Curiosity had gotten the better of him for a half second but he snapped out of it as she gripped his hand harder. He was at her side, his other arm was holding her leg up hooked under her knee and Clarke was at the end of the table. Her face concentrated. “One more push, Octavia, just give me one more,” Clarke said and Bellamy felt Octavia’s muscles tense. This wasn’t like when Octavia was born, even if years had dulled the memories, he knew this was different, better. “Now, Octavia, push,” Clarke said before she started counting. Lincoln should be here, but he was gone. Two weeks ago they’d gone out on a routine meeting. Clarke and Bellamy could have done it without him, but this clan had a particular dialect that neither of them had managed to get quite right and they were sticklers for protocol and tradition so he’d volunteered. It was going to be three hours. No big deal. Octavia wanted to come but she’d been having contractions and Abby refused to let her go. There was a storm and he’d fallen off the side of the trail, then a mudslide and he was gone. They’d been searching for the past two weeks but he was gone. Octavia was a mess. She was angry with everyone. Bellamy knew eventually the anger would be overcome by grief but so far she was still livid. Even in labor, when her water broke she cursed and tried to punch him every time he offered assistance in getting her to medical. Octavia screamed like a banshee when Abby tried to touch her, claiming if she’d not put her on bed rest, Octavia would have been able to save Lincoln. Clarke heard the gossip around camp that Octavia was in labor and came running just in time to see Octavia to throw a tray at Abby. “I got it, mom,” Clarke offered and now she was down there, covered in more blood than Bellamy saw when he brought down a deer. He choked back his concern and remembered that his mother did this and survived without a doctor, Octavia was fine and in good hands. Women were badass. “Good, good, good,” Clarke said and her tone and the sudden loosening of Octavia’s grip had Bellamy looking at Clarke for confirmation. “It’s a boy.” She lifted the baby up and placed the bloody mess of goo and tiny person on Octavia’s chest. Bellamy was in awe, Clarke was smiling, and Octavia started to sob. But it wasn’t happy tears. She looked away and Clarke yelled for Jackson. Keep reading " False text

For a short time in her last year of secondary school, the year before she started her internship, two years before her father was floated and she was put in the skybox, there was widespread unrest on the Ark. Every year she could remember there was unrest, but this particular year, hers and Wells’ lives were threatened specifically. So for several months they both were guarded around the clock. And because many of the guards were found to be sympathizers of the opposing party, well, of course, there were only about four guards that worked the details. One of them was Bellamy Blake and Clarke spent a ridiculous amount of time keeping her blush under control and telling Wells that he was imagining her fidgeting. It was a schoolgirl crush and Clarke knew she made a fool of herself on a few occasions. “Is the paperwork to your liking,” her mother prodded. Clarke looked up from the info pad and gave her a look. “Looks like your standard ‘how to stop a coup before we run out of air’ type agreement.” She wasn’t sure but she thought she saw Bellamy Blake bite his lip to stop a laugh from escaping. It was out of her periphery, she was having some nostalgic feelings from school, and she couldn’t spare him a glance, she had to stare down her mother, but well, maybe. “Clarke,” her mother scolded her like she wasn’t an adult with a dead husband, and a child, like she wasn’t about to be used again for her mother’s political gain. “Do you want to step outside?” “No, Chancellor,” Clarke said with an air of condescension. “The paperwork looks fine. But I hope you’re going to buy us some new sheets or a punch bowl for the trouble.” This time she was sure that Bellamy Blake snorted. His own representative, an older leader from factory station, sighed. “And you, Mr. Blake?” Clarke’s mother turned now to him. He shrugged. “I’d rather have new sheets. Punch bowls seem like an upper class thing and I can’t fathom when we’d ever use one. But I guess there will be parties now, huh? Do we have to have parties to show everything is happy and everyone is smiling?” “People know this isn’t a marriage of love, you aren’t expected to put on a show,” the leader from factory station cut in. “Sure, sure, but it looks better if we smile. I thought everyone from this side of the Ark was all about pomp and circumstance,” Bellamy replied looking pointedly at Clarke. Now she was irritated. It was always about the haves and the have-nots with people from any section below 5. “We’re running out of air, the secret is out and our children and our parents’ lives are in danger.” Jake Griffin’s calculations were off by 10 years and Clarke was angry about the injustice of it all over again. “My mother was floated already, as well as my wife, that’s why we’re sitting here right now. She was falsely convicted and you’re the only apology this sham of a government can come up with. ” “Could float you too, that would tidy up the problem nicely, but since you’re popular down there in Section 17, despite not wanting to take a bullet for my mother’s mistakes, I’m here. For everyone’s good. To get us all to the ground without a coup by Diana Sydney.” “Diana Sydney is who you should be floating,” Bellamy muttered under his breath. “There’s no hard evidence for that,” Abby said from the spot behind her desk. They could only guess that she framed Bellamy Blake’s first wife. “So this is the new plan. We make you look appealing, and you overtake her in the election for council member.” “And I don’t tell everyone that you floated a completely innocent woman for a crime she didn’t commit, right?” Something about Bellamy didn’t sound like a grieving man or even one that was angry with his wife’s killer. “That’s line six or seven in the papers, didn’t you read it?” Clarke couldn’t help herself from asking needing to try and solve the puzzle of his odd tone. He turned to her, face closed off. “I did, but I’m not an idiot, I’m going to continue to remind your mother of this every chance I get, just so we’re clear.” “She prefers to be called Chancellor,” Clarke said with a tilt of her head. “She got my father floated, I prefer you call her that.” Bellamy sucked in air baring his teeth as though he was in some sarcastic display of pain. “Heard the rumors but I didn’t think they were actually true.” He turned to the Chancellor who was barely concealing her annoyance at Clarke. “Enough,” she said lifting her hands to slam on the desk, but seeming to remember herself at the last moment, gently placing her hands on the desk instead. “You’re the only one who can beat Diana Sydney in an election for her spot on the council. Clarke is going to take Kane’s seat, and the two of you can remind people on this ship that things are equal, anyone can flourish, you’ll be an adequate distraction while we try to get everyone to the ground. Sign the papers and get out of my office.” “When are my new sheets going to be delivered?” Clarke spoke up knowing the wrath she was incurring. “Honey, our new sheets,” Bellamy said with a smirk.   “Right, sweetheart, our new sheets,” Clarke corrected, returning the smile.
