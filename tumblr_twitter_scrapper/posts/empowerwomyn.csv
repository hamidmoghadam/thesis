How do we handle those obstacles? We keep a toolbox handy. Not one full of hammers and drill bits - though that’s totally cool to have - but one full of tools to help us get through the day. Whether that’s in the form of media, coping strategies, role models, or beliefs. Here’s what’s in our toolbox this month:Podcasts:Rookie: Tavi Gevinson, creator of Rookie Mag, hosts with interview from famous folks (Winona Ryder and Lorde have both been guests so far!) with advice on life and growing up as a girl.Streaming:Dear White People (Netflix) - based on the movie, this Netflix series is absolutely incredible. Every episode will have you laughing while keeping you woke. DWP is here to tackle injustice, and is a great way to start a conversation about privilege. With ten half-hour long episodes, it’s totally binge-able.Books:milk and honey by Rupi Kaur - a gorgeous collection of poems and illustrations. She started on Instagram, and her voice has since become the voice of a generation.Music:Harry Styles - Sign of the Times (single): PSA, don’t discredit musicians just because they’re in a boyband.Head and the Heart - Stinson Beach Sessions (album): Get your fix of indie-folk goodness from the band’s latest album, which features previously unreleased demos of some of their best songs.Jamila Woods - HOLY (single): The singer, who has been featured in the likes of Macklemore’s White Privilege II, has released a gorgeous, soulful self-love anthem.Icons:Sally Yates: The former acting AG was fired by Trump for standing up against injustice. She recently testified in a Senate hearing regarding Trump’s ties to Russia, and was the definition of empowered. She graduated magna cum laude from the University of Georgia’s School of Law, and became the first woman to serve as a US Attorney in Georgia’s Nothern District when Obama appointed her in 2010. She’s not on social media, but be sure to follow her story in the news - she’s going places!Life Skills:Hospitality - as summer approaches, things are beginning and ending. But we’re not talking hospitality as in hotels and travel. Radical hospitality is the notion of extending invitations and welcome beyond the usual. Maybe that means taking the time to invite the new girl to hang out with your friend group this summer. Maybe it means opening up a spare room to someone who needs a place to stay. Maybe it’s as simple as helping someone feel a little less lonely. In times where it’s easy to exclude others, be the sort of person who welcomes them in. And allow others to do the same for you."

Comey  said that Abedin forwarded “hundreds of thousands ” of classified  emails to her husband, Anthony Weiner (yes that one). In reality, Abedin  only forwarded a few - likely less than 12. However, when asked about  this, Sean Spicer said he wasn’t familiar with the situation.Which begs the question - did Trump fire Comey because of this? Or is his motive more personal?What  we do know is that Trump fired Comey based on a recommendation from  Attorney General Jeff Sessions - yes, that Sessions who Coretta Scott  King once wrote a letter of warning about, the same letter Senator  Elizabeth Warren persisted in reading during that now iconic moment from  Sessions’ Senate hearings. FBI Directors  usually hold a 10 year term after being appointed - Comey, who was  appointed by President Obama, had served less than four years. Comey has  confirmed the Trump is under FBI investigation regarding his ties to  Russia during the campaign. If Comey intended to bring any charges  against Trump or any members of his campaign or administration, he’s no  longer in a place to do so. There is no  word yet on who will replace James Comey as the head of the Bureau. We  can only hope that it is someone with experience, who is committed to  justice, and who will continue to do the right thing. But considering  Trump’s track record, it seems unlikely that we’ll do better than the  infamous and controversial J Edgar Hoover - and at least he had experience." True text

A version of this bill failed a few weeks ago, and the GOP is giving it another go.Why should Congress vote no?For a number of reasons. First of all, it doesn’t provide enough for many Americans, especially those with preexisting conditions. The recent MacArthur Amendment to the bill allows states to opt out of regulations that protect patients with preexisting conditions, meaning they’re very likely going to lose coverage and have to pay ridiculous amounts of money to get the care they could die without. Also, it will raise the cost of insurance and health care by an unnecessary amount. It’s going to hurt middle-class and working-class folks the most.What’s a preexisting condition?In short, any medical condition that you had before your current health care plan went into effect. This includes, but is not limited to: asthma, diabetes, cancer, chronic pain, fibromyalgia, heart conditions, lung disease, cystic fibrosis, scoliosis, high blood pressure, and much much more. Some politicians say that these are the results of “unhealthy decisions” but many of them are genetic and/or uncontrollable! Nobody asks to develop them, and some don’t have cures. Did we mention that pregnancy is considered a preexisting condition?Oh, and sexual assault is a preexisting condition under this new health care bill. Yup, you read that right.How much will it cost to put in place?That’s the real kicker - Congress doesn’t know. Why? Because rather than waiting for the Congressional Budget Office to finish reviewing it and give them an estimate, the House GOP decided to force a vote in order to capitalize on momentum for the bill.Anything else I should know?Oh, yeah - by the way - Congress has exempted itself from the AHCA. Never trust a cook who won’t eat their own food. " True text

In doing so he claimed that “someone as despicable as Hitler didn’t even sink to using chemical weapons.” He also also claimed Hitler brought “them” (he didn’t refer to Jews, Romas, LGBT individuals, etc.) into “the Holocaust center.”Was this right?NO. Hitler did in fact use chemical weapons. First, let’s clear up the fact that there were no “Holocaust centers.” The term holocaust wasn’t used to refer to the mass genocide committed by Hitler against the Jewish people (and other groups) until the 1950′s, and wasn’t common until the 1970′s. Hitler had concentration camps such as Buchenwald, Janowska, and Warsaw; and extermination camps such as Auschwitz-Birkenau, and Belzac. Extermination camps utilized gas chambers in order to kill victims. Prisoners were often told that they were going to a bath or shower, as the chambers were designed to look like showers. They were locked inside, where rather than water, poisonous gas called Zyklon-B was released, which is made up of hydrogen cyanide. Those inside would die within about 30 minutes, and an a rather painful manner. A chemical weapon is defined here by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons as(a)  Toxic chemicals and their precursors, except where intended for  purposes not prohibited under this Convention, as long as the types and  quantities are consistent with such purposes; (b) Munitions and devices, specifically designed to  cause death or other harm through the toxic properties of those toxic  chemicals specified in subparagraph (a), which would be released as a  result of the employment of such munitions and devices; © Any equipment specifically designed for use  directly in connection with the employment of munitions and devices  specified in subparagraph (b).Zyklon-B certainly qualifies as a chemical weapon under this definition.Are people mad? Yes. The Anne Frank House released a statement calling for Spicer to be fired, and it seems the internet is in agreement.Did I miss anything else in that press briefing?Spicer said they released a “comprehensive tick-tock of when the President was informed” about Syria and how he made his decision to launch an airstrike. We’re assuming he meant timeline.Trump wants to take action against North Korea. This could mean an airstrike, or sanctions, or other “solutions.” He basically said Russia is a nice kid who fell in with the wrong crowd (Iran, North Korea, Syria according to Spicer) but didn’t admonish Russia or Putin.It’s unlikely they’ll change the ban because “a lot of these refugees in particular talk about the fact that they’re not looking to flee.”The administration believes they’re going to gain more support in their initiative to change healthcare, citing that they want to increase competition and consumer choice. That may be great for businesses, but not necessarily good for the American people.The administration is essentially looking to restart the “war on drugs” claiming that illegal immigrants are often drug cartel members and therefore dangerous criminals.  Spicer offered up “thoughts and prayers” for the victims of the San Bernadino shooting, but no word on gun control. As usual.And that’s what you missed on Glee Official Things Happening in Politics That Really Should Not Be Happening in Politics." True text

This was in response to a gas attack carried about by Assad that reportedly killed around 100 Syrians.Can he do that?According to the War Powers Resolution, a President must notify Congress 48 hours in advance and get Congressional approval before carrying out any act of war. Trump did not do either of these things. The only exception to the WPR is when the United States has been attacked and there is a dire need for defense. This was not the case.Let it be noted that although Trump failed to inform Congress of the attack, he did inform Russia beforehand. This is important, considering the ongoing FBI investigation into the Trump adminstration’s relations with Russia. See also: Trump’s ties to Russia; and Flynn’s request for immunity in exchange for information about Russian relations.What is the world saying?They’re not happy. The UN Security Council is meeting to discuss Trump’s actions, and some leaders have made statements condemning his actions. Russia isn’t too pleased either, which could spell danger for the US.What comes next?Call your reps and share your disapproval. Urge them to take action against Trump! Continue to resist, persist, and never desist. " True text

For the next 31 days we’re going to celebrate women’s accomplishments, honor women’s stories, and draw attention to struggles women are still facing, even in 2017. How we’re celebrating: This special Women’s History Month explore page will be frequently updated with the top WHM posts found on Tumblr, because the best stuff always comes from you. Answer Times will be held, and important topics will be explored over on Action (@action). We also made some highly relevant stickers for you to put on your photos and GIFs, available right now in the Tumblr app. Take a look: Why this matters: 👆 See that Planned Parenthood sticker? While we’ve got plenty to celebrate, we also have crucial fights to fight. Women around the world are currently facing the possible revocation of basic human rights and access to adequate health care. Here in the US, Planned Parenthood (@plannedparenthood) is set to lose all federal funding. 5 million people use PP’s services every single year. That includes access to sex education, birth control, prenatal care, STD testing, cervical cancer screenings, abortions, and so much more.  How to help: We ask that you join us in donating to this irreplaceable non-profit or help out any other way you can, if you have the means for either. If you don’t, maybe you know someone who does. Could you pass it along to them? Tumblr stands with Planned Parenthood. Tumblr stands with women everywhere, regardless of sexuality, race, religion, or gender identity. We’re in this together. Oh, and If you’re attending SXSW this year, we’d like to invite you to a couple things jointly held by Tumblr and Planned Parenthood. There will be a panel on activism and a rally featuring live performances by Sleigh Bells, Girlpool (@girlpoool), Hoops, and PVRIS (@thisispvris). Find the details here.  " False text

We are stronger than people like Trump give us credit for, and our fight is just getting started. This blog aims to highlight the real Leslie Knopes of the world, and to provide a platform for girls to understand and participate in the political abyss.
