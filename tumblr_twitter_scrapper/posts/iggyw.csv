The best way to be “positive” toward your body is to treat it well, not by repeating some “I am beautiful” mantra over and over. You don’t have to be pretty. You don’t have to see yourself as pretty. Others don’t have to see you as pretty. PRETTY IS NOT IMPORTANT. Pretty is not your worth. You exist for you, not for anyone else’s gaze. " False text

Let’s get to know this Dark Horse. So he’s 18, he was the first to qualify for GPF, won last season’s bronze and represents Kazakhstan.   Many of you might not even be aware of the existence of this country, so in brief: Kazakhstan is a post USSR country in the centre of Eurasia, right between Russia, China, Middle East and Europe continent. So, why would Kubo-sensei even include someone from there?  The answer is Kazakhstan’s real life figure skating hero - Denis Ten.  Denis Ten is:  the first skater to represent KZ in international championships   currently 23 years old   is from Kazakhstan but of a Korean origin Olympic bronze medalist, World silver and bronze medalist, 4 Continents gold medalist, Asia Winter Sports gold medalist cinnamon roll like you wouldn’t believe how sweet Otabek is definitely inspired by Denis, and therefore I will take his perspective to judge his background. The thing about sport athletes in Kazakhstan is that they’re ALWAYS self-made. Neither education system nor sports practice is well-developped here yet. Which is understandable since the country is still young (25 years of Independance, yay) and confused in many aspects. That’s not fine but we manage. That however does not change the fact that Kazakh sport education is a complete bullshit when compared to Europe, USA, Asia or Russia (with the exception of boxing and martial arts, probably).  Therefore if you are from KZ and want a world champion for a kid, these are the steps you need to take: 1. Sign them up for sports club early. No team sports, only individual. Team sports have no future here yet. 2. Once they start to show a talent, interest and/or competitive spirit send them to Russia. Russia has better coaches, facilities and programme. Russia is close, cheap and easy to travel to, and not emotionally stressing for the kid, since it’s the same environment there.  3. Once they come of an age to participate in a competition SEND THEM AS FAR AS YOUR BUDGET ALLOWS YOU. USA and Canada for figure skating. USA, Europe and Australia for swimming and tennis. Why? Because it’s one thing to train in your rivals’ adobe, all of them   young talented and ambitious, being coached by their coach, at the same time as them, and completely other thing to be enrolled in a kind of sports boarding school where the coach is from some France and other students are from all over the world, struggling to get better same as you. Goverment does not provide any stable scholarships for this, btw. It’s all up to parents to find, choose and pay for. If you happen to have a kind, well-educated and persistant coach in KZ, they might win you some bonuses in a harsh battle against bureaucracy, but it will not be enough to cover for all or even half of it.  LAST YEAR!!!! You hear me?? He was 17, and already a bronze medalist when he returned to his hometown!!  That means that all the time before he spent overseas. Can you imagine that?? A 13-16 year old Otabek in another hemisphere from his home. That’s like half an equator, one ocean and 11-14 timezones away.  a l l   b y   h i m s e l f struggling with language barrier (think he had time to perfect his English before? not likely), with harsh training and obligatory schoolwork - all on top of taking care of himself all by himself.   Can you imagine Otabek coming back on one of those days to an epmty room in a dorm and messages from his family. Calls might be very hard to time up with such time diference. His mom inquiring how he has been, if he eats properly and does his laundry in time, scheduling for skype calls, updating him on his relatives and friends, giving advice on treating colds and stomach ache, and all those other things that most of the boys his age get for granted.    My heart aches over thinking how lonely he must’ve felt.  And, he probably wouldn’t be able to tell them, if anything would not go well. Because there would be nothing they could do from over there, it would only cause them to worry more. Even more than they already would have been. So there was only one way for him: to suck it up, train hard, suceed and make them proud. He is not trying to prove himself to himself as Yuuri, nor does he need to prove himself over others like Yurio. He doesn’t want it for fame like JJ, he wants it for his family, his people and his country. That’s any Kazakh’s default mission in life - make your parents proud. Especially after he had returned home with a medal and proved himself to be capable of competing at the same level as Victor fucking Nikiforov and Christophe Jeacometti!!!!!! Him! A Kazakh boy of 17 years!! Kubo-sensei does not joke around when calling him a hero, because he is one! A hero and a history-maker, same as Phichit. We haven’t seen his coach or team yet, but I have a feeling that it would be the same situation as Denis’s. Meaning, he doesn’t have one.  Denis Ten often travels (or used to travel) to the competitions by himself. There is no staff assigned to help him out. He is used to do trivial things like filling paper forms, booking time for practice, booking hotels, turning in audio tracks for the performance, etc. There have been numerous times when they had either messed up the music at the start of his performance or even played the wrong hymn during the awards ceremony. In his interview, Denis admitted to being totally lost at what to do at those time. There’s also no one to defend/protect him when something comes up, since there’s no one from KZ who has a weight in figure skating world.  I have a distinctive feeling Otabek will be the same.   I mean, how the hell would he be comfortable enough to rent a bike and ride all over Bar-freaking-celona, with no fear to get lost/in trouble, if he wasn’t used to this kind of responsibilities? Again, he’s 18.  At the same time Yurio is like:    Therefore his friendship with Yurio is truly a blessing. They do have a lot in common, they’re practically from the same background: the lifestyle in KZ and Russia does not really differ. It’s the same culture, the same language (KZ is bilinguial: both Kazakh and Russian are widely spoken), a really similar mindset, educational system, environment, custom etc. They’re both outsiders in the current lineup, striving to make a name for themselves. It’s almost the same as 5 years ago in that camp when both Otabek and Yurio were new to the rink in Saint-Petersburg. That’s what Otabek referring to, I think, when he says Yurio had eyes of a soldier. In that environment they’d be both treated the same, you know. Otabek as a no one from nowhere  and Yurio as a  that guy from Moscow. Not even sure what’d have been worse.  Also there’s a post going around about bad realtion between Russians and Kazakhs, stressing that Kazakh is an inferior race to Russians - PLEASEPLEASEPLEASE DO NOT BELIEVE IT THAT IS NOT TRUE!!!!!!!  Our nations have always been close, we have a long and complicated history but the friendship between two countries and people is very strong.  There are some issues in terms of racism on both sides but it is very rare/obscure case and is usually triggered by something. Therefore I ask you to support Otabek Altin and his friendship with Yurochka!Please do adopt him! Please do dote on him! He really deserves and needs that!  and if you have some more feels to spare, please take a look at  Denis Ten too :3   Thank you for reading, with love from Kazakhstan  " False text

So, I don’t know if you’ve heard but the Wonder Woman film comes out June 2nd… And if you didn’t know that, there’s a reason for it. Warner Brothers aren’t spending money on promoting the Wonder Woman film. No tv promotions, billboards, nothing. A film about a strong, powerful, amazing woman superhero directed by Patty Jenkins who happens to be the first woman to direct a superhero film with a female protagonist and one of only a handful (a literal handful… you can count on one hand) to direct a superhero film at all. They are setting it up to fail so they can say “I told you so” and not only continue the blatant sexism in the film industry but blame it on Patty if the movie fails, setting female directors up (whom are already told they won’t get hired) so they can have an excuse to say “Oh well, we tried hiring a woman to direct a film and it didn’t work. Lets not do that again.” This film is bigger than just being a superhero movie… It has the ability to bust open the glass ceiling of Hollywood to tell them that yes, superhero movies about women do well and yes, women can not only direct blockbusters but they can do it well. Because I can guarantee you, Patty does it well. PLEASE spread this around and let Warner Brothers know we aren’t going to stand for this bullshit. GO SEE WONDER WOMAN JUNE 2nd!!!

Yurio, for most of his life off-ice, has been trying to emulate that type of ideal through his personality and fashion. Additionally, Otabek is ridiculously masculine and strong. His facial structure, body shape, and voice is also very bold and sexy.  CHECK THOSE FUCKING PECTORALS Physically, he is a contrast of Yurio, but also acts as Yurio’s ideal.

Otabek has always been impressed by grace. Yurio has both of those qualities (that he probably doesn’t even notice). Otabek’s most prominent memory of Yurio was when he was in the graceful, resembling a first arabesque, position at the ballet barre.  Graceful beauty and flexibility was and is something foreign and difficult for Otabek to express. In turn, Otabek admires these qualities in others. And who, other than Yurio himself, fully embodies such ideals, to the extent that he does, in YOI?   TDLR: Yurio and Otabek are each other’s physical ideals and complete the physical aesthetics that both want but don’t have.

Once ship names become trademarked, fans risk losing a key means of creative expression, as well as a key intellectual property protection.  Trademarks are not copyrights.  There is no such thing as “fair use” protection when it comes to a trademark.  Trademarks are meant to generate $$$ for the trademark holder.  If you want to use a trademark, you need to obtain a license from the trademark holder. Fan writers, fan artists, or fan vidders who use trademarks in their work without permission/licence not only can be ordered to take their works down under DMCA, but also can be sued if the trademark infringement impedes the work’s ability to generate $$$.  Which means, fan creators who create explicit and/or controversial works – which is pretty much why fandom exists – could be seriously impacted.  Even if fan creators don’t use the trademarked name specifically (i.e. calls the pairing “Betty/Jughead” or “Betty x Jughead”), they can be nailed under trademark confusion – because “Betty/Jughead” is effectively “Bughead.” This is HORRIBLE news for fandom.  What does the Organization for Transformative Works think about the trademarking of ship names?

Horses could choose between a “no change” symbol or symbols for “blanket on” or “blanket off.” Previously, their owners made this decision for them. Horses are adept at learning and following signals people give them, and it took these equines an average of 10 days to learn to approach and touch the board and to understand the meaning of the symbols. All 23 horses learned the entire task within 14 days. They were then tested in various weather conditions to see whether they could use the board to tell their trainers about their blanket preferences. The scientists report online in Applied Animal Behaviour Science that the horses did not touch the symbols randomly, but made their choices based on the weather. If it was wet, cold, and windy, they touched the “blanket on” icon; horses that were already wearing a blanket nosed the “no change” image. But when the weather was sunny, the animals touched the “blanket off” symbol; those that weren’t blanketed pressed the “no change” icon. The study’s strong results show that the horses understood the consequences of their choices, say the scientists, who hope that other researchers will use their method to ask horses more questions.    i love everything about this but especially the last sentence " False link

iggyw 152347951560 "2016-10-26 20:00:38 GMT" https://iggyw.tumblr.com/post/152347951560/here-are-4-ways-trump-supporters-might-harass-you "meret118:  Last week, the Boston Globe interviewed  a Trump supporter who admitted that he’ll be going to polling places  looking for “Mexicans. People who can’t speak American” so that he can  “go right up behind them” and “make them a little bit nervous.” If you  don’t already know, that’s illegal, but it hasn’t stopped Trump from  encouraging his supporters to do it.  “Make sure everything is on the up. Make sure everything is on the up  and up,” Trump said twice, in case his supporters didn’t hear. “You’ve  been reading the same stories as I’ve been reading, so go to your place  and vote. And then go pick some other place and go sit there with your  friends and make sure it’s on the up and up. Because you know what,  that’s a big, big problem in this country and nobody wants to talk about  it. So go and watch these polling places.” As if voters don’t already have to contend with nonsense like, Voter ID requirements, reduced number of polling places in strategic locations and false claims about voter fraud, now we have to deal with this.  To help you out as you head to the polls, here’s a small list of things that could happen and what you should do.  ACLU Voter Protection Hotline: 877-523-2792 or 1-866-OUR-VOTE or Tweet to @866OurVote  1. You could be challenged to show photo ID: If you’re headed to vote and a Trumpster or polling officer finds you  suspicious, they could demand that you show a photo ID to prove you are  who you say you are. You might think it’s impossible, but it happened  to Native American voters in South Dakota in 2004 and it has been  happening to African-Americans since they finally achieved the right to  vote. Don’t freak out. According to Oklahoma ACLU Executive Director Ryan  Kiesel, these “artificial and onerous impediments to exercising your  voice in the democratic process vary wildly from state to state.” As a  result, you will have to check online here  to see if you have to have a state-issued photo ID to vote. However,  Kiesel was quick to point out that in Oklahoma, poll workers will  wrongly tell people that they can’t cast a ballot without their ID.  That’s not true. In most states, a person can cast a provisional ballot  if they don’t have the proper form of voter ID.  “There’s no one-size-fits-all rule when it comes to what kind of  voter ID laws are going to be in place for this election cycle,” Kiesel  explains. So, it’s best to look it up online or simply Google “voter ID  laws” and a helpful Google box pops up to give you some information.  2. A dude with a gun on his hip gets too close to you or photographs you. So, you’re excited to vote. You’re wearing your hot pink Planned  Parenthood t-shirt, you’ve left your Hillary Clinton button in the car  (because there is no electioneering in a polling place) and you step  into the line. Spotting your left-leaning tendencies, a big burly bro  sitting in a folding chair spots you and walks up. You notice he has a  gun on his hip. He stands close enough to you that you can smell his  breakfast. Or even if there is someone there photographing you or  filming you as you stand in line. The tactic is a commonly used tool  from the anti-choice movement to bully and dox pro-choice advocates. Keep calm. “Any voter who feels like their right to vote is being  impeded by another person should know that they have the right to cast a  ballot,” Kiesel said. “If it’s a government official standing in your  way then I suggest trying to go over their heads.”  Just because it’s a polling place doesn’t mean that all bets are off  or suddenly no laws apply. If anyone is following you around, whether  he’s at a shopping mall or a polling place, you can report it.  “People certainly have the right to exercise their speech with some  restrictions around polling places, but that doesn’t mean you can follow  someone around with the intent to intimidate someone,” Kiesel says. “If you’re experiencing that activity, you’re probably not the only  person who is feeling intimidated,” Kiesel continues. “You can do  everyone a service by reporting that to the poll workers, local law  enforcement, but also include local organizations like the ACLU in the  groups you’re reaching out to.” So, if this is a worker at the polling place, contact your county  election board. If your county election board is giving you flack, go to  the state. If all else fails and you feel like something is wrong, call  the hotline above or contact the ACLU at 877-523-2792 or other voter  protection hotlines at 1-866-OUR-VOTE. 3. If you’re told the polls are closing and it’s too late. Let’s say you’ve been at work or in class all day. You’re exhausted  and your triple-shot espresso wore off well before sunset. You pull into  your polling place well before it closes and because of polling  location reductions, you step into a line that winds through the parking  lot. You’re tired but you’re in it for the long haul because it’s your  patriotic duty. Then a nice lady with a clipboard comes up to tell you  that you won’t be able to be inside the building to vote by the time  polls close. She says you should just go home.  First, never listen to anyone with a clipboard. Sure, she may seem  nice and official, but any person that is in line by the time clock  strikes closing time is allowed to vote. It might be hard to stand up to  such a seemingly nice person, but make sure everyone knows that if  you’re in line, you’re good to go.  At Kenyon College in 2004, some students waited in line for over 11  hours, even after the media called the election, just to make sure they  cast a ballot. Never give up and never trust someone who’s trying to  stop you from voting. 4. Telling you the polling place has moved, the election is over, or on another day, really anything. People will say and do anything to keep their opposition from voting.  Fliers sometimes pop up in neighborhoods with high concentration of  Democratic donors that give misleading information or are downright  false. The day of the election could be moved, the polling place, really  anything.  As with the sketchy woman with the clipboard, don’t believe anything  you hear. Your best bet is to google it or call a polling official. If  you can’t google it, call or tweet the Voter Protection Hotline:  1-866-OUR-VOTE or @866OurVote. They’ll help you figure out what’s going on and make sure you have the proper information.  In the end, that’s the real solution for anything that could happen  to you at the polls. It’s like the old X-Files saying, “trust no one.”  Verify whatever anyone tells you, don’t allow anyone to intimidate you  or someone else and call the hotline if someone tries to claim you don’t  get to vote.  “One of the most important things not to do is to just walk away,”  Kiesel says. “Don’t think that a poll worker is correct in telling you  that you can’t vote, or be intimidated at your polling place and to  allow their activity to keep you from casting a ballot. The most  important thing to do is fight for your right to cast that ballot on  Election Day.” We shouldn’t have to fight for our right to vote anymore, but welcome to 2016 in America. Keep calm and vote on.  " False link

And if a ship ultimately becomes canon, so much the better. But when shipping becomes an ideology, tantamount to a religion, it makes a story’s creators pretty much tantamount to gods. In essence, even though that level of shipping may grow out of a wish to maintain parity with creators, it’s ultimately de-empowering to fans, making them dependent on creators for validation. But fans are validated through their love for the source material; they’ve never needed more than that. Turning that source material into a game to be won only turns all involved players into winners and losers. And when that happens, sooner or later, we all lose.  This is essential and required reading for all of fandom.  The article is spot on about a lot of things. The bit I quoted above was what struck home the most for me, but it also points out, very incisively, that how fans approach a work – with their point of interest or even entry point being centred around a ship or specific characters – is often very different from how creators approach it, and thus when fans ask creators questions that relate to shipping, creators often have no clue what the context or background is, how much thought they’ve put into the characters/ship, and conversely, fans have no idea how much the creators have put into the canonical story behind the scenes and what’s going on in production, with a huge team of scriptwriters, editors, artists, directors, publicists etc., rather than one Overlord Hivemind who determines “X ship shall be canon!” as fandom seems to think it is. This leads to an imbalance in perspective and expectation that often results in creator remarks getting taken out of context, misread, misinterpreted, or read too much into, and I think this relates strongly to what the quote above says about fostering a dependency on creators for validation, when that’s never been what fandom is about. Fandom exists in the spaces in between, the speculations, theories, and what-ifs, and most of all, a shared love for the source material. " False link

The only way they can beat it in my opinion, and I mean this 100 percent, if in certain sections of the state they cheat.” Trump has repeatedly claimed the election is “rigged” against him, laying some of the blame on the media. Trump is trailing Clinton by more than 9 points in Pennsylvania polls, one of several key battleground states in which he has slumped recently.  h/t: Tyler Pager at Politico  Okay, dashboard, this is not a “reblog me or be shamed” post, but I would really like you to please pay attention to this for a moment, because this is the only, singular post about this I’ve seen and I had to hunt it down in the tags myself on mobile- Donald Trump has just called for his voters to harass people going into the polls. No, seriously, look at his exact words here - “We’re going to watch Pennsylvania. Go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don’t come in and vote five times.” Did you know that Pennsylvania is an ex-voter ID state? The same voter ID laws Trump alludes to here? Did you know that approximately 9% of the PA electorate was estimated to be disenfranchised by those laws? Did you know that Hillary is heading Trump in PA by about 10%? Did you know that during voter ID law times, many states had an issue with ‘concerned citizens’ like True the Vote harassing people outside the polls demanding to see their IDs? Because that’s exactly what Trump is talking about here.  Voter fraud is vanishingly rare. It is virtually statistically impossible for it to affect the outcome of an election without being caught - thousands of cases would have to occur for even close elections, let alone ones where Trump is trailing by 10 points. This is not some legitimate concern - it’s a thinly veiled excuse to harass voters in ‘some areas’ - e.g., areas that are more likely to vote Democrat - e.g., heavily Black and Latino areas. (Potentially college campuses as well, though that’s a bit dicier because a lot of campuses will have their own polling station with campus security who tend not to fuck around.) So guys, please be aware - no one can prevent you from entering a polling place. No one has the right to demand your ID, or any identifying information. The poll workers are exclusively inside. If you see anyone committing voter harassment like this, please call 1-866-OUR-VOTE.     So guys, please be aware - no one can prevent you from entering a polling place.
