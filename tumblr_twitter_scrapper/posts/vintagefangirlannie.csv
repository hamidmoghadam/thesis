He is the rich, golden beams through the trees that caress your cheeks, illuminate your eyes, and dance new colours across your skin. He is cool, gradual,and  calming.  Jimin? Jimin is the dawn over the ocean. Jimin is orange rays striking your toes along with the waves, beautiful, blinding gold beaming off the water. Jimin is drawing lines in the sand for pink and purple rays to pool in, to filter through your fingers. He is quietly warming, a sleepy kind of calm, and heart-warmingly peaceful.  Jin is the feeling of hardwood beneath your bare feet after just waking up on a warm summer morning. He is a soft blanket after a long, cold day. He is coming home to a home cooked meal after being away. He is sitting on a porch swing and listening to the music of nature. He feels like coming home.   Namjoon is dawn in the city. Sunlight bouncing off the buildings and the earth coming to life. He’s dinner at three am, just because you can. He is falling asleep to rain pattering on a tin roof. He is music being played on the sidewalk that you just have to stop and listen to. He feels like something new.   Yoongi. Yoongi is silence after a busy day. He is watching an old movie you had completely forgotten about, and realizing you still love it. He is that first day you know autumn is coming because you just feel it.  He is discovering a new song, and falling head over heels for it. He is learning new things. He is the feeling of accomplishment after a day of work doing what you love. He feels like discovery.   Jungkook is a walk in nature. He is water parks in the summer. He is dancing in your living room at 4am because why sleep? He is revisiting old playgrounds and jumping off the swingset. He’s the swooping feeling in your stomach when, in a split second, you’re not sure if you’ll land on your feet. Jeongguk is stargazing a spring night and being able to see every single star. He feels like pure satisfaction with the world.  " False text
