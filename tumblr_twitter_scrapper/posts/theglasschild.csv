It’s not Monday, but it’s the first day of a new year with new possibilities, so here is the first post: “Turning knowledge into action”. I hope you like it :)  Click here to read the whole post I know I’m only 21 years old and that I’m still a kid, wandering, trying to find my way. I don’t have an education or a degree and I never had a real job. I haven’t had a lot of close relationships or friendships and I never learned how to interact with my family. I never had a teacher who…  I’ve been open and interested in people’s beliefs, stories, religions, philosophies and reasons to live. I’ve listened and asked and gathered different theories about what all this is about, without being judgmental. I’ve collected thoughts and reasons just so that I can form my own philosophy from all this. I’m learning Buddhism, poetry, Zen and meditation so that I can take the bits that I want to keep and place it in my own world, and from all this create my own reality. My own story, my own religion - so that I can live my life on my own terms. And that’s the conclusion I’m trying to make. Lately I’ve been feeling the need to get an education, but from all the thinking I’ve done the conclusion is that the only reason to why I want to teach myself, learn and educate myself, is so that I can live my life to my fullest potential, according to me. To be able to live my life exactly in the way I want to live it. So that nothing holds me back, no limitations, only possibilities. So that I can write my own story in my own words.But to be able to write with your fullest potential you need skills, practice and knowledge. That’s the difference between being a good writer and a bad one. A good singer and a bad one -the ability to transform your vision and knowledge into action.  It’s not about learning, it’s about understanding, so that you can transform knowledge into action. Because you can educate yourself and learn everything there is to know, but if you don’t use it, if you don’t transform your knowledge into action, if you don’t live your own personal philosophy, you’ve missed the point.  I’m only 21, but I’m learning, understanding, and then turning it into action, so that I can live my life according to my own belief. And that’s what it’s all about. My reality is up to me to create, no one else. If you take your life in your own hands, no one can take it away from you. Let’s live our lives to our fullest potential this year, and let’s remember that life is happening right here, right now. This is it. Everything you’ve done up until now has lead you to this very moment. And you’re exactly where you’re supposed to be. You have earned the present. Click here to read the whole post   " True link

It’s such a romantic idea - to know that you’re everything to one person. That their world moves because you exist. Doesn’t that amaze you? That your mere existence can bring such joy to a person? It leaves me in awe to know that I could mean so much. The world is hard and cruel, and it’s been a long journey trying to find my place. And one day, I thought I found where I belonged - right next to you. Because you made me smile and made my heart feel freer than it’d ever felt before. I would dare to bet that no one’s ever felt as much joy as you’ve given me. But, you also brought the sadness. Sorrow so deep and aching that I laid in bed for days not moving because the pain was too much to bear. And you promised to never hurt me, and I know you’d never intentionally inflict such wickedness upon me, but it happened all the same. I guess it just proves that you’re human. Someone once told me that I deserve the most love in the entire world. And I think that’s true for everybody. Each person deserves the most. The most happiness. The most love. The most reasons to live. And you’ve given me so much of this. But, I still don’t know if I’m truly yours.

Do not rise because you think being tough makes you smarter (it doesn’t.) Decide to rise because you want to expand — your being, your life, your possibilities. Decide to rise because super powers are meant to be activated and applied in everyday life. Decide to rise to explore your place in the universe. On the other side of deciding to rise is illumination, ecstasy, insight. And the angel of your strength is there waiting, smiling, applauding, with a goblet of endorphins for you. Drink up. When you transcend circumstances you get special privileges. You get evidence that you are indeed amazing, and irrefutable proof that what your heart and mind choose is what matters.
