But since there was so much interest, I ended up thinking about it more. And the direction my thinking took me in was this: what is it that women find attractive in male and female characters, and to what extent does this match up with what men assume that women find attractive in these characters? Here’s the thing: I honestly do not believe that Joss Whedon understands himself as writing for an exclusively male audience. I believe that he thinks to himself: “Wow! This is so great! I’m writing for girls, I’m writing to empower girls, I’m writing the characters that women want!” (For one thing, this is the line that has been fed to him by the media as a positive and important aspect of his work.) There are tons of male writers/directors who are very open about the fact that they are not interested in the female audience. (David Goyer comes to mind.) But Joss Whedon is not one of them. So what is going on with the disconnect between what he understands himself to be doing and what we see him doing? This disconnect doesn’t just have to do with female characters, either. I’m reminded of that Tumblr post that compares two magazine covers featuring Hugh Jackman: a men’s magazine on which he appears bulging-veined, huge-muscled, and sort of terrifying and weird, and a women’s magazine on which he appears as a slim, athletic guy smiling and wearing a sweater. Anyone who reads comics is familiar with this weirdness: comics heroes are often depicted as nightmarishly hyper-muscled, enormous man-mountains. (Interestingly, this trend grew more and more exaggerated as women became more and more nominally liberated— that is, as they should have been more and more able to communicate what they wanted, including what they wanted from men.) Hyper-masculinity is almost always framed in terms of being attractive— to women or, for gay men, to other men— and sometimes even talked about in the same breath as “the female gaze.” Yet, as that Tumblr post points out, while “the female gaze” is attracted by things like a naked, sweaty Chris Evans or Idris Elba, it’s also attracted by things like: men smiling in sweaters, men crying (DON’T LIE TUMBLR), barefoot fragile Sebastian Stan in the rain on Political Animals, men holding babies, men speaking foreign languages, Mark Ruffalo, and a whole bunch of weird stuff on Ao3 that I don’t even wanna get into. And that’s just “the female gaze as it pertains to men.”  But think about whether men would agree that this is what women find attractive in men. Imagine a men’s magazine that offers tips on being attractive to women that include: looking fragile, being a bumbling scientist, acting like a helpless meatball, expressing affection to tiny children, blushing, being intensely interested in gorgeous clothes, etc, etc. This is hard to imagine. In fact, these are characteristics that are typically characterized as not ideal for men, because they are coded as feminine. Yet they’re also not only traits that are commonly attractive to women, but are generally accepted as commonly attractive to women, if one looks at “women’s” entertainment (romantic comedies, chick lit, anything in which Hugh Grant appears).  What I’m getting at is that there is a division between what attracts women and what men accept/permit as attracting women. Men are engaged in a constant enforcement of heteronormativity, a policing of women’s desire and their own accession to it. What women want is subordinate to what men decide that women want, and the latter is then culturally broadcast as the ideological “what women want” that becomes accepted. This is true also in the case of female characters. What do women want in female characters? Well, I mean, a lot of us just want female characters for the love of God. But specifically: some of the most popular current female characters in comics/MCU fandom are: Natasha Romanoff, in a movie (Cap 2) where she only briefly appeared in a sexy bodysuit and instead spent most of her time wearing jeans and a hoodie, wisecracking, having a complex narrative about salvation, and hacking computers, not to mention the down-to-earth Phil Noto comics depiction, who even (GASP) sometimes wears a ponytail; Peggy Carter, a 1940s secret agent with little patience for men; Kamala Khan, a teenage Pakistani-American girl who writes fan fiction and wears a modest homemade costume; Darcy Lewis, who’s full-figured, socially awkward, and not a superhero; the lady scientists of the MCU (Jane Foster, Maya Hansen, Betty Ross)… I could go on. But what do men apparently believe that women want in female characters? Well, going by Joss Whedon: superheroines who wear catsuits, beat up men, are secretly very vulnerable, and are sexually threatened, fragile and unstable girl-women with superpowers beyond their control… oh, wait. That’s it. Expanding beyond Whedon, the most common characteristics tend to be: aggressively sexy, sexually threatened, beats up bad men but is secretly vulnerable. I discussed already one potential reason this is attractive to men (see my previous post); my issue here is: this is not what women want, but it is what men believe that women want, because it is what they have been told by other men that women want.  Once again, what women want is ignored (or, more accurately, invisibilized— in that men deny or are oblivious to its existence) in favor of the ideological construct of “what women want,” which is determined and enforced by men. Men genuinely believe that they know what women want, and are earnest in their attempts to explain “what women want” to women. They are deeply confused, because of course they know what women want! Right? They are unable to see that they are selling a version of “what women want” is essentially “what it would be attractive to men for women to want.”  That is the center of this thing: everything revolves around what men want. What type of female heroine would be most attractive to men? If she has to be strong, what type of strength would men find attractive? How can she be “feminist” but still attractive to men? This seems obvious, yet men seem to find it invisible. One of the most interesting angles from which to consider this is that of the queer/lesbian woman. That is the viewpoint that is most invisibilized in this discussion, because it simply has no relevance or importance to men’s desires. The woman who is not sexually available to men does not exist within a system that assesses women’s value based on sexual availability to men. The gay male gaze is comprehensible, because it can conform to existing ideas about the male body’s desirability (though it does not always). Indeed, the gay male gaze is often preferable to the female gaze, because it sidesteps the problematic female perspective. The lesbian gaze, however, is fundamentally incomprehensible. It is the divide-by-zero point of the system. What does a woman want if she doesn’t want men and doesn’t want what-men-want-from-women? This is the perspective from which it’s easiest to see the bizarreness of what’s going on, the degree to which it is all centrally tied up with men. This is, not incidentally, the reason that it’s so important for women to have creative control over projects. For women to write, produce, direct. As long as men dominate these positions, representations of what women want will be filtered through them. It’s not accidental that two of the most popular female comics characters among women (Kamala Khan and Captain Marvel) are being written by women. We need female creators; we need female voices. It’s the only way to end the invisibilization of women’s desires.  This is a masterpiece    “men” are unable to see that they are selling a version of “what women want” is essentially “what it would be attractive to men for women to want.”    " False text

I’ve been getting some pushback from some writers about my recent post on the knocking-someone-unconscious trope, and I wanted to take a second to address it. Mostly I’ve been challenged to provide a better alternative, which is totally reasonable.   So if we can’t knock people out with head injuries, how do we neutralize enemies without killing them, Aunt Scripty?  (First of all, yes, head injuries can knock people out, it’s just that anything that’s hard enough to knock them out is enough to also kill them or cause permanent brain damage.  This is a really good question, and one I’ve thought about quite a bit. There are a couple of options that I can think of, but I want to make one thing absolutely clear:  Your characters have to be morally prepared for the fact that any of these techniques could still be lethal. If they’re going to be “neutralizing” someone, that means that they may be forced to take a life. It’s a not-so-good option, it’s not the desired outcome, but it’s a very real possibility. If they can’t stomach that thought (or you don’t want to deal with the fallout afterwards), they may need to find another way to accomplish what they want.  Option A: “Be quiet and put your hands up or I’ll shoot you in the head.”  Why is that gun chained to the….? Okay, fine. New plan. Shaw? That’s better. (Side note: do not fuck with Shaw.)  A gun to the head can be very convincing indeed, although your characters have to be ready to pull the trigger if the person offers resistance. A gun should never be drawn if the person drawing it isn’t ready and willing to use it. This should be followed by another character, either the subdued themselves or a second protagonist, duct taping someone’s mouth and binding the hands and feet. (Don’t put anyone on their stomachs and don’t hogtie; these are risky.)  Option B: Ketamine.  You guys, ketamine is my very favorite drug. (By which I mean medication. I have actually never done a drug that was not prescribed to me, and I’m not just saying that in case my bosses find this blog.) [if they found this blog I would be in a world of shit anyway, and i would tell you if i had tried anything interesting, which i have not.]  Of all the sedatives one could theoretically use for a chemical takedown, ketamine would be my choice, primarily for its safety. Benzodiazepines would definitely work, it’s just that one of their major side effects is respiratory depression in high doses. (We routinely use 10mg of midazolam IM at work; I would caution that while this is (usually) (eventually) effective, it takes a few minutes before the struggling winds down, and patients may need airway support if this is done.)  Ketamine, on the other hand, works very well, and patients maintain their own airways pretty well, as well as managing secretions (swallowing). It’s a very popular anesthetic in adult, pediatric, and veterinary medicine (there’s a forthcoming post about sedatives vs analgesics; ketamine actually does both).  The reason I like it for this purpose is multifold. For one, it’s just a neat fucking drug. It doesn’t cause the typical unconsciousness that other anesthetics do; ketamine causes the brain to still be awake, but basically get shut off from the outside world, meaning that the person’s eyes may remain open, and they may have rapid eye movement, but they will not be aware of any outside stimulus. This is really unnerving the first time you see it. Watch this child below:  This kid is fully anesthetized and pain free, even though she looks awake.  It isn’t an instant onset, though, because nothing (except MAYBE propofol) is.  For two, there is basically no upper dose limit on ketamine. Once upon a time a child accidentally got 100x the appropriate dose and was absolutely fine; she was just…. anesthetized for 24 hours. Y’know. Just cuz.  An appropriate dose of ketamine, given in the muscle, is 5 mg/kg; basically, everyone under 220lbs would get 1x 500mg dose (5mL syringe) in the thigh, even though for a smaller person (50kg/110lbs) this is a double-dose. As the mg/kg dose rises, onset quickens; typically it’s about 2 minutes from injection to sedation, but again, quicker in smaller people.  The one thing worth noting here is that actually the max volume any one muscle can really take in is about 5mL, so you may want to have your character duel-wield syringes loaded with ketamine (5ml each) and go for one in each thigh, or double-stab the assmeats, if the person they’re taking down is particularly big.  She will fuck up your day. (source)   You could even do a “will one syringe do?” moment, where your characters have to decide  whether one syringe will “do the job” or if they need two.   The cutoff for a single syringe working is probably around 100kg, or 220 lbs.  One thing here is worth going back to, which is the 2-minute onset. Two minutes is a long time, even if functional resistance is lost sooner. People get angry when you inject them in the butt without their consent. Even if they’re going under sedation, they may struggle and fight and make noise. So your characters need a plan for what to do when the target doesn’t go down immediately.  It’s also worth noting that there can be complications with ketamine. Some people’s larynxes briefly freeze up (laryngospasm), some people get transient apnea, and some people transiently desaturate (blood oxygen % goes down). All of these fall under “probably fine”, but it is worth noting that your characters still may kill someone with ketamine. It’s safer than a head strike or shooting someone, but it’s not 1000% guaranteed to be survivable.  Oh, and a certain number of people, coming up from a ketamine sedation, will have godawful hallucinations, because ketamine is a hallucinogen; this is called an emergence reaction, and may be dramatically useful. Imagine being a bad guy and walking into a room: one of your minions is lying on the floor, eyes open but clearly not awake, and the other is screaming and hallucinating in the corner. Neat.  Option C: The Sleeper Hold / Choke Hold / Kill Someone Hold (NOT SAFE, MINIMALLY EFFECTIVE)  This is a common technique in martial arts. Here we see Hulk Hogan doing this to a reporter (who is a willing participant; we’ll get to why I believe this video in a moment)  Watch how quickly this works: the hold begins with pressure at 0:39, he goes completely limp 7 seconds later (0:46).  Hogan used: Blood Choke! It was very effective!  The downside? The victim wakes up/lifts his head another 11 seconds after that (0:57). In the intervening 11 seconds, Hogan has dropped him on the ground so hard that he hit his head on the hard floor and opened up his scalp. (You can see this at 1:09, when he turns around and the back of his jacket has a good hard smattering of blood on it.)  There are two reasons I believe this video is real: one is the head strike and the blood involved; the other is that he actually sued Hogan for the injury.  There are two kinds of choke holds: blood chokes, which compress the carotid arteries, and air chokes, that compress the trachea and prevent people from breathing. As we can see above, a blood choke is rapidly effective, but also rapid offset. They’re relatively safe in young people, but anyone who may have some plaque building up in the carotid arteries they may have a stroke if the plaque gets broken off from the artery wall.  Air chokes can fracture tracheas and kill people, but they’re probably effective for a little bit longer than above, and are routinely used in martial arts as a “victory hold”, so there’s that.   Option D: A+C or B + C = Effective?  The “ultimate” trope-done-right version of getting a sentry or other bad guy under control may just be a combination: a blood choke for temporary unconsciousness, during which a nice dose of ketamine gets injected in the thigh, or a bad guy willingly takes a sedative rather than get shot in the face.

YOU want to draw a woman in sexy clothes. you can just say that and move on, she’s not real “he holds bigoted beliefs because he has a tragic backstory where he was hurt by someone of x minority, you’re really gonna judge an abuse victim’s coping method?” nothing happened to him either way, you just wanna justify bigoted beliefs, he’s not real “well if a teenager and an old man love each other in this story and are both consenting adults what’s the problem, how can you judge LOVE?” they don’t, that’s just you writing a weird gross story dude, they’re not real  this got a few notes after I went back to sleep and I wasn’t expecting that so I wanna clarify, this isn’t to say that you can’t ever give your characters flaws or have them do things like dress sexily or hold a bias or have whatever characteristic you want them to - after all they’re YOUR character but that’s what I’m saying here, they’re YOUR character, so when people come round asking “why did Name do XYZ” you can’t act as if their actions are above critique or that they made those decisions cause again they’re not real and it was all you bud, have some genuine thought and storytelling to back up things you write rather than transparent mediocre reasons that revolve around fictional character autonomy " False text

They are a wonderful group of people who help make my stories all they can be by providing valuable feedback before publication.One of the first things I noticed with my first round of beta readers was that I wasn’t getting the specific feedback that I was looking for from some of them. The problem was that I hadn’t given them enough direction, giving them the questions I wanted answered. With my first book especially, I wasn’t even sure what those questions were.I’ve done some digging and incorporated questions from various authors who have well worded questionnaires. I can’t recall all of the sources, but one was author Dannika Dark.Now I have my own questionnaire, and I’ve had a lot of requests to see and use it. Rather than giving it to each author individually, I’m posting it here for anyone who would like to use it.Authors, feel free to take all or part of the questionnaire as it applies to your stories. Horror authors, for example, will have some questions that aren’t asked here. Those without romance in their books will want to remove those questions.Beta Reader QuestionnaireThank you for taking the time to read my story! Please read the questions before starting the story, so they’ll be in the back of your mind as you’re reading.Opening:Were the first paragraphs and first page compelling? Did they make you want to keep reading? If not, what was the problem?Did you get oriented fairly quickly at the beginning as to whose story it is, what’s going on, and where and when it’s taking place? If not, what were you confused about at the beginning?Did the story continue to hold your interest through the first few chapters? Or is there a point where your interest started to lag?Characters:Were there characters that needed development or focus?Could you relate to the main character? Did you feel her/his pain, joy, fears, worry, excitement?Which characters did you connect to and like? (Or love to hate?)Are there any characters you think could be made more interesting or more likable?Could the bad guy(s) be nastier or more interesting? How?Did you get confused about who’s who in the characters? Are there too many characters to keep track of? Are any of the names or characters too similar?Did the main characters have chemistry and did their relationship make sense?Which side characters are you curious to know more about after reading this installment?Romance:Did you have to reread any part of the romantic scenes or interactions to figure out what was going on?Did any of the romantic dialogue or interactions make you cringe?Did anything make you feel uncomfortable? What and how?How well did you think the relationship developed between the couple and how did it serve the story?Dialogue:Did the dialogue sound natural to you? If not, whose dialogue did you think sounded artificial?Setting:Were you able to visualize where and when the story is taking place?Did the setting pull you in, and did the descriptions seem vivid and real to you?Plot, Pacing, Scenes:Was the story interesting to you? Did it drag in parts? Where?Which scenes/paragraphs/lines did you really like?Which parts were exciting and should be elaborated on, with more details?Which parts bored you and should be compressed or even deleted? What parts did you dislike or not like as much?Was there anything that confused, frustrated, or annoyed you?What parts resonated with you and/or moved you emotionally?Did you understand every phrase / term I used? If not, which ones?Did you notice any discrepancies or inconsistencies in time sequences, places, character details, plot, etc.?Visual:Can you SEE every action clearly?If you went there in real life, would you recognize the places? If not, elaborate.Did you have to reread any part of the ACTION SEQUENCES to understand who was doing what? List any issues lines/paragraphs that didn’t make sense and required a re-read.Could you SEE what the characters looked like clearly? If not, who?Writing Style/Tone/Voice:Do you think the writing style fits the story and genre? If not, why not?Ending:Was the ending satisfying?Was the ending believable?Grammar, spelling, punctuation:While you were reading, did you notice any obvious, repeating grammatical, spelling, punctuation or capitalization errors?Notes:In your opinion, what are the main strengths of the story? The main weaknesses of the story?Anything additional you want to add?" True text

Oh god yes.  Are there people who don’t realize this? The significant difference between fiction and real life is that in real life things just happen, whereas in fiction things only happen because of choices made by the writer/s. When fancritics talk about manpain, we’re not mocking Bruce Wayne or Dean Winchester for their suffering; we’re mocking the writers for thinking that hurting them is the best way to tell the story, and that killing (usually female) characters they love is the best way to hurt them.  And perhaps more importantly: Killing off female characters is a good way to “hurt” them that won’t actually hurt them or slow them down, it’ll just make them mad. “Manpain” is not the same thing as “pain felt by men”.  Also, male characters get to wallow in their pain and it’s used to justify any amount of bad decisions or antisocial behavior, whereas female characters are supposed to dust themselves off and stop whining, or they’re not “likable.”  Manpain is the prioritization metric that says the lose of one person by a male character in a story must be tended and treated as more significant than any lose faced by a female character. Manpain is the Pain-but-also-not-emotional response of Stoic McGrimFace who expresses his loss through extremely unhealthy coping behaviours like serial killing, mass murder sprees, combat cosplay, and alcoholism. Like, the hardboiled detective novel - a woman walks into the detective’s office to get an investigation into the recent death of her husband last week, and she is supposed to be immediately sexually available to the detective, with no emotional resonance from her husband’s death, whilst Unshaved Broodman of the Clan BroodingManPain is still drinking himself off the force because he lost his buddy back in ‘67 and it’s 1980 That shit is manpain.  Like ManPain™: ask for it by double on the rocks!  Lot of good commentary’s been added to this post since I last saw it. " False text

In a nutshell, Beagle was the victim of a scammer. As a result of this, Beagle is both broke and embroiled in an expensive lawsuit. Here are three ways you can help. SHORT-TERM: Give a birthday gift directly to Peter Beagle via his paypal. If you’re known to me, contact me directly for Beagle’s email address (you can email me, or just leave a message in the comments asking me to email you; if you do that, make sure you comment using your real email address!); or you can go to Adrienne Leigh on Twitter and DM her for the email address. These birthday gifts can be used by Peter Beagle for his household’s immediate day to day needs. (And yes, his birthday is this week!) Please say “happy birthday!” in the Paypal message area. LONG-TERM:Go to the Support Peter Beagle website and use the button there to contribute to a fund to help pay for Peter Beagle’s legal costs. BUY THE HUMBLE BUNDLE!Peter Beagle has curated a Humble Bumble of unicorn fiction, called “Save the Unicorns.” You can pay as little as $1 to get a ton of novels to read, and support Peter Beagle at the same time! Important: In “choose where your money goes,” pick 100% Tachyon Press. Peter Beagle will get royalties and such from Tachyon for these Humble Bumble sales. To be kept up-to-date on Peter Beagle news, follow @RealPeterBeagle on Twitter.  I’ve researched and found this terrible news to be true.This isn’t mermaids - but still in the realm of the fantastic and beautiful (Peter S. Beagle himself being those things…as well as his stories). I would appreciate if my followers could spread this around. Creatives are constantly being taken advantage of, and it’s unfortunate to hear that even Beagle is not immune to this reality. If you can’t donate, please reblog - don’t just like.
