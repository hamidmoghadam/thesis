After all, designing shit is fun! Putting together variously colored stripes and symbols in an aesthetically pleasing yet still meaningful way has its challenges, which makes it something of a test of your artistic ability. But before you go about picking your color scheme, there‚Äôs something we have to go over first, and that‚Äôs whether you need to do this in the first place. So let‚Äôs ask ourselves some questions, yes? Here goes! First question: Is there a pre-existing flag already? For most of you, that answer is no and you‚Äôre allowed to scamper on ahead and not bother with the rest of these questions. But for you few who‚Äôve decided to make a flag when there‚Äôs already a flag, we‚Äôre going to have to dig deeper to see if this is necessary at all. Are you a member of this community? Most people who want to redesign community flags are members of that community, but there are some folks who end up stepping out of line here. Really, if you‚Äôre designing the flag for another group, you should hand the job over to someone who is. No, being kind of similar to actual members doesn‚Äôt make a lick of difference if you don‚Äôt actually identify yourself as belonging to that group. You should not make the flag, or at the very least you should consult the members of that community on it. Is there a good reason to change it? You probably have a reason to change it, but you need to really look at your reason before you commit to this. For example, ‚Äúthis other older flag has one of the same color‚Äù is not a good reason. The Mexican flag and the Italian flag both have green, white, and red. The gay flag has the entire rainbow, and the bi flag shares purple and blue with it. Flags are allowed to share colors. It‚Äôs not stealing. Nobody owns colors. You don‚Äôt need to redesign a flag over that unless the flag is so similar to another flag that you can‚Äôt tell the difference. That would be a good reason. Or if a large part of the community is complaining about a detail (e.g., a lot of aromantic people were bothered by the yellow in the flag cause it was causing them eyestrain so the aromantic flag changed it to white). Does a large part of the community want a new flag? Chances are, that answer is no. Unless there is something very wrong with the current flag, very few will be willing to change. Your efforts will be seen as pointless at best, offensive at worst. Nobody asked for a new flag, nobody wanted a new flag, nobody will want to use your flag. Do not make the flag nobody wanted. There you have it, the questions you need to ask yourself before making a new flag. If your answers determine that a new flag is in order, then have fun creating that new flag! Otherwise, please don‚Äôt make a new flag. Please find something else to do. Please. " False text

I came prepared, with printed and highlighted court cases, state statutes, and title IX excerpts. They didn‚Äôt listen, and refused to provide notes on the meeting or confirm that they had plans to punish me. I listened for about a week, and like before, I grew bolder, and stopped. I concurrently sent a FOIA Request for the communication between the school administration and the attorney, and after that was denied, submitted another request for a clarification of what happened in the meeting and the guidance they had given me. I was called down to my dean‚Äôs office and told to calm down. I didn‚Äôt. I instead sent my principal a letter and CC‚Äôd every faculty member of importance at the school. Mr. Jay Hoffmann and Associates, I regret to inform you that I sustained a mild head trauma some time before break, I am in fair condition and high spirits, but I must alert you to the fact that my memory was slightly affected by the incident and I have lost the ability to recall a particular event that took place in mid October, 2011. While I am not completely able to remember the exact happenings of said event, through a series of email searches I have managed to determine that this meeting concerned my ability to use the bathroom while attending school, but I have no recollection as to what specifically happened at the aforementioned meeting. If there happened to be anything of importance said during the October meeting concerning special instructions on how I am supposed to function within the school due to your understanding of my body or identity, I would like to know. Due to my active role within my community, the chances of me sustaining another memory altering head injury within the near future are staggeringly high‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääif you and your staff would like to avoid explaining what happened in the initial meeting and subsequent meetings with great frequency, as further head injuries occur, I highly suggest that you provide me with an official letter concerning any special instructions or punitive actions to be taken against me if I fail to comply. Since this head injury, I have used the school‚Äôs facilities as permitted by the Illinois Human Rights Act and will continue to do so until I am told differently in writing. Please note that any punitive actions taken against me will most likely result in a filing with the Human Rights Committee, FOIA requests for all communications pertaining to the event, press releases, news tips, and the raising of community awareness. I didn‚Äôt get called to the office anymore after this. In fact, the administration refused to speak with me until after I graduated. I didn‚Äôt get in trouble, and since I left, there have been roughly a dozen other trans kids who have gone un-bothered by the administration Could this have gone differently, particularly if I wasn‚Äôt in a state with laws on the books to help me? Definitely. But the point is, draconian laws are much harder to enforce on people who will fight you. If you‚Äôre a trans high schooler, have Title IX complaints typed up‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyes, you can still file those‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand let your administration know that you have them. Go scream at your school board until they carry you out. Show up at your principal‚Äôs office until you become a nuisance. Fax your superintendent until their machine runs out of ink. Send FOIA requests for everything you can think of, costing your school time and money. They want us to cower, so don‚Äôt.  I am proud to share a state with this young woman. Fantastic work, @alx-972 and that‚Äôs some seriously awesome lateral thinking.¬† Congratulations on graduation and keep fighting and inspiring! " False link

I cannot stress it enough. I do not normally compose posts regarding current issues, but as mental abuse is a subject that is incredibly sensitive to myself and others, I cannot keep silent on this and allow it to slide by without attempting to do something.¬†I would like to preface this post with a warning that the video which I have linked above contains disturbing scenes of child abuse, some physical violence, with additional screaming, threats, and horrible, outright traumatic behavior. If you are unable to watch these sorts of scenes, I will detail them below.¬† For those of you familiar with the¬†‚ÄòDaddyOFive‚Äô situation, it is a compilation taken straight from the channel with every instance of the father abusing the son, Cody. For those of you who are not familiar with this, allow me to break it down for you.¬†The YouTube channel called DaddyOFive is run¬†by a man blogging about his family‚Äôs everyday life and regularly uploading ‚Äúprank‚Äù videos. This man and his wife prank each other and their children, who are also made to prank each other for more material they put into monetized videos. An important thing to note is that the wife is not the mother of Cody, the son who is regularly abused in these videos.¬†As you will see in the video, the way they treat their children -¬†especially Cody, who is no older than 10 years old -¬†is sickening, violent, traumatic,¬†and it is, in reality, the monetization of child abuse veiled with the name of¬†‚Äúprank‚Äù. Pranks are meant to be amusing and, at their worst, mildly upsetting. They are not intended to cause extreme scarring and trauma to children, but that is the only thing that results from DaddyOFive‚Äôs treatment/¬†‚Äòpranks‚Äô of his children, Cody included. As one user has stated, ‚ÄúHe seems to be the only one of the children who gets visibly upset over his parents‚Äô ‚Äúpranks‚Äù fairly frequently, begging them to leave him alone and quit messing with him and yelling at them to stop.‚Äù¬† They constantly follow him around with their camera, not giving him any personal space and filming as many of his reactions as possible to humiliate him in front of thousands of viewers.There are clips of him screaming at his son, accusing him of weakness and bad behavior, gas-lighting him and manipulating him into believing he is the one in the wrong. There are clips of him egging on his other children to converge on Cody and beat him up. Even more disturbing than that are instances in which the father pushes Cody face-first into a bookshelf. He is later shown sobbing on his bed, with a bloody nose and a blood-splotched pillow. DaddyOFive, of course, claimed it was just red ink.¬†On top of that, DaddyOFive uploaded a video titled ‚ÄúBLOCKING ALL THE HATERS‚Äù, ranting about the people complaining about their videos and pointing out how horribly they treat their kids in front of his children, even making sure they listen to every word he says. And this morning, he uploaded yet another video which, in summation, accuses the viewers of being the evil ones manipulating the children, while they, the parents, have committed no wrongdoings. The children, Cody included, are encouraged to believe that their parents have done nothing wrong - one child even says¬†‚Äúat least you don‚Äôt hit us like most parents‚Äù (which is not true in Cody‚Äôs case.)¬†I encourage everyone to watch this video to get a better idea of the situation. If you can, that is. If at all possible, please DONATE to this GoFundMe:¬†https://www.gofundme.com/save-cody-and-emma¬†It is to get Cody out of this situation and back to his biological mother, and away from the horrible abuse he has to endure.

The writers and producers of Legendary Defender have been unnecessarily vague about the ages of the main characters - Allura, Hunk, Lance, Pidge, Keith, and Shiro - despite fans‚Äô asking for canon ages since the first season aired in June of 2016. Up until now, the answers fans have gotten have been vague, and frankly a large portion of the fanbase finds this ridiculous. Why keep such basic character facts a secret? Revealing the ages of these characters won‚Äôt spoil any of the plot details that are to come in future seasons, and only serves as an inconvenience to fans. Other animated children‚Äôs shows such as Star vs. the Forces of Evil and Gravity Falls have confirmed their character‚Äôs ages with no repercussions. If anything, it only makes fans more willing to engage with and continue supporting the show. The recent video in which Joaquim Dos Santos refers to Princess Allura, one of the main characters, has caused tidal waves amongst fans as a majority of the show‚Äôs fanbase had interpreted interactions between Allura and Shiro, another one of the main characters, as romantic. The problem here is that in a video from San Diego Comic Con 2016, Lauren Montgomery, Tim Hedrick, and Dos Santos told fans Shiro was 25. As most people know, a 25 year old and a teenager should not be interacting romantically. So what are we, the fans, supposed to make of this? It makes us insecure, it makes us distrust the writers and producers of the show, it makes us angry, and it has made many fans distance themselves completely from the show. The goal with this petition is to get answers. The fanbase wants to know the ages of the characters, a harmless fact that will not spoil any future plot details. What will be achieved by giving the fans precise ages? We will start trusting and believing in the team behind Voltron: Legendary Defender again, we will be more inclined to engage with the show and share it with friends & family, and we will keep supporting the show. Hopefully this get enough signatures to garner the attention of the show‚Äôs creators. Perhaps, once they see how many of us are dissatisfied, they will stop with these ridiculously vague statements and give us some numbers.  SIGN HERE " False link

Now I feel sorry for that designer. She has her name on this forever I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre letting us know Emma did the most but I can‚Äôt believe that they would let her choose the methods of construction too like someone has to be to blame for that. This dress looks like it costs about 299.99.  Yeah I‚Äôm going to go ahead and guess that this was a team effort. Emma can‚Äôt be entirely to blame and neither can the designer- Emma had creative power, and she is clearly better at acting than costume design, but the designer is responsible for deciding the actual construction methods that will be used either way, together they created a bland prom dress in place of a fantasy Rococo gown and I am irritated " False link

So angry. Listen to me. I do not care whether or not you believe vaccines cause autism. Even though studies have shown time and time again that vaccines don‚Äôt cause autism and the original study stating that there was a link with autism and vaccines was fraudulent, it does not matter. The reason that people are concerned about vaccines causing autism is because they‚Äôre not thinking of the long-term. Here‚Äôs the truth: when you are choosing to not having your child vaccinated because you‚Äôre afraid of autism, you are actively choosing death over a neurodevelopmental disorder. Let me phrase that in another way ‚Äì you are either picking autism or death. It doesn‚Äôt have to be the death of your¬†child. It can be literally any child. And death is the worst case scenario. Autism is not the worst case scenario. Death is always and will constantly be the worst case scenario. There are children who are too young to get vaccines. There are kids who have compromised immune systems that cannot get vaccines. Your child getting vaccinated prevents these illnesses from spreading and keeps those children safe. It‚Äôs called community immunity and it‚Äôs important to maintain that so people don‚Äôt die. tl;dr - Stop being a selfish asshole and get your kids vaccinated. There are worse things in the world than autism. And before anyone starts coming to my inbox screaming about how¬†‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how bad autism can be‚Äù, I know. Not only do I have a neurodevelopmental disorder, but I also had a friend with a severely autistic brother that could not talk when he was fifteen. I know. And even after witnessing him and being through my own shit, I would still get my kids vaccinated because I want them, and other kids, to live.  WTF, people. Why the fuck do you think that your fear of autism (ungrounded, btw), beats someone else‚Äôs RIGHT TO LIVE?!?! You don‚Äôt want to vaccinate your kid. Goody gumdrops. You expose your godchild - who‚Äôs too young to be vaccinated. You expose your sister-in-law - who is going through chemo (because having cancer isn‚Äôt bad enough), and immunocompromised. You expose everyone they¬†come in contact with¬†- BECAUSE MEASLES STAYS ACTIVE FOR UP TO TWO HOURS ON SURFACES AND IN THE AIR OF A SPACE. Number of people killed by symptoms associated with autism diagnoses: 0. Number of people killed by measles in 2015: 134,000 Number of people killed per annum before vaccination became widespread in 1980: 2,600,000¬†(paraphrased from WHO).

zooweamama 158107074307 "2017-03-07 12:36:34 GMT" https://zooweamama.tumblr.com/post/158107074307/hey-about-those-consent-cards "rapeculturerealities:  Hello, overwhelming majority. I‚Äôm really glad you‚Äôre coming to my class, too. I know that many of you understand what I‚Äôm about to say without me needing to say it. But this post is particularly for those of you who roll your eyes when I hand the cards out, and for those of you who think the cards are funny, or stupid, or ridiculous. This is particularly for a couple of you who refuse to take a card because you know that I know that you love adjustments, and also for the fellow who shook his head when he saw them and said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a shame that it‚Äôs come to this.‚Äù  I want to thank you for the way that you are contributing to the yoga classroom as a safe space. The term ‚Äúsafe space‚Äù has taken a lot of heat in the current political milieu, and it now conjures notions of catering to some impossibly fragile ‚Äúsnowflake.‚Äù But the fact is that we all need safe spaces, and we need them all the time. You know when you aren‚Äôt thinking about safe space and the concept itself seems laughably unnecessary? That‚Äôs because, in that moment, YOU ARE IN A SPACE IN WHICH YOU FEEL SAFE. For those of us whose identities and sensibilities interface pretty seamlessly with mainstream cultural conventions, safe space is often effortless, and therefore invisible. But in the event that we feel threatened, vulnerable, or in danger, we come to understand what safe space really is; it is in its absence that we recognize its essence. Take, for example, a hypothetical person named TwentyEight, whose name honors the 28% of U.S. youth between 14 and 17 years of age who report being sexually victimized in their lifetime. 1  Because of their past trauma, TwentyEight has a very different relationship to touch than you or I. Touch is welcome for TwentyEight only in highly specific contexts with very close friends and intimates. Unexpected physical contact is violently triggering to TwentyEight‚Äôs nervous system and can quickly promote agonizing levels of anxiety, fear, and stress. TwentyEight has great need for the profoundly calming and grounding benefits of therapeutic yoga practice, but it is often impossible to find a suitable context in which to receive them. It takes extraordinary courage for TwentyEight to show up to a yoga studio since a typical class environment is treacherous: a well-meaning instructor might lay a hand on TwentyEight in the wrong place and provoke in them a psychological space that is the exact opposite of the intended effect of the class. I really want TwentyEight to show up for class. I want them to be able to access yoga. Though I‚Äôm comfortable with touch, I have my own traumas that I‚Äôve seen the practice support and transform, and I have a particular affinity for people who demonstrate the fierce passion for yoga that is often a result of needing it so profoundly. So, I know the cards are a little annoying, particularly when you don‚Äôt need them. Many of you take my class every week, and we‚Äôve had coffee, and we‚Äôve talked through some really personal stuff together, which makes the card seem absurd: don‚Äôt I know that you would tell me if you didn‚Äôt want an adjustment? I do know that, I really do. As I‚Äôm handing you the card, I‚Äôm aware that it‚Äôs probably an unnecessary exchange between us, and maybe it even feels like when you lean in to hug a friend and they extend their hand so you can shake it instead. I get it. But please know this: when I‚Äôm handing you a consent card, and you place it by your mat, our actions are not in service of either of us. They‚Äôre in service of TwentyEight, even when they‚Äôre not in the room. We are creating our own convention, a foundation for safe space, and my hope is that the word eventually gets out to TwentyEight that they are welcome here, among us, where they can breathe and move and seek out a little peace just like we do. And because we want to make TwentyEight (and anyone who‚Äôd prefer not to be touched for any reason) comfortable, we all use the cards; I designed them so that the distinction between sides is subtle. If they need to flip their card to the No Thanks side, it‚Äôs not putting them under a microscope. And that‚Äôs why everybody has to take a card, and why your completely harmless jokes about them would be better left unsaid. We use the cards respectfully, unassumingly, so that we can support those who need them. We‚Äôll know it‚Äôs working when your majority is not quite so overwhelming, and more touch-averse people are finding it comfortable to practice with us. It takes tremendous skill to cultivate safe space. It requires the strength of character to be comfortable in one‚Äôs own skin while actively supporting the capacity for others‚Äô comfort. For the manly men among you who practice with me, your arm balances are impressive, but the strongest thing you can do in my class is fortify and protect the room as a liberated learning environment for all manner of people. I‚Äôm so grateful for the way that you express and experience your physicality on your mat while holding the space with integrity for others to do the same. I want to thank all of you for hearing me out on this one. Thank you for acknowledging the value of diversity in our practice space, for all of us. I love the beautiful complexity of our community, and I believe our shared experience of difference is one of the most reliably inspiring aspects of what happens when we unroll our mats.
