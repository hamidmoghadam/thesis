Why was she angry? 2. Where were you taking her on the bus? Is there a leash-free snake park where you live? I need to know.   1. she’s a cranky ass in general, but her mood was absolutely not improved by eating a bit of a snake hook, getting stuffed in a sack, experiencing an hour of adelaide’s finest public transport, and having a vet jam a tube into her stomach 2. i think all of australia is technically a leash-free snake park tbh  I am so glad there was follow up on this post explaining why the snake was on the bus!!!

He’s made me and other kids cry more than once and he and his teacher buddies make a joke out of terrifying students.  this was women in general? i knew my gf didn’t like it but I was unaware if this affected most women  Yes, it does  As a woman, I had no idea it effected other women like this. I was too afraid to even talk about it. I thought I was weak. Thanks for bringing attention to this.  My dad thinks it’s funny that I used to cry when he raised his voice. I freak out whenever some one does. Once my director did, and I started crying I couldn’t stop. I’m glad to see I’m not alone…  This is so important– seeing how common this is– and I also want you all to know that this is not normal. It isn’t something instinctively ingrained into women, to be afraid of men. There is no natural state of men being a threat that women constantly have to be afraid of. This is cultural. So many women and girls here have a mutual understanding of this feeling, and I think it really shows an unsettling truth about our society, particularly about how men are raised to act and how so many women have this defensive reaction gradually develop. It’s so important that these people have their voices heard, because it teaches us about problems that we just can’t deny the existence of any longer.  I’m glad I’m not the only one  My fellow men, pay attention. I didn’t realize how scary this could be until one of my exes explained it to me, and it’s heartbreaking.   Also, when we move too much during an argument, or lean forward, it’s scary, and I never knew. I was even a little insulted at first, because surely she didn’t think I would hurt her. But see, that doesn’t matter. It wasn’t a sign that she mistrusted me specifically; it’s a conditioned response. (Although if you keep doing it once you realize it scares her, she SHOULDN’T trust you.)  Not every woman has been physically harmed by a man she trusted, but every woman KNOWS a woman who has.  I used to be horrible about this, because I didn’t realize how intimidating it was. I didn’t understand why the woman I was with clammed up or tried to tell me what she thought I wanted to hear, and I only got angrier, and acted even more like an asshole. It was wrong. It was abusive. It didn’t matter if I INTENDED it that way; it was still emotionally abusive. And it was inexcusable.  I get that when passions are high, and when you’re frustrated, it’s a natural tendency to let your voice get louder, to shout and gesture and lean forward. But you can train yourself to do better. You can train yourself to keep more of an even tone, to refrain from large and fast gestures, to not lean into her personal space. I did. I’m not perfect at it yet, but goddamn it, I WILL be.  Don’t tell me it’s too hard, that you just can’t do it, or that you “shouldn’t have to.” I’m 53 years old and just now getting the hang of it, and if this old dog can learn something new, so can you.   Pay attention to that last reblog.@anexperimentallife, thank you. I hope more men take your lead.  I had a professional mediator pull this on me when I was working a child custody case because I was trying to argue against granting an extension of time. It was years ago but I’ll never forget it.  " False text

(not to bash canon ron&harry, the bros to end all  bros, but by putting this very obvious obstacle between them– it makes  it that much clearer to the reader that this is a love worth fighting  for, because they’re fighting for it). ron being jealous  that harry and hermione get to share this house, this home, these  hours, while he’s stuck with malfoy and parkinson and goyle– because  that would eat him up some days, some months, this insecure kid who’s  been the last at everything all his life. this kid who always leaves and  always comes back. ron,  who constantly compares himself to his brothers– not as smart, not as  popular, not as good. one more nail in that coffin, here, yeah? he’s not  a prefect, not a quidditch star, not a troublemaker– and even when he  becomes those things, someone else has always gotten there first.  well, i guess he got to this house first at leastron still snaps at snape in potions, after hermione’s been ignored  three times, “you know, sir, i think hermione might know the answer.” he  still pulls the bars off harry’s window with a stolen, flying car. he  still shows harry around the burrow shyly, not knowing what a wonder a  warm home is. he still stands up in the shrieking shack as best as he  can with a broken leg and tells a mass murderer that if he wants harry  he’ll have to go through him first.  ron weasley is a lot of things, but one of them is absolutely a true friend.in their second year:  when everyone calls harry the heir, they eye ron at  his side and sniff. when hermione lays petrified in the medical ward,  ron sits at her side and reads her homework assignments aloud and thinks  my house this was my house.  when ron hugs ginny’s damp, shaking frame after the chamber, ron says sorry and sorry and are you okay and i’m so sorry and ginny calls him an idiot.  the  trio spends more time in the library with hermione, since ron can’t  come to gryffindor tower to study, and homework remains a thing that has  to happen. fred and george constantly try to sneak him into the tower  anyway.  “c'mon, ronnykins, you belong here, you deserve it, no  one’s gonna fuss, it’s your BIRTHRIGHT,” and ron fusses and rolls his  eyes at them and then in fourth year in one of those periods where he’s not talking to harry and harry’s not talking to him– he just snaps  at the twins because it’s not, alright?  not his birthright, not his  house, and maybe no one would fuss if he snuck in, maybe no one would care, and that makes it worse not better, because then he’s just that weasley who should’ve been gryffindor  and isn’t (and  harry overhears this caterwauling, feels his heart fall to his toes,  and goes and awkwardly asks ron if he wants to go a few laps on his  firebolt).  (because, god, harry-the-chosen-one, harry-in-the-cupboard-under-the-stairs, harry-who’ll-save-us-all– he knows what it’s like to have should have beens on your shoulders, and he knows what it’s like to not be wanted).  ron cheers for gryffindor during quidditch matches  in those first few years, and sits with hagrid and hermione and neville.  harry’s seeker, and fred and george are beaters, and ginny becomes  chaser eventually, and honestly screw the slytherin team. they have each  and every one of them said disparaging things about ron’s mother. harry  and hermione badger ron into trying out for keeper fourth year; he and  harry have been practicing on the quidditch pitch because its a  non-library-shaped place to hang out where both of them are allowed. ron  makes the slytherin roster, and malfoy grudgingly provides ron a team  broom after the captain chews him out for a bit.  “he may be a weasley, but he’s our keeper, don’t you want to win, draco”but  the sort of things they spit in the locker room, the words the  players hiss or snigger, the slurs that come easy to their tongues–  ron would like to say that he considered just walking out of the  cesspit, but instead he snipes and sasses and shouts and sometimes tries  to spell slugs at the worst of them.  it doesn’t do  much, that one irritated voice of protest– except that it does. and  he’s got a new (hand-me-down) wand, after the gilderoy fiasco, so the  slugs even come out the right end.fred gives him a black eye with a bludger one time (though ron does  manage to block the quaffle) and molly sends a howler to gryffindor  table with the morning post. (“RON DID YOU TATTLE”) (“IT WAS CLEARLY  PERCY, FRED, SIT DOWN”) (the weasleys often have family  conversations across the great hall, with hufflepuffs and ravenclaws  covering their ears long-sufferingly between them) in  the lake, it’s still ron hanging there in the water, still and bloated.  it’s still harry’s heart that stutters in his chest, for all it’s just a  game, just a game, just a game, right? ron  listens hard and tries to talk himself out of fist fights, all that  next year in the slytherin common room as they read aloud rita skeeter  articles.  when hermione calls dumbledore’s army to  its first session in that pub, there are green scarves in that crowd–  ron and one of the beaters who ron’s gotten to help glare to rest of the  slytherin quidditch team into submission. ron beats draco to  being prefect (i think i remember it was  dumbledore and not mcgonagall who seemed to award prefect status– snape  doesn ’t get a say).  percy is SO PROUD, as usual, but so are fred and  george. “did you see the little malfoy git? green with shame, my god.”when harry has the dream about sirius, ron isn’t  there to wake. but when draco’s pulled out of bed to be a professional  bully– er, i mean inquisitorial squad member– ron follows at a careful  distance and curses draco from behind.  they ride thestrals over  london. harry finds the prophecy and ron thinks about the sorts of  things that get decided at your birth.   sirius black was a son of slytherin who had a lion living in his chest that he couldn’t hide away.  ron was meant to be gryffindor, and through a haze of injury and fear he watches sirius die just out of harry’s reach. just imagine: ron with his temper and his sharp  words and his fierce loyalty. ron who looks into the mirror of erised  and sees house cups and prefect badges and ambitions earned– he could  belong in slytherin. there is nothing wrong with wanting things, and he  wants them so bad. there are so many reasons to fight a war, and  so many ways. harry and his sacrifices, his loving resignation.  hermione’s good right hook and bottomless bag of supplies. luna,  brilliant and a bit batty. lee jordan’s radio and mcgonagall’s burning  patience and brittle, certain bones.  just imagine: when the last battle comes, there is a slytherin on the field who is not snape. when draco and his parents walk away, in that last battle, ron–  who slept in the same  dormitory as the boy for six years who heard draco’s nightmares and saw  him paling and desperate all sixth year who is as pureblooded as  lucius’s spoiled whelp who remembers grimacing at the thought of  squibs who has known magic all his life who spotted draco penning letters  home to his mother every sunday and hiding them when the other boys could  see–  ron sees them going.  he sounds no alarms. he says no farewells.  he turns back to his friends, and his fight, and lets them be. just  imagine: when harry kneels on the train platform and his second son  asks him “but what if i get sorted slytherin, dad?” harry can say, “the  bravest man i ever knew was in slytherin house. whatever you are,  wherever you go, we’re going to be so proud of you.“  and  they can both gaze over to where ron is squawking beside his daughter’s  trolley of luggage because crookshanks (who will live to be forty eight  million years old) has latched onto his shins with a violent fondness.

This cookbook is full of delicious and healthy recipes, the ingredients of which are fairly inexpensive.  I ACKNOWLEDGE THIS WOMAN AS A FELLOW WARRIOR AND A FANTASTIC HUMAN BEING.   Boost so hard. Feeding yourself well is a challenge when you”ve got little income  I HAVE BEEN USING THIS COOKBOOK FOR MONTHS AND IT’S AMAZING 100/10 RECOMMENDING EVERYWHERE (just to give you an idea, my food budget is 30 euro/week at most [about $38] and I have to maintain a healthy diet due to weird medication side-effects and yeah, basically this book is a lifesaver if you’re broke but need to watch what you’re eating)  Reblog to save a life. Because it’s easy to find food for $4/day, but most of it tends to be garden variety junkfood  (The pdf is free, I repeat, the pdf is free)   And yeah, even if you’re not going to use 90% of the recipes, it’s always good to have spare recipe reference points. To quote a dear departed Portland television pitchman, “Free is a very good price.”  If you can afford to buy it, I urge you to do so! It’s a great cookbook with great pictures and it’s important to support the author! (If you can!) :) " False link

It’s the utter bane of my existence when people send me their manuscripts to edit, and I get a cover email that read along the lines of “I’m not a fan of romance novels so I added my own twist” and my soul curdles because first of all a) if you don’t like romance but you’re writing it because you’ve realized it’s lucrative and you think Anyone can do it because it’s “easy”: get the Hell out of my genre and b) suffering and misery instead of a happily ever after (or happy for now) are not twists. It’s not edgy, it’s not clever, in fact what it shows me is that you do not understand the genre on a fundamental level and shouldn’t be writing for it. Romance is a fantasy genre, people don’t read fantasy for endless suffering (thank you GRRMartin et al for making every edgelord in the world think nitty gritty detail = pain and suffering without relief and flooding the genre with their shitty reimaginings of the characters from Lord of the Rings but set to the plot of SAW) they read fantasy to know that the suffering  will end. That evil will eventually be defeated, that good things can and will still happen and that the sun will shine again. Romance is no different from that, except it is a genre primarily considered to be feminine and therefore subject to ridicule and the belief that somehow if a woman can do it, it must be easy “But Joy,” I hear some of you say, “Romance doesn’t have that reputation because of sexism, it’s because of how many bad writers get published in it and make it look bad.” *angry buzzer sound* oh I’m sorry that was incorrect, you see every genre has an abundance of shitty books that make it to print, whether it’s goofball sci-fi or Lord of the “all my characters are white because of historical accuracy” Rings 94949392.0 (or if you really want to start a fight, every mediocre white man considered a classic by the literary genre and lauded by academia for writing about wanting to have an affair with one of his students/the inevitability of death) and while they are subject to criticism, there’s still not quite the same vitriol that Romance gets for wanting, what is essentially, a happy life. There is nothing wrong with feel good media, there is nothing wrong with wanting to enjoy something a little bit silly and unapologetically happy. The popularity of coffee shop Aus in fandom is both unsurprising and nothing new. It’s quite literally common romance tropes that have been around forever but with the diversity of fandom (*eyes ao3 tag* kind of) and I will die on this hill defending the validity of Happily Ever Afters and Happily For Now before I let anyone try to take it from my icy cold grip. And if I get one more romance manuscript with a cover letter that says they’ve added a twist, then god dam y'all someone had better have twisted their ankle and been carried bridal style to their bed because I’m so over people hating on the simple want for happiness.  THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH FEEL GOOD MEDIA." False link

We created a series that was lit incredibly dark, visually, very dark, very live-action lightning, but made it unique.” In his interview Del Toro speaks of aspiring to a Gravity Falls level of excellence, the troubles of reconciling dreams and the need to stay on budget, and using inspiration from reality in everything from the writing to the lighting: When you watch [Hayao] Miyazaki or a beautiful animated movie like A Letter to Momo, this is something that the Japanese do a lot in the higher quality animation, which I think Miyazaki calls “Ma.” When you do Ma, the characters seem a little more alive. These are decisions that affect the quality of a series without affecting it to go over budget; you can stay on-budget but be creatively a little crazier, and the result is actually a little better.

If you haven’t, it’s now streaming on Netflix… - Courtney (harmonicacave)  Oh you know just casually thinking about how cool it could have been to have a Trollhunters movie (cough perhaps cough cough instead of Trolls?)"

But they won’t be. Those directors are Pete Docter and Charlie Kaufman. They’re about to get snubbed.  Screencrush’s Mike Sampson published an absolutely fascinating account of why, time and again, talented directors are being discounted in the Oscars.  Here’s one of my favorite parts, below. Many years ago, when animated films were released more sparingly, there may have been some justification in the DGA and the Academy to keep animation and live-action separate. But as animation becomes a more dominant art form both critically and commercially (five of the 20 highest grossing films of 2015 were animated films), they deserve to be treated as equals. They speak to us, move us, and change our lives just like any other film out there. You’ll want to read the whole article for yourself, trust me, but here are some highlights (below the cut): Keep reading  COME ON!!!  Oscar season boost.  How are they going to get “snubbed”? The race is so clearly between them two. One will win, one will have almost won. Then getting snubbed would be if Shaun the Sheep wins.  For me, the feeling of being snubbed is not that either of these will not win best animated feature. It’s the daily problem of animated films not getting proper recognition as films in general.  My tag about it, though, if that’s what you mean, was based on the hope Animation Force would show up in the tags on Sunday when people were angry about some other category heehee." False link
