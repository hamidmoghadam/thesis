She learns that she doesn’t have to change anything about herself to be awesome because she already is.” According to the filmmaker, Arbour’s video really hit home. “I’m gay. I was bullied a lot as a kid,” he reasons. “I am no stranger to ridicule and loneliness.” “[‘Dear Fat People’] is an unfunny and cruel fat-shaming video that guises itself about being about ‘health’,” Mills says of the clip. “It’s fat phobic and awful.

It celebrates not fitting in. I want to arm teen girls of all sizes with confidence. People like Nicole Arbour strip this confidence away.” At the end of his statement, Mills directs the YouTuber directly: “Nicole: Did you even read my script? It is a body positive teen movie.

Another factor they addressed that I hadn’t thought of before was the fact that a lot of women and girls work in service positions, or positions that require a lot of interaction with other people (i.e. teaching, nursing, etc.) Whereas a lot of the men and boys who game work in more solitary positions.
