There is lots of partying involved, and consequently, a lot of work for sanitation workers before the New Year morning. In 2015, the Department of Sanitation in New York City estimated close to 50 tons of trash in Times Square alone. For the last many years, the Ahmadiyya Muslim Youth Association in many countries has spent the New Years morning cleaning up the mess left behind from the night prior. Youth typically gather in their local mosques and community centers on New Year‚Äôs Eve for a sleep-over, rise early for the pre-dawn Tahajjud prayer to supplicate for peace, harmony and coexistence in the world and then proceed to clean their respective neighborhoods and cities.   Jihad, an often misunderstood word, literally means struggle. In its essence, it refers to the continuous struggle to improve oneself, and the community one lives in. Here is a short piece I wrote on this topic. In this age, Ahmadi Muslims also promote an intellectual #JihadOfThePen to counter false propaganda against the Islamic faith with reasoning and dialogue.¬†   Bilal Ahmad, a young professional who also serves as the vice president of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Youth Association in Rotherham, U.K., said cleaning the streets was the Muslim way to welcome the New Year.   And while the boys and young men cleaned the cities, women visited homeless shelters to provide food and clothing.¬†   Similar activities were underway in the streets of Zurich in Switzerland,   New Zealand, Belgium, the Netherlands, Canada and many other countries.   Young Muslims in Saskatoon visited senior living facilities in the region with flowers and gift packets.    Humanity First International, a charity founded by the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community over 20 years ago, led clean-up activities in Indonesia. Mr. Kandali Achmad, the National Director of Humanity First Indonesia shared pictures on his Facebook page.     Muslim youth in the United Arab Emirates marked New Years Day by cleaning up the area in front of Burj Khalifa, the tallest structure in the world, before proceeding to donate blood at local blood donation centers. Humanity First Dubai helped organize this event.     The media often depicts Muslims in a negative light. One case of a lunatic carrying out an act of violence, and there are special coverage‚Äôs on media platforms around the world with pundits and ‚ÄúIslam experts‚Äù pointing fingers at a whole faith community. But this right here is what Muslims really do every day in their communities. And it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if you do not hear about this on mainstream media.     If we care about fighting unjust stereotypes, we must also share these stories with the world. We must all appreciate the fact that while many were asleep, hundreds of young Muslim doctors, engineers, lawyers, businessmen, politicians, cab drivers, students, etc came together to make sure the rest of us have a very good morning and to wish us a Happy New Year.

Hussain, who is himself an American Muslim, contends that Muslims played an essential role in the creation and cultivation of the United States. Memories of 9/11 and the rise of global terrorism fuel concerns about American Muslims. The fear of American Muslims in part stems from the stereotype that all followers of Islam are violent extremists who want to overturn the American way of life. Inherent to this stereotype is the popular misconception that Islam is a new religion in America. In¬†‚ÄúMuslims and the Making of America‚Äù Hussain directly addresses both of these stereotypes. Far from undermining America, Islam and the American Muslims have been, and continue to be, important threads in the fabric of American life. Hussain chronicles the history of Islam in America to underscore the valuable cultural influence of Muslims on American life. He then rivets attention on music, sports, and culture as key areas in which Muslims have shaped and transformed American identity. America, Hussain concludes, would not exist as it does today without the essential contributions made by its Muslim citizens.   Dr. Amir Hussain is Professor of Theological Studies at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, where he teaches courses on world religions. His own particular speciality is the study of Islam, focusing on contemporary Muslim societies in North America.¬† Table of Contents Introduction: The American ideal and Islam Islam in America: a short history Blues for Allah: music The greatest: sports Muslims on the American landscape: culture Conclusion: The poetry of ordinary American Muslim lives Includes bibliographical notes.

Few are the presidents who cemented their foreign policy legacy before taking office, but Trump‚Äôs pre- and post-election threats to upend the U.S.-China relationship may turn out to be his biggest gamble. Continuing his attack on the longstanding Washington foreign-policy consensus that China must be handled with a delicate touch, he and his team have doubled down on calling out Beijing‚Äôs trade practices and its aggressive moves toward its neighbors.

Trump has pledged an investigation of voter fraud in the wake of his unfounded claims that between 3 million and 5 million fraudulent votes were cast in the 2016 election. In response to a question from Congressman Mo Brooks of Alabama, who described Trump as being ‚Äúspot on‚Äù on the issue, Pence described the investigation that the administration is planning on undertaking. The vice-president, who focused on a Pew Research Center report often cited by Trump that referenced issues with faulty voter registrations, pledged to members of Congress: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be looking at ways to work with you and follow the facts and see where the facts go.‚Äù The White House is expected to release an executive order on voter fraud in the coming days. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, described the effort to reporters on Wednesday as an attempt ‚Äúto understand where the problem exists, how deep it goes‚Äù. Spicer indicated that potential fraud only happened in ‚Äúthe bigger states‚Äù. In two tweets earlier this week, Trump said, ‚ÄúI will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and ‚Ä¶ even, those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures!‚Äù Trump won the electoral college in November but lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by about 3m votes. Without any evidence, he claimed last year that millions of ‚Äúillegal‚Äù immigrants had cast ballots, and that he otherwise would have won the popular vote. His rhetoric on the topic echoed claims of a ‚Äúrigged‚Äù election that Trump had made throughout the election. The president‚Äôs claims of voter fraud have earned condemnation from both Democrats and Republicans, who argue that the allegations threaten to undermine voters‚Äô confidence in the process. Lindsey Graham, a senator for South Carolina, urged Trump to cease making these kinds of statements, saying, ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt there, but if the president of the United States is claiming that 3.5 million people voted illegally, that shakes confidence in our democracy ‚Äì he needs to disclose why he believes that.‚Äù Graham continued: ‚ÄúI would urge the president to knock this off; this is the greatest democracy on Earth, we‚Äôre the leader of the free world, and people are going to start doubting you as a person if you keep making accusations against our electoral system without justification. This is going to erode his ability to govern this country if he does not stop it.‚Äù House speaker Paul Ryan also distanced himself from Trump‚Äôs claims, saying: ‚ÄúI have no way of backing that up.‚Äù   " False link

The Washington Post first reported their departures. Each of the officials ‚Äî Patrick Kennedy, undersecretary for management; Joyce Anne Barr, assistant secretary of state for administration; Michele Bond, assistant secretary of state for consular affairs; and Gentry Smith, director of the Office of Foreign Missions ‚Äî had already submitted a letter of resignation, which was formally accepted this week. Acting State Department spokesman Mark Toner noted in a statement to the media Thursday that the ‚Äúposts are political appointments‚Äù that require the president‚Äôs nomination and the Senate‚Äôs confirmation. ‚ÄúThey are not career appointments but of limited term,‚Äù Toner said. ‚ÄúOf the officers whose resignations were accepted, some will continue in the Foreign Service in other positions, and others will retire by choice or because they have exceeded the time limits of their grade in service. No officer accepts a political appointment with the expectation that it is unlimited. And all officers understand that the President may choose to replace them at any time.‚Äù He added that each officer had ‚Äúserved admirably and well‚Äù and described their departure as ‚Äúa moment to consider their accomplishments and thank them for their service.‚Äù Read more here " False link

In an interview taped with Fox News‚Äô Sean Hannity on Thursday morning, Trump said he ‚Äúwould‚Äù encourage McConnell to kill the 60-vote threshold on nominees to the high court. ‚ÄúI would. We have obstructionists,‚Äù Trump said, dinging Democrats for delaying the confirmations of Sen. Jeff Sessions as attorney general and Mike Pompeo as CIA director. ‚ÄúWhy are they doing that?‚Äù McConnell and his deputies have signaled they will do whatever it takes to confirm a Supreme Court nominee after blocking former President Barack Obama from filling the seat for nearly a year.

The bulk of the party has settled on a scorched-earth, not-now-not-ever model of opposition. In legislative proposals, campaign promises, donor pitches and even in some Senate hearings, Democrats have opted for a hard-line, give-no-quarter posture, a reflection of a seething party base that will have it no other way. According to interviews with roughly two dozen party leaders and elected officeholders, the internal debate over whether to take the conciliatory path ‚Äî to pursue a high-road approach as a contrast to Trump‚Äôs deeply polarizing and norm-violating style ‚Äî is largely settled, cemented in place by a transition and first week in office that has confirmed the left‚Äôs worst fears about Trump‚Äôs temperament. ‚ÄúThey were entitled to a grace period, but it was midnight the night of the inauguration to 8 o'clock the next morning, when the administration sent out people to lie about numerous significant things. And the damage to the credibility of the presidency has already been profound,‚Äù said Washington Gov. Jay Inslee. ‚ÄúThey were entitled to a grace period and they blew it. It‚Äôs been worse than I could have imagined, the first few days.‚Äú Read more here " False link
