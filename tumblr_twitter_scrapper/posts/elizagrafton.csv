No. No we don‚Äôt know about it.¬† Americans aren‚Äôt told this shit.¬† The only thing we‚Äôre taught about any Middle Eastern country in school is that 1) the region exists 2) it‚Äôs where The War is happening and 3) Muslim people live there. That‚Äôs it. Maybe if you‚Äôre lucky you‚Äôll get into the Hammurabi Code and some early Babylonian stuff but American schools seem to think that if it happened outside Europe and before the colonial period, or makes America look bad and isn‚Äôt about A Very Watered Down Version of What Slavery Was, it‚Äôs not important. Info on this is almost notoriously hard to find. It‚Äôs not in any texts on American and Russian involvement in the Middle East during the Cold War that I can find. You have to specifically look for a book about the Shah‚Äôs return to power, and even then you‚Äôd be hard pressed to find a book like that at your local bookstore. Once you get into some higher level college courses you might know about it, but the people who can afford those are more likely to already be indoctrinated into a certain Way of Thinking (read: they‚Äôre racist as shit) by the time they get there. And it‚Äôs almost like you have to know about it beforehand if you want to find information on it. The only reason I knew about it is because there‚Äôs a thirty second summary of the event in Persepolis. Those thirty seconds flipped my entire worldview.  ‚ÄúAll the Shah‚Äôs Men‚Äù by Stephen Kinzer is a good, accessible text for people who want to know more about this.  !!!  I had to explain literally this to one of my co-workers, who is so fuckin racist against Middle Eastern people it‚Äôs insane.  She‚Äôs 60. She never heard of this.  As I was explaining this and how, during the Regan years, we funded Osama Bin Laden to fight against Russia, leading to the destruction of much of the infrastructure in the region, one of the plant workers came in to get his badge fixed.  He works in the quality control lab. He served 15 years active duty in the Army. Super smart guy, has a masters in chemistry and another masters in biology, raises saltwater fish¬†in¬†his spare time for sale, has the saltwater aquarium setup of the gods. ¬†Raises rare corals too, some of which he donates to be used in re-seeding reefs around the world, but that‚Äôs a side tangent.  And he listened for a minute, then nodded and said ‚ÄúYeah. I was there during that. I helped train people to fight. They wanted us to help them build schools and hospitals, after, but we were only interested in them as cannon fodder. Left the whole area in ruins. I wasn‚Äôt surprised when they hated us for it later. Told people then it would happen. We let them know then that they were only valuable to America as expendable bodies. Why wouldn‚Äôt they resent us for that?‚Äù And she just looked floored.  ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶‚Äù She started, after a few minutes. ‚ÄúWhat do you think of Trump?‚Äù ‚ÄúI hate him. He‚Äôs a coward and he‚Äôs going to get good people killed.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt even blink. ‚Äú She looked back and forth between us for a second, and then asked how I knew all this.  ‚ÄúI research things.‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúGoogle is great.‚Äù He nodded enthusiastically.  And she just sat there for a second and then said, really quietly, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know.‚Äù  She lived through it.  American schools don‚Äôt teach you any of this sort of thing.  " False text

ALL of the girls in the class raised their hands. none of the boys did. when he asked who didn‚Äôt hate taylor all of the men raised their hands. and me and my friend started laughing because of COURSE they did. and my prof was like why are you laughing and the writer was like¬†‚Äúi think they‚Äôre laughing at the gender difference in that answer‚Äù and my prof was like¬†‚Äúwell, from my male perspective, i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôm being sexist‚Äù WHAT. first of all did you hear that sentence at ALL do you understand how paradoxical it is????? second of all, no. just no. and then my prof went on to say¬†‚Äúi feel like we need to see taylor be horrible. like bad solution, he kicks a dog‚Äù evidently a man can abuse and rape a girl and not be hated, but if he kicks a dog then he‚Äôs PURE EVIL and THAT is exactly what‚Äôs wrong with our society   " False text

Because that is bullshit.   WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK  I have food stamps in a different state and this list is essentially my grocery just when I go to the store. These are easy to prepare, quick, filling meals and most of them have a long shelf life and can be stored for emergencies or of you use up your food stamps before the end of the month.

When I have money, I buy things in bulk for when I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶I just‚Ä¶what?!  How the hell do you make it illegal for poor people to buy food? This is so wrong and disgusting.  Given the number of extremely cheap items on the list it looks like a way to discourage people from even using food stamps and either scraping together money for food somehow, or relying on private charities. Is there any single fund or movement to supply food banks in Wisconsin with food specifically from that list in large amounts? ¬†  THIS IS BLATANT CLASS WARFARE AND EVERY DECENT HUMAN BEING SHOULD BE DISGUSTED BY IT.

A 17 year old girl in Korea was kicking ass in Overwatch (made it the eighth in the world) and two pro gamers accused her of hacking. So what did she do? Fucking proved them wrong. She demonstrated her skill on a live stream of a popular Korean streamer to show there was no cheating involved.¬† SHE WAS JUST THAT GOOD It‚Äôs sad that she felt she had to wear a mask to hide her identity during the stream because she was afraid she would be targeted for online bullying. She even gets emotional at the end of the stream because this accusation had weighed so heavily on her. The two¬†‚Äúpro gamers‚Äù even threatened to quit playing if she was proved to be legit, but Blizzard stood behind her and let those two idiots walk away. I may not play Overwatch, but I know if there was a girl who did this in League, CS:GO, or any other online game she would be accused of the same thing. Now I don‚Äôt usually post original content, but this is HUGE for online gaming. No one even batted an eye when Rekkles (Fnatic Marksman in LOL) started in the Pro League of Legends scene at 17,but this girl was targeted as a hacker. For Blizzard to stand behind her is an amazing development in the online gaming community and I hope everyone supports her whether they play Overwatch or not.¬† Good Job Blizzard.

The alt-weekly Cleveland Scene‚Äôs report revolves around the concept of the ‚Äúno-bill,‚Äù which is the name for a grand jury‚Äôs formal decision‚Äîarrived at by voting‚Äînot to bring charges in a given case. (The opposite of a ‚Äúno-bill‚Äù is a ‚Äútrue bill,‚Äù i.e. a decision to indict.) When Cuyahoga County prosecutor Timothy McGinty announced on Dec. 28 that officers Timothy Loehmann and Frank Garmback would not be charged in Rice‚Äôs death, he said only that the grand jury ‚Äúdeclined to indict‚Äù the officers, leading many observers to assume that a no-bill had been voted on. But the Cleveland Scene‚Äôs reporters could find no documentation of such a decision, and a spokesman for the Cuyahoga prosecutor‚Äôs office responded to the publication‚Äôs queries by saying that there had been no vote.  Two area law professors told the Scene they had never heard of a grand jury behaving in such a way. What‚Äôs more, reporters were unable to find any official documentation in the Cleveland court system of the grand jury having concluded its business: We were then directed to the Cuyahoga County grand jury office. Wednesday morning, a clerk there told Scene that the ‚Äúmysterious document‚Äù may or may not exist and that, even if it does, it could only be provided to us via court order by Administrative and Presiding Judge John J. Russo ‚Ä¶ Russo, who spoke to Scene by phone, professed to be as confused as we were. ‚ÄúWhen you say ‚Äòdocument,‚Äô I‚Äôm not sure what you mean. I don‚Äôt know what that is. It‚Äôs either a true bill or a no bill,‚Äù he said.But actually, no. His staff determined Wednesday that a ‚Äúno-bill‚Äù had never been filed. What any of this means for Rice‚Äôs case is unclear. A lawyer representing the Rice family said the lack of a no-bill could constitute another indication that McGinty‚Äîwho formally recommended against indicting Loehmann and Garmback and presented expert reports to the grand jury that backed up his recommendation‚Äîhad not taken the idea of prosecution seriously. A federal investigation into Rice‚Äôs death is reportedly ongoing; Rice‚Äôs family has also filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the officers involved.  Oh hell no  ‚Ä¶  so everyone still lies. They are just going to lie. Lie lie lie.  Here‚Äôs a link to the Cleveland Scene article. It has an update with an image of the ~document that the Prosecutor‚Äôs Office eventually produced. It has the same¬†‚Äúdeclined to issue criminal charges‚Äù language, and doesn‚Äôt say how this decision was reached. Also, apparently the Grand Jury has to ask for the opportunity to do true bill-no bill vote if they disagree with assessment of the County Prosecutor‚Äôs Office on whether there‚Äôs sufficient evidence to charge the officer.
