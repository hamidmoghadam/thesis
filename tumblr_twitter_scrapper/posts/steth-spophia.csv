(yes, it exists. in large multitude.)even if you ship him in a healthy relationship with another boy, you are still derailing our preexisting canon representation - you are proving that you do not view taako‚Äôs canonical relationship with kravitz as a relationship, but as a ship. something interpretational. something¬†‚Äòoptional‚Äô that you can choose to support based on whether you¬†‚Äòlike‚Äô it or not. we are more than that. our representation is worth more than that.shipping was literally invented to fetishize gay men - it started with star trek, when non-gay men would create zines featuring porn of the actors who played the characters. shipping has always been something hypothetical, something ‚Äòfun‚Äô for non-gay men to partake in. we do not exist to be your fun, your hobby, your entertainment.¬†not only is this hurting gay men, but the oversaturation of fetishistic m/m content is overpowering the w/w content in the fandom, and giving less space for lesbians to express and enjoy their representation in the show.¬†you are putting your fun above our lives, our safety and our happiness. shipping has been viewed as harmless fun for decades now, and even if my viewpoint is a new one that you will view as¬†‚Äòirrational‚Äô, it is still an important one, and i want to make a change in fandoms for the better. i am not just inventing problems where there are none. this is important to me, and to others. so remember this: when shipping exists to increase gay representation, it is good and should be supported. but if you‚Äôre shipping just to have fun with gay men? you need to reconsider how important your ‚Äòfun‚Äô really is."
