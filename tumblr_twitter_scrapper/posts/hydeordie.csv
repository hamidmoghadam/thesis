hydeordie 153278437171 "2016-11-17 00:00:27 GMT" http://hydeordie.com/post/153278437171/donnerpartyofone-clarabeau-ive-seen-lots-of "donnerpartyofone:  clarabeau:  I’ve seen lots of urging to call your representative and lots of evidence that calling your representative is the most effective way to make your congresspeople notice you’re all worked up. Like: “Congressional offices tally every issue that people in their district contact them about. It’s not uncommon for a leader to support a bill after as few as 7-10 people call in support of it. With a 30-second call you can instantly get a bill/issue viewed by your leader.” Now that I hear this I totally get it, imagine your phone ringing ten times in one afternoon about the same exact thing!! Phone communication of any kind Disrupts my Day and if I got like a dozen incoming calls tops I would be complaining about the event which caused these calls for probably weeks. All that being said, once I talked myself into calling my reps because it is important and the least I could do, I had a hard time finding ideas for natural-sounding phone scripts online?? This shocks me as an internet person and also as person who gets clammy hands before all phone conversations up to and including ordering a pizza. So I spent an hour today drafting a thing which I mostly Frankenstein’d from @under-the-observatory‘s awesome letter, then I spent twenty minutes staring at my phone and convincing myself it would be fine to call tomorrow. But this is what I did (eventually) use to call John McCain’s local and DC offices today, then I altered it a bit and called my other congressmen as well.  Hi, my name is ___, I’m calling today as a constituent in ___ County to urge Senator McCain to publicly criticize the appointment of Stephen Bannon as chief strategist. This is actually my first time calling my representative, but I am a proud third-generation Arizonan. Though I am a registered Democrat, I have great respect for Senator McCain, not only for his service to our country, but for taking a principled stance against the ugly rhetoric of this election cycle, even at the risk to his career. And so I feel I can reach out to him and say that I am extremely concerned that people from the alt-right like Stephen Bannon, with known ties to white supremacy, now have a voice in the White House. I know many Republicans close to me are keen to shield the positives they see in Trump’s Republican platform from accusations of racism, anti-semitism, and sexism. I hope that, as a conservative voice, Senator McCain will take the principled stance again and publicly speak out against this appointment. It would make a huge difference in bridging the gap we’re all talking about and building confidence, for your Republican constituents and those of us across the aisle. Thank you so much for hearing me.  The staff were nice and there was barely any other conversation required except their assurances that they would pass my message to the senator!  I did some research on calling your rep and here’s what I found: -You want to give the thesis statement of who you are, why you’re calling, and what you want to happen clearly, in the first sentence, because this is what the staffers will pass on in their call report. Then you give a personal story about what your specific concerns are. I don’t know what this part does as much; I imagine it might be the thing a staffer talks about around the water cooler, or considers late at night when wondering what the other side is thinking, I don’t know. I just wanted my narrative to be that the appointment of Stephen Bannon, Literal Fuck Chump, actually made me call my representative for the first time, and told myself that my slightly shaky 12-year-old phone voice would underline this thirty second exchange as a monumental virgin voyage of great significance from me, a Millenial Constituent. (Again this is literally the least I can do but it felt slightly intimidating to me, which is sad, and I look forward to a time when I’ve done it so much that I no longer feel nervous about it.) -I’m all about offering some sort of olive branch because it is my nature but more importantly because these staffers are not Democrats and I would imagine some of these things I am saying about my “Republican friends” are anxieties they, too, might have, as human beings.  Questions I still have: what is the right balance to hit in this kind of communication? Do I want to sound like an extremely informed person reading a script or a concerned citizen casually speaking their thoughts or something in between? What’s the right length for a call like this? How often should/can I make these calls before I cross into the territory of annoying staffers/no longer doing good? I’ve heard it’s better to call the local office rather than the DC office; is this true? If anyone with more experience doing this kind of thing can offer more tips or better yet MORE SCRIPTS, me and my crippling social anxiety would so much appreciate it. Here’s an easy way to find out who to call. Here’s the Twitter storm everyone’s read already on how effective calling your rep is, with some additions.   if you are like me, which is the kind of person who would rather eat their phone than answer a phone call, you may find this very helpful! please reblog with tips and scripts if you have them!  Important advice." False text

Using found sticks and blades of grass to apply paint to the paper as well as site-specific botanical elements like berries and flowers, Simonini creates abstract, psychological landscapes with a similar energy to 1920s Fauvism and Surrealism. Simonini continues an experimentation with constrained gesture by giving himself the challenge of painting with his non-dominant hand and even both of his feet. This loss of control facilitates an exploratory process wherein Simonini develops errant marks into figures emerging out of an intuitive chaos. via…Seriously, someone tell me because this is some next level art trolling right here."
