We’ll be accepting them between Dec 1st, 2016 and Jan 1st, 2017. The full list of anthology participants will be announced Jan 15th, except in the instance we receive more submissions than expected, in which case this may be extended 1 week to accommodate volume. WHAT IS IT? Tim'rous Beastie is a black-and-white comic anthology about small lives in a big, big world. This is an anthology by and for those of us who grew up inspired by Redwall, The Deptford Mice, Rats of NIMH, and other tales of brave and imperiled critters defying their size and place in the natural order. We want to not only channel that inspiration into the medium of comics, but to approach familiar themes with fresh eyes. Featuring fantasy, urban fantasy, and sci-fi, Tim'rous Beastie aims to explore the potential of stories told from a scale that, while still very human, makes even the mundane aspects of human life seem gigantic. The anthology’s title is Scots for “timid little beast,” and from a line the 1785 Robert Burns poem, “To a Mouse, on Turning Her Up in Her Nest with the Plough (link),” which is also where the phrase “the best laid plans of mice and men” originates. Tim’rous Beastie will be a joint venture, with Amanda Lafrenais as Managing Editor and Iron Circus Comics publishing and distributing. PARTICIPANTS The following creators are currently slated to appear in Tim’rous Beastie.    Evan Dahm  Abby Howard and Elias Brunt KC Green  Sloane Leong C. Spike Trotman and Amanda Lafrenais WHAT WE WANT Stories of all genres – adventure, romance, horror, etc – about the lives of anthropomorphic intelligent animals. The acceptable level of anthropomorphism ranges from giving voices to realistic animals in their natural habitats to “civilized” creatures who wear pants, build homes, cook meals, and soforth. However, all the animals featured in creator submissions should be depicted in realistic scale with one another. Mice should be mouse-sized, cats cat-sized, and so on. Think Mouse Guard, not Mickey Mouse. WHAT WE DON’T WANT Pin-ups and prose submissions. This anthology will exclusively feature comics. Excessively graphic content. Like the books that inspired this anthology, we welcome darker themes, however they must be equivalent to a PG-13 movie rating. No profanity, nudity, erotica, or gore. Proposals from incomplete creative teams. If you’re an artist without a writer, or a writer without an artist, please find a partner before submitting your proposal. Fanfic, fan art, or pastiche. Please don’t submit stories using intellectual property you don’t own, or stories that are clearly referential of such work/take place in the same universe or reality. Racist/xenophobic allegory. Tim'rous Beastie will not accept stories that generalize or caricature entire species of animals as the equivalents of or stand-ins for human races or ethnic groups. We would also prefer it if submitted stories avoided the cliche of rats, weasels, snakes, and similar animals being inherently evil by design, and mice or bunnies as inherently good. Cute mice vs. The World. We won’t reject submissions with mice as protagonists, but we urge you to put more thought and originality into your stories than Cute Mouse Protagonist vs. Irredeemably Evil Whatever. Examples Some existing media that inspired or captures the spirit of Tim'rous Beastie: Redwall series The Mouse Guard The Deptford Mice trilogy  Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH ( The Secret of NIMH ) Watership Down The Plague Dogs The works of Beatrix Potter Payment Tim’rous Beastie will pay a $50 page rate, plus ten contributor’s copies per creator and the perpetual right to buy copies of the anthology for 50% off the cover price for as long as the comic is in print. There will also be a bonus for all contributors if the Kickstarter campaign does well. Creators’ Rights Creators submit stories to Tim’rous Beastie with the understanding that, if accepted, they are ceding exclusive first worldwide rights to the story for a full calendar year from the date of publication, and non-exclusive worldwide reprint rights in perpetuity. Intellectual property rights will remain in the hands of the creator. We don’t want your characters or concepts, just your comics. Production Size If your proposal is accepted, the final art must be designed to fit standard American graphic novel dimensions: 6.625"" × 10.25"". What this means for your production process depends on your choice of medium, but the following guides may be useful. quick guide for 11"" × 17"" bristol full guide for 11"" × 17"" bristol quick guide for digital art Photoshop template Manga Studio template For more information, consult Blambot’s page on the subject. Contacting Us If you have any questions about this project which have not been addressed here, you can contact us at amandalafrenais@gmail.com or send a tumblr ask. Please read this page, including the FAQ, in its entirety before emailing us or sending a Tumblr ask. Thank you! FAQ Can my submission be grayscale? Or does “black and white” MEAN black and white? Grayscale is just fine! Can people outside the United States submit to this anthology? Absolutely! I am under 18 and/or will be turning 18 when the book comes out, can I submit? No. For legal reasons we are only accepting submissions from people who are 18+ at the time of submission. Can I submit more than one story proposal? Yes, but please, try to keep the total number of stories you submit low, maybe to a maximum of three. We want your best ideas, not every single idea you have! When will you need the finished pages by? TBA. Can my story have humans? Humans may be alluded to or depicted as part of the world building, as in they can have an impact on the world the characters live in, but they themselves cannot be characters. This means small Beasties can have things like sardine can beds, teacup bathtubs, and framed postage stamps on their walls. Humans can also have an impact on the plot, much like in “Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH” wherein the events of the story are necessitated by the actions of the human farmers. But submitted stories cannot star these humans. Can I make my submission about a non-existent fantasy creature? No. While fantasy elements are allowed (magic, sorcery, the occult, etc), animals must represent real-world counterparts. >> For more previously answered questions, click here. <<  The latest Iron Circus Comics anthology is now accepting submissions!

Artists write things to attach to their work for a reason, removing all context and anything else they put up is not okay just for your blog’s aesthetic (or worse because you want to write in something else hyping your own blog). Seriously it hurts my heart every time I see someone do this to not only my art, but my friends, and my peers. For a number of freelance artists (like myself), taking off the context/links could mean less sales and messing up their potential to attract clients easily to various sites. We are often our own agents, our own social media runners, and our own hype-men. It is a full time job and you are making it harder for us. If you love our art, do not take down what we write on our own work. " False text

It’s simple & fun!  Sketchup is incredibly helpful. I can’t recommend it enough. There’s a 3D model warehouse where you can download all kinds of stuff so you don’t have to build everything from scratch.  reblog to save a life  This is an incomplete tutorial, and it drives me crazy every time I see it come around.  We live in a pretty great digital age and we have access to a ton of amazing tools that artists in past generations couldn’t even dream of, but a lot of people look at a cool trick and only learn half of the process of using it.  Here’s the missing part of this tutorial: How do you populate your backgrounds?  Well, here’s the answer: If the focus is the environment, you must show a person in relation to that environment. The examples above are great because they show how to use the software itself, but each one just kind of “plops” the character in front of their finished product with no regard of the person’s relation to their environment. How do you fix this?  Well, here’s the simplest solution: This is a popular trick used by professional storyboard and comic artists alike when they’re quickly planning compositions. It’s simple and it requires you to do some planning before you sit down to crank out that polished, final version of your work, but it will be the difference between a background and an environment. From Blacksad (artist: Juanjo Guarnido) From Hellboy (Mike Mignola) Even if your draftsmanship isn’t that great (like mine), people can be more immersed in the story you tell if you just make it feel like there is a world that exists completely separate from the one in which they currently reside – not just making a backdrop the characters stand in front of. Your creations live in a unique world, and it is as much a character as any other member of the cast. Make it as believable as they are.  Great comments and tutorials! I’m a 3d artist and have been exploring the possibilities of using 3d as reference for 2d poses. I want to add a couple of tips and things! Sketchup is very useful for environment references, and I assume it’s reasonably easy to learn. If you’re interested in going above and beyond, I highly recommend learning a proper 3d modeling program to help with art, especially because you can very easily populate a scene or location with characters! Using 3ds Max I can pretty quickly construct an environment for reference. But going beyond that, I can also pose a pretty simple ‘CAT’ armature (known in 3d as a rig) straight into the scene, which can be totally customized, from various limbs, tails, wings, whatever, to proportions, and also can be modeled onto and expanded upon (for an example, you could 3d sculpt a head reference for your character and then attach it to the CAT rig, so you have a reference for complex face angles!) The armature can also be posed incredibly easily. I know programs exist for stuff like this - Manga Studio, Design Doll - but posing characters in these programs is always an exercise in frustration and very fiddly imo. A simple 3d rig is impossibly easy to pose. By creating an environment and dropping my character rig into it, I have an excellent point of reference when it comes to drawing the scene! Not only that, but I can also view the scene from whatever angle I could ever want or need, including the character and their pose/position relative to the environment. We can even quickly and easily expand this scene to include more characters! Proper 3d modeling software is immensely powerful, and if you wanted to, you could model a complex environment that occurs regularly in your comic or illustration work (say, a castle interior, or an outdoor forest environment) and populate the scene with as many perspective-grounded characters as you need!

There’s no real tutorials on different features, and when I find a reference I’m terrified that I’m going to make them look too stereotypical. Even trying to do the color work for my dad’s skin (dark Latino) makes me nervous because 1) there’s very little information on how to make the skin tone look like something other than burnt Sienna orange, and 2) at what point does a race study look offensive? I wanted to make a villain in an old RP dark skinned, but I was afraid that making a Villain dark would be racist. As someone who draws and paints digitally, I NEED this feed back. I’m not trying to be offensive, and I’m not going to argue with constructive criticism , so please, PLEASE, offer advice to people on drawing PoC because there is a horrible lack of instruction out there.  HELLO FRIENDS! A buddy of mind directed me to this post. As someone who has lived with this same fear I want you to know that it’s normal for a lot of folks. I actually had this fear before Tumblr. It’s not something that sprung up from the internet only. Steven Universe is actually the show that opened me up more to different ways of expressing a characters race presentation (I was still a bit timid about it before) and I’m very, very, very grateful for that. It’s also how I ended up drawing this little cutie: Now, moving along, let me hand ya’ll some tutorials to see if they’ll help you out a bit. First up is my all time fave skin tutorial. I love this one because of the range and the palettes. Part 1 Part 2 Supplemental Color Chart A Tutorial for all kinds of hair! Part 1  Have a chart of 14 different Asian eye shapes.   A tutorial on dreadlocks.   Littlefroggies has a couple of lovely brush sets for Manga Studio 5 that depict afro textured hair as well as braids.    Draw from life. Look at references images and try to emulate how people look.   Celebrities categorized by ethnicity. This can be useful to you for reference. And some more faces. And more faces. And more faces. Here’s a resource list.   Also mulattafury covers a really, really good aspect of this in this ask here. Remember that you’re drawing a person and people come in a wide, wide variety of forms, colors, shapes and sizes. There is no cookie cutter mold for race. The recent Blackout days are amazing proof of this. Look at the variety! Appreciate how beautiful human beings are! Want more “real” people instead of celebrities or models to work from? OH MAN DO I HAVE THE TUMBLR BLOG FOR YOU. Now on first loading it as of right now you will see a lot of pale folks. Scroll down though. You’ll see more variety as you go through. See? Also please remember that darker skinned folks can have lighter eyes! And that not all people that ID as a race that you would normally think of as having darker skin have dark skin. Remember, variety is endless! There are so, so, so many resources out there! It just takes a bit of digging to find them. Can I guarantee that you will NEVER be called racist for drawing people that are not white? No. But generally? You’re going to be called out as racist more if you only draw people that are white. Something interesting to me is that folks that told me that my work could be seen as racist in the past? Were all white people. And I’m not even talking about drawing racial stereotypes. I’m talking about just having a dark skinned character. For some reason, the mere act of drawing someone who was not white seemed to make them think that it was racist. I had a customer give me a blank slate for drawing characters once. One of them was black. They asked me to change it to “avoid the race issue”. Which…isn’t how that works. Try things. Practice. Draw stuff. And hell, put in a disclaimer, make a note, tell people “I am still learning, if something seems off please tell me! I’ll work to fix it!” If you tell people that you’re trying? They’re generally more than happy to help and will understand that it’s not intentional. Focus on drawing people, not race. Focus on how this models lip does that thing or how their nose curves just so. Think about how you can simplify and apply it. Generally you’re not going to end up with gross racial caricatures. You know why? Because most gross racial caricatures? Don’t even look like real people. Let’s look at Looney Tunes for a sec: I showed this to one of my friends who is younger and she said “Is that supposed to be a person?” Racist caricatures really blow shit way horribly out of proportion. When it comes to the white washing aspect? I have two big suggestions to avoid that. 1) COLOR CHECK. If you are drawing someone or you are drawing a character and they are dark skinned? Check multiple image sources for the character to make sure you have the skin tone correct. That’s all you gotta do. Make sure it’s the right color. If you’re working from a real person’s photo I suggest choosing a mid tone from their face to start with. Also keep your reference image handy. 2) If you’re doing a character yourself? Consider how dark you would like this character to be. Have you tried making a darker skinned character? Why not? Try it out and see how it goes. (I’m not saying that you HAVE to make dark skinned characters but consider it in your process. You have a whole box of crayons to color with, why do you keep using the same one?) Also if you make characters treat them like people, not stereotypes. That’s pretty much all I got on the matter. Remember, if you fuck up sometimes? That’s okay. It’s how you react that defines you. There was a really, really popular artist (shoomlah here on tumblr) who was doing historically accurate Disney princesses awhile back that misrepresented Pocahontas. Folks called her out on it and she acknowledged she made a mistake and she actually redid the piece, getting help from folks in the know to make it more accurate. Here are the original and more accurate versions. She’s stated that this incident made her a more thoughtful artist. So there you go! Refs, tuts, thoughts, and advice! Enjoy!  Ran this by one of my buddies, captain-naro and he added this: “I’ve noticed that drawing POC is something that is going against the norm a little bit. And it seems to be less normal to have a POC existing in an art piece than it is to have a POC existing in the world. When there are many.”   “It only becomes a race issue when you portray them in a way that sparks a race issue” “Honestly what it seems like to me is. Everyone has an ideal look for their character whether it is because they want that character to look the most attractive or whatever and that ideal is usually a white person.Thanks to Tumblr and progression being a thing it is not as bad as it was but it still is there and blatant to me. To most people, white people are the most appealing thing to draw for a protagonist or anything like that whereas a black character would fill the role of a background character or an enemy and pretty much any other race would be some other kind of “exotic” trope or something. But that’s probably going more into story writing and not art.”  Going to share this over here as well because I wrote up a huge advice and resource thing in it and maybe some of my followers here can use it too.

I have seen unauthorized copies of my work all over the place including on Amazon, Etsy, clip art sites, T-shirt vendors like Sunfrog and Teespring… and so far I have been successful in getting these images taken down fairly quickly. A few months ago, a friend noticed this kid’s shirt at kohls.com  The boston terrier images on the t-shirt are badly traced copies of my Boogie Doggie Language drawings. Small details like eyes and ears have been changed, bow ties and glasses have been added, and most of the images are flipped. (Examples below have been re-flipped to clarify the similarities) According to my attorney, the legal team at Iconix (the parent company of Mudd) does not believe there is any copyright infringement. They are refusing to take any action or compensate me in any way without a lawsuit. If I want them to stop selling this t-shirt or to get any money back from their sales, I have to sue them. Litigation may not be a big deal to a large company like Iconix/Mudd; but it would be ridiculously expensive for a solo artist like me. Costs could go up to $60K if the case goes all the way to trial. I cannot claim statutory damages ($150K per infringing item) because my copyright registration was not completed within 3 months of when Doggie Language was first published.  If I win the case, I will recoup revenue from Mudd’s sales and my attorney fees, but this may not be enough to cover all the other thousands of dollars worth of court fees including expert witness fees. I basically have to pay out of pocket if I want to sue.  Many friends and supporters have suggested a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for a lawsuit. I am very touched by the offer but I have to say I feel uncomfortable about taking money from other people.  I already had in mind a crowdfunding campaign for my Dogs of The World book project later this year or next year, and if I were to request donations now to cover legal fees, I feel that I would be overimposing on people by asking for money twice and I don’t feel good about this. I would rather that people donate to my creative projects than fight this stupid expensive battle to prove that the copied images are mine. Also - I worry about not raising enough money or not achieving the resolution that all my contributors are hoping for. Taking money from other people = extra pressure.  I have not yet decided what I am going to do; these are just some of the concerns I have right now. For now, this is HOW YOU CAN HELP: 1. Please SHARE this information. Tell people about this bootleg t-shirt at Kohl’s and Mudd’s response, and spread awareness about the larger issue of fashion retailers stealing and profiting from indie artists and getting away with it. Use Facebook, Twitter, and other social media. (my original tweet here and my facebook post here)2. Boycott these companies. Write to these companies to let them know you will not buy from them. Pressure Kohl’s to sever their relationship with Mudd/Iconix. Twitter - @kohls @muddstyle​ @iconix https://www.iconixbrand.com/connect/ 3. Buy directly from artists if you can. I am going to be making a similar Boston Terrier shirt available soon, for anyone who is interested. 4. If you are purchasing artwork online (like stock images, clip art etc), check the source carefully. I have seen copies of my artwork on sites like istockphoto and freepik and had to have them taken down.  If you are a vendor/designer who buys stock imagery from these sites, be aware that ANYONE can upload images to these licensing agencies/libraries and lie that the work is theirs. (yes, it sucks) IF YOU ARE AN ARTIST or DESIGNER:1. Learn from my mistakes. When you create new artwork, register your copyright within 90 days of publication.  You can do this online. Without copyright registration you have no leverage in court, and an attorney is less likely to work on contingency. Here is an illustrated summary of how copyright registration protects you. I did not know about the 90-day registration window and I don’t think many people do. If you registered within the 90 day period, and if your copyrights are violated, you can collect statutory damages in court ($150K per item)  regardless of whether the infringing party made any money from your work. If your copyright registration is too late (as mine was for Doggie Language), you can only recover their profits & your attorney’s fees - and this may or may not be enough to cover all other expensive court fees. If the infringing party can prove that they made no money from sales, then the artist gets nothing. 2. When you look to other artists’ works for inspiration (as we all do and this is normal), make sure that what you create is not a recognizable copy of what you are looking at. Tracing someone else’s work, changing colors or a few details here and there, or flipping the image 180 degrees is STILL plagiarism and copyright infringement. Another example is taking the “head” from someone’s drawing of a dog, and sticking it on a different body - this is STILL copyright infringement. I want to say thank you again to everyone who is supporting me. There are times I find myself feeling depressed, insignificant, and powerless, and your passionate support really helps! Thank you for standing by me! Also thank you to: - Robynne Raye for her help and advice. Details about Robynne’s/Modern Dog’s copyright infringement case against Target and Disney HERE and HERE. They won! - Megan Wilson for organizing this petition: https://www.change.org/p/mudd-stop-stealing-the-work-of-independent-artists  Please sign if you can. - Lili 7/24/2016 UPDATE THANK YOU TO EVERYONE for the signatures, reposts and retweets! There is power and justice with social media group effort: Kohl’s has removed the shirt from their website!!! We have yet to check if the shirt has been removed from physical stores. No response from Mudd/Iconix, but this is a big step!  8/8/2016 UPDATE Kohl’s now claims the shirt design is not infringement (their “design team” created it) and they are going to continue selling the shirt. It appears that another item in the Kohl’s catalog has an unauthorized copy of my Boogie design on it. Sonoma is a Kohl’s in-house brand. These socks are selling in their stores and on their website. This boston terrier is lifted from the SAME “Doggie Language” poster probably by their same in-house “designer”. And they are still denying copyright infringement and are refusing to stop selling these products!   #boycottkohls PLEASE READ and SHARE MY NEW BLOG POST about Derivative Works  here: http://blog.doggiedrawings.net/post/148161295271  And this is as good a reason as any why so many artists might never ever share their art online again. Companies who allow their in-house designers to just rip off and ‘change’ art they found on the Internet are LOW. The majority of the designers are freelance, it would take little effort to just hire the artists who CREATED THE CONTENT in the first place. Likewise, company designers who have zero qualms in ripping off the work of a fellow artist: take a long hard look at your life and ask, what if it happened to you? It’s sadly a horrible Catch-22. People absolutely DO get hired for jobs like this based on their online art posts, it’s happened for me quite a few times, now. But post your art online, there’s the awful risk of mass reposting-without-credit, etsy theft or wholesale corporate plagiarism as seen here. I wish I could give a safe answer. All I have is: watermark everything CLEARLY with a portfolio URL or an email address. " False text

You heard that right. Yes, we’re talking about that PETA: People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. The theft was caught on video, and has been reported by WAVY.com, local media in Accomack County, Virginia. County Sheriff Todd Godwin insists that he charged the two PETA workers with larceny. The prosecutor has apparently refused to pursue the case, however, citing insufficient evidence of “criminal intent.” Let’s try to comprehend this: we have a home surveillance video clearly demonstrating that a van marked “PETA” pulled up to the house of Wilbur Cerate, and that someone took the family’s chihuahua, Maya. PETA has reportedly admitted that Maya was killed: they arrived later with a basket of fruit as compensation, says Maya’s owner. (For some bizarre reason, PETA thinks that a nice basket of food makes killing pets okay.) Hence, we have what we are told is pretty strong evidence that a crime was committed. An admission of guilt has been alleged. What part of the notion “criminal intent” am I missing here? We also seem to have powerful evidence that the girl who owned Maya is inconsolable. The New York Daily News reports:  The Mexican immigrant said the tiny dog had been the only thing that cheered his daughter, who was having difficulty adjusting to her new country.  PETA has refused to comment. Local reporter Anita Blanton has tried valiantly to elicit a statement from PETA headquarters in Norfolk, Virginia, and has thus far had no luck. It’s hard to believe, but People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has a long history of this kind of abuse. You’ll find it documented in ugly detail here: “Shocking Photos: PETA’s Secret Slaughter of Kittens, Puppies.” Even more difficult to believe is that they tend to get away with it. In 2005, PETA employees killed numerous healthy dogs and cats in the back of their van, and deposited the bodies in a dumpster behind a mall. They were charged with“21 felony counts each of animal cruelty,” but were convicted only of “littering.” The littering conviction was later overturned. PETA has very good lawyers. “Essentially, the littering charges against Adria Hinkle and Andrew Cook were overturned because the prosecution failed to prove that a dumpster is not the proper place for trash.” (“Trash” here being dead pets.) Since then PETA has been careful to dispose of bodies legally, using a professional crematorium. (They have killed over 29,000 animals.) But they are not being careful enough, it seems, when it comes to rounding up neighborhood animals. PETA are keen on eradicating strays — in particular, they urge the mass killing of feral cats — but they do not have permission to grab a family’s pet dog from their home. Clearly they did not expect that the Cerate house would have a surveillance camera.   WHAT YOU CAN DO PETA would prefer that people not keep animals for their amusement. If you personally find this unacceptable, however — the alleged theft and destruction of a family dog — then please let the local prosecutor know how you feel. Yes, PETA has a huge budget, and powerful lawyers, but public outrage can be effective. The Commonwealth Attorney’s name is Gary Agar. His office number is 757-787-2877; the office email is commatt@verizon.net. You can also make your displeasure known to The Sam Simon Foundation. Sam Simon, co-creator of The Simpsons, has long done wonderful work for animals, and his foundation works towards — among other things — saving strays from so-called “euthanasia.” Mr. Simon is currently fighting cancer, and has announced that he is leaving a substantial portion of his 100-million-dollar fortune to PETA. It seems clear that this is a truly decent man, who hasn’t the faintest idea what kind of organization he has decided to leave his money to. The situation is not unusual: most celebrities are kept in the dark regarding PETA’s nature. Mr. Simon is very ill, and it’s perhaps best to tweet your outrage to his foundation (whose work PETA is busy undermining): @ssfoundation1 And please let PETA themselves know what you think: @PETA The citizens unlucky enough to share their neighborhood with PETA headquartershave long been concerned that the group will target their pets. Not many of these people have the means to pursue a civil suit against PETA, but this is why we have criminal laws: it is absurd that a family’s dogs and cats cannot be protected from the depredations of this organization.  PETA is garbage " False link

Join a peaceful protest. They’re happening all around the country tonight, including at the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, around 7 p.m. Eastern.  2. Recognize that Michael Brown’s death was not an isolated incident. In 2012, more than 300 black people were executed by police, security guards, or vigilantes. In the last month, three other unarmed African-American men—Eric Garner in New York, John Crawford III in Beavercreek, Ohio, and Ezell Ford in Los Angeles—have been killed by police. Those are the ones we know about. 3. Stop saying “This can’t be happening in America.” I understand the impulse, I really do. But that impulse only comes to those who are insulated and isolated from how America treats poor people and people of color every day. Langston Hughes wrote “America never was America to me” in 1935. If you didn’t quite understand that poem in your junior high or high-school lit classes, read it again, while you think about what’s happening in Ferguson. Let it sink in. 4. STFU about looting. And call out your friends and family members who won’t. It’s been five days since Michael Brown was murdered. On one of those days, some furious, grieving citizens caused some property damage. Nine have been arrested. Every other day since then, police with more gear than American soldiers going into battle have been occupying the neighborhood where Brown died, attacking peaceful protestors with tear gas and rubber bullets. They’ve tear-gassed a state senator and Al-Jazeera reporters, and arrested an alderman. They’ve demanded that reporters leave the area and arrested two who didn’t move fast enough. “Disproportionate” doesn’t begin to describe it. If you look at all that and still think it’s important to talk about looting for “balance,” you should know that you sound like a racist asshole. 5. Look Around You. If you live in an urban environment, you’re in a position to bear witness and document inappropriate and abusive police behavior. If you see an African-American neighbor being detained by police, wait to see what happens. Get your phone out. Download the ACLU’s “Police Tape” app, and if you see something that looks off, take a video that will upload directly to their servers, in case your phone is confiscated. Whatever police may tell you, this is your legal right. 6. Make a donation to a civil rights organization like the Southern Poverty Law Center or the ACLU.   7. Educate yourself about the systematic inequality that leads to civil unrest. The St. Louis American ran a powerful editorial today that fleshes out the history of Ferguson. When you finish reading that, go somewhere quiet for a bit and settle down with Ta-Nehisi Coates’s “The Case for Reparations.” Don’t stop there. 8. Put pressure on your elected representatives. Institutional abuse of African-American citizens is happening all over the country, and it demands a federal response. Talk to your senators and congresspeople about enacting policies to protect citizens from their protectors. While you’re at it, maybe suggest they work to limit the amount of military weaponry police can inherit from the armed forces. 9. Listen to your African-American friends when they try to tell you why this hurts. If you don’t have any African-American friends, you might want to think about why that is. 10. Okay, go ahead and tweet. And Facebook. Tumblr. Instagram. Vine. Amplify the voices of people on the ground, and help counteract the damaging narratives being propagated by some mainstream media organizations. It’s the very least we can do.    For white people wanting to know what they can do to help." False link
