How did that show and its success affect you personally and professionally?TL: I was on the second season. It was a big hit the first season—a water cooler show where people talked about it the next day. I thought, “Oh wow, what a cool job. I’m going to fly out to L.A. and do a couple of episodes. None of us, Darren (Criss) included, had an idea about the social effect that it was going to have. At that time teens were dealing with things like the Trevor Project and teen suicide and bullying. Because of the LGBT movement, kids were finding the courage to come out in high school, but they did not know how to deal with the ridicule and bullying they encountered. “Glee’s” creators of course wanted to create a hit show, but they also realized they had the eyes and ears of a captive audience—not just in America, but all over the world. They used the storyline between Darren Criss’s and Chris Colfer’s characters to empower kids who were being bullied, who were just coming out, and showed them a very healthy, loving relationship between two teenage boys on prime time television. And that was huge. The show said, “You’re not alone. You may feel really alone, because you don’t belong to any clique, but there is a clique for those people who don’t belong to any clique. And the common thing that will bond you all together is making music.”[Link to complete article]" True text

Do you think it made it easier to grow up gay?  I do, yeah. I mean, we didn’t have anything like that when we were growing up. Can you imagine if we had a show on network television that had a character like Chris Colfer’s character or Darren Criss’  character? And I think kids—not even gay kids, just kids in  general—were able to identify with at least a couple of the characters  on the show and say, Hey, that’s me. And I think a lot of kids who aren’t gay identified with Chris—you know, he’s a big, bestselling author right now.  And he has fans that run the gamut of different kinds of kids. Not just  gay kids, all kids of kids, because he was one of those unique, special,  said what he thought, stood up for himself, and didn’t let anyone tell  him there was something wrong with him. Kids just jumped on board. And  then you have my character (Sue Sylvester) of course, who just is the  person that told them what was wrong with them. And at the same time,  was kind of the protector. And I think that was, kind of, the ideal  place to be. McKinley High. The world of McKinley High, the hallway, was  kind of like the real world.

At least that was how the employees of the Santa Clara Convention Center  saw it. The success of the annual event was never measured by the  number of attendees (sold-out crowds were always a given) but by the  number of injuries the enthusiastic crowd inflicted on one another.Thankfully, the WizCon incidents were never malicious; the  patrons simply buzzed with so much excitement they became a danger to  themselves and others around them. So, the more reported accidents, the  more the event planners were confident they had done their job.And as the early comers outside pressed their bodies against  the glass doors, rabid with anticipation, the convention staff knew  WizCon 2017 was about to break new records.“It’s twelve-oh-one!” said a little boy dressed as a gray alien. “You were supposed to open at noon!”“Come on, we’ve been waiting for hours!” said an old woman dressed as a headless Marie-Antoinette.“Some of us have been here since yesterday!” said a very sleepy teenage girl from a group wearing dinosaur onesies.The convention center was surrounded with a massive gathering  of historical figures, extinct species, and extraterrestrial creatures.  It was an alarming sight to every passing observer, but it was much more  innocent than the psychedelic cult it appeared to be.All these people were at WizCon because they were fans of the hit television series Wiz Kids.  The show was an action/adventure series that followed a trio of young  geniuses who travel through space and time in an invention they  constructed out of a port-a-potty.Naturally, when it first premiered the critics treated the show  like a piñata. Each review of the “ridiculous premise” was more  scathing than the last. Reviewers took great pleasure in ripping it to  shreds and even became competitive with their convictions, each claiming  to have “hated it the most.” However, with each fatal blow Wiz Kids  only received more and more attention. People tuned in to see the  “absurdity” for themselves, but they were not repulsed as promised.  Audiences found the show’s campiness to be rather charming, its unique  underdog spirit resonated with them, and a global phenomenon was born.[Read much more]" True text

Sometimes it’s the comedy, sometimes it’s the mystery, sometimes it’s  the action… But one thing it seems that a show can’t get by without is,  *DUH*: the romance!

While they spent all their time focusing on one couple, it was actually  the side couple that everyone gave an eff about (or maybe we loved the  main pair, too, but it was the secondary one that just really gave us   all the ~feelz~, ya know?). No matter what the reason, we need to give  those overlooked couples the attention that they deserve… because, let’s  be honest here, they were a huge reason the show was the success at  all:TIE: Santana and Brittany & Kurt and Blaine on GleeWhen  Finchel was a thing, both Brittana and Klaine took the backseat for  Rachel and Finn’s romance in terms of screen time… yet the LGBT  couples were really the ones we cared about.Basically, same-sex couples FTW on Glee, now and forever — that’s why they got married!"

Hachette Audio. (Middle grade; ages 8 to 12)  “Frogkisser!” comes several years after the actor Chris Colfer started to publish his own fairy-tale-inspired books with a girl-power twist. Colfer’s series the Land of Stories follows a pair of 12-year-old twins who are magically sucked into a book of fairy tales. (My kids and I are on Vol. 3 of six of the hardcovers.) In Colfer’s books, damsels are rarely in distress. Goldilocks, for instance, is a sword-wielding warrior and Sleeping Beauty hasn’t slept in years because she’s working tirelessly to reform her kingdom.Colfer’s new audiobook, “The Land of Stories: A Treasury of Classic Fairy Tales,” is related to the series, but also a departure. It doesn’t feature the adventuring twins, but instead is a straightforward collection of fairy tales. Twenty-five stories from the Grimm brothers, Hans Christian Andersen and others, are retold and tidied up a bit by Colfer.I recommend it for three reasons. First, Colfer — an actor most famous for playing a countertenor teenager on “Glee” — is a wizard at voices. In “Henny Penny,” he gives distinct, birdlike cadences to a duck, a goose, hen, rooster and a turkey. His yawn from Goldilocks was convincing enough to make me yawn in the driver’s seat.Second, I want my sons to know the original fairy tales, and not just get them filtered through reinterpretations. We live in a world where kids ingest the parodies before the real thing. My children have seen multiple “Twilight Zone” takeoffs (on “Futurama,” for instance), but have never watched an episode of Rod Serling’s show. I suffer from this too. I knew the Puss in Boots character from “Shrek,” but embarrassingly had no notion of the original tale. (Which contains another useful moral: Blatant lies and fraud are the key to success.)Which brings me to my third reason, which is that fairy tales are great conversation starters. Not so much for the lessons they are trying to impart, which are often appalling, but as a way to spark interesting questions. When listening in the car, my kids and I talked about whether Jack is morally justified in stealing gold from the giant just because the giant is a terrible being. Also, does the maiden in “Rumpelstiltskin” owe nothing to the dwarf for his hard work? Perhaps not her firstborn, but at least a token?As I mentioned, Colfer has cleaned up the tales a bit. In terms of rawness, they fall somewhere between the Grimm and Disney versions. For instance, in the Grimm version, Cinderella’s stepsisters chop off a toe and a slice of heel to fit in the slipper. Disney’s “Cinderella” has no gore at all. Colfer’s compromise: The stepsister “crammed her foot inside the slipper so tightly it started to bleed.”Colfer has also, thankfully, left out the truly horrible Grimm stories, like their tale “The Jew in the Thorns,” about a miserly man who is sentenced to death. Not even Disney could make that palatable.But even when softened and redacted, listening to fairy tales can be demented, disturbing fun." True link

One must note that Andrew was a gigolo who craved for attention and the limelight. Darren is with Andrew Greenfield in this photo, whose role in the show has yet to be revealed.According to Vanity Fair, Gianni and Andrew had a connection before the murder. “They had come in contact in a San Francisco nightclub, Colossus, in 1990; Versace was in town because he had designed costumes for the San Francisco Opera. That night, October 21, an eyewitness recalls, Cunanan was smugly pleased that Versace seemed to recognize him,” the report said. It also detailed how Andrew “gushed over” meeting the fashion designer and how it was unclear how and when Gianni met him before recognizing him.Before Gianni’s murder, Andrew had already been on a killing spree, landing him in the Most Wanted list of the F.B.I.Apart from this, we also recently got to see Penelope Cruz donning platinum-blonde locks along with sleek and sexy ensembles as she takes on the role of Donatella Versace.Penelope took on the role that everyone thought Lady Gaga was a shoo-in for. Producer Ryan Murphy cleared up that Gaga’s schedule was too hectic to take on the five-month project in the first place.Ryan has also been posting photos of the set from Versace’s bell to his bedroom window.Edgar Ramirez, who will play Gianni Versace, also dropped a few photos from the set which feature the lavish Italian taste of the designer. Ricky Martin, who will play Gianni’s partner Antonio D’Amico, gives a more candid glimpse of the cast together.Versace: American Crime Story along with Katrina: American Crime Story are both lined up for 2018, following up the successful debut of the series which re-told the story of the O.J.

While many have entered and gained a mega boost of fame from their Glee days, few are making the variety of impact that Darren Criss is today.Since his days of playing the beloved Blaine Anderson in the Dalton Academy Warblers, Criss has since gone on to conquer a slew of different areas in Hollywood. He’s left his mark in the worlds of…and take a deep breath here…music (releasing a solo EP and currently promoting with his ‘80s-inspired duo Computer Games), Broadway (acting in successful stints with How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying and Hedwig and the Angry Inch), television (appearing in The Flash, Supergirl, and landing a role in the upcoming American Crime Story series), movies (making his feature film debut in Girl Most Likely alongside Kristen Wiig and Annette Bening), and even festival curation (he co-founded the annual Broadway-pop festival Elsie Fest). All the while, Criss has continued to be staunch advocate and ally to the LGBTQ community, being a major supporter to The Trevor Project, and speaking out for organizations like Rock the Vote, UNICEF, and Amnesty International. Got all that?Furthermore, Criss acts a shining success story of the underrepresented Asian American community in Hollywood. Along with his brother and Computer Games band mate Chuck, Darren told Fuse about the pride they have from being raised by a Filipino mother. “As you get older and you meet people who have other cultural backgrounds, you start to realize the differences and you either enjoy that difference or maybe it drives you nuts,” Darren shares in the video above. “I happen to really enjoy the fact that we’re half-Filipino, mainly because it’s such a sneak attack. Most people think we’re straight-up white kids.”With his projects boasting as much range as his multi-octave voice, there’s no doubt that Darren Criss can continue his multifaceted approach to taking over Hollywood and doing so with major pride for his culture and background."

The Trevor Project serves more than 100,000 LGBTQ youth every year with their life-saving programs that include the Trevor Lifeline, TrevorChat, Ask Trevor and TrevorSpace.The need for Trevor is very real – lesbian, gay and bisexual youth are more than 4X more likely than their straight peers to attempt suicide, and youth who are questioning their sexual orientation are 3X more likely. For youth between the ages of 10 and 24, suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death nationwide.“After gaining the incredible platform from ‘Glee,’ it wasn’t so much of a decision to get involved as it was an opportunity to take part. I’ll be honest, I’m not so much into the idea of one cause being more important than another; however, I felt that the Trevor Project was a perfect fit for my efforts. It stands for a lot of things that I believe in, as well as falls in line with much of what 'Glee’ stands for.” - Darren Criss, VarietyAlong with Chris and Darren, we support The Trevor Project because of the essential services and hope they provide. Making a donation is fast, easy and secure, and every dollar you give goes directly to saving young lives. You can also help us reach our goal by sharing this page on Facebook or Twitter, or by emailing this page to other people who might want to help.We are hoping to raise at least $1000 by our anniversary date, June 6th.THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CONTRIBUTING TO THIS WORTHY CAUSE!With gratitude,Lynne, Mev, Debbi, Zikh, Zinnia, Natasha[Link to donate]" True link

The media platform is tapping big-name celebrities and major influencers in the LGBT community to throw its first-ever Queer Prom, a star-studded, red-carpet-style bash at Siren Studios in Hollywood on Saturday, May 13. The once-in-a-lifetime event will celebrate “everything a high school prom should be,” according to Buzzfeed, and emphasize themes like inclusivity, diversity, love, and self-expressionYou might be wondering, why throw a designated Queer Prom amidst all the other high school proms? According to Buzzfeed, it’s needed; LGBT youth across the country are often discouraged from participating in the planning of (or in some cases, even attending) their own proms. There’s an unspoken—or in some instances, very spoken—social pressure to follow the so-called “norm” of going to prom with the opposite sex, wearing a suit if you’re a guy and wearing a dress if you’re a girl. For many teens, there isn’t a safe space to express their individuality and enjoy the long-awaited milestone without a dreaded veil of discomfort.That’s where Buzzfeed plans to step in. The online platform is making a statement and throwing an inclusive, magical evening, hosted by Buzzfeed’s Eugene Lee Yang, open to people of all sexual orientations and gender identities, where they can celebrate unity and acceptance with music, dance, celebrity guests and more. Buzzfeed’s hand-selected Queer Prom Court (local high schoolers making a difference in their communities, each of whom will be flown out to Los Angeles and honored at the event) will be joined by students from local high schools, along with LBGT advocates and stars like Adam Lambert, Darren Criss, Latrice Royale, Margaret Cho and Ryan Murphy."

The caption, “Do The Hustle,” may refer to Greenfield’s rumored role as a gay hustler.As previously reported, Versace will be played by Venezuelan actor Edgar Ramirez.
