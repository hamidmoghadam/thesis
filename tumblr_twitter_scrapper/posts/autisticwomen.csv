But — autistic people don’t all have a convenient love of tedious tasks. Some of us find them as boring as everyone else does. This model of “autistic strengths” celebrates us doing jobs everyone else hates. It has no room for us to pursue jobs that others want. We’re supposed to stay in a special place for special people, doing the boring tasks the ideology says we love — and making no trouble for the normal people who do the interesting jobs.  This isn’t ok, and it isn’t acceptance. Some of us like things that others don’t, but none of us should be forced into a box. Autistic people have the full range of interests, talents, and skills that anyone else does. We shouldn’t be tracked into jobs based on stereotypes.

In a thoughtful, academic way, Gernsbacher describes some of the most painful parts of autism stigma and shows why they aren’t true. I seriously recommend reading this paper to anybody who was bullied or labelled a “problem kid”. Her main point is that people apply the ideas of “social reciprocity” and “social skills” unfairly. People blame things like the bullying of autistic children on autistic children not having social skills, as if the people bullying us have nothing to do with it. As if being a bully isn’t a violation of social rules too. Gernsbacher says: “Other items on the Social Reciprocity Scale [a checklist developed by researchers to measure autistic children’s social skills] illustrate the thesis of this article: Some professionals have forgotten the true meaning of reciprocity. Consider the item, “is regarded by other children as odd or weird.” This item appears to measure other children’s lack of social or emotional reciprocity. Regarding another child as odd or weird implicates the regarder—not the target child—as lacking in empathy or understanding.” The rest of the paper goes through several other examples of researchers, teachers and parents who “lack reciprocity” toward autistic people, including some descriptions of ABA therapy. Then it explains some research that shows how much reciprocity and understanding from parents, teachers, etc. can help autistic people. That seems like an obvious thing, but it’s cool to see research that proves it.  FYI - the content of this paper is also available as a powerpoint style presentation with voiceover on vimeo HERE, which might be helpful for those who are interested in the content but find dense blocks of academic text difficult to process. There aren’t any subtitles but the key points are summarised in bullet points, which might be enough to be helpful for those with some auditory processing problems, but not for those who are d/Deaf or who have no comprehension of verbal input.

They share incredibly painful, personal experiences with strangers and subject themselves to abuse from parents and others, to prevent the next generation of autistic people from going through what they did. They know they will be attacked by people who use their disclosures as a weapon. They know they’ll be told they’re too autistic or not autistic enough for their voices to matter, but they keep going anyway. They persist in building a culture, online and in person, while “experts” tell the world that they aren’t capable of having one. They befriend and defend the people no one wants to support because they aren’t cute enough, talented/shiny enough, or useful enough to society. They start careers in autism research, services, teaching, or occupational therapy, where they are effectively in the lion’s den–surrounded by the very “experts” who denigrate autistic people and don’t expect them to be colleagues. Yet they persist in trying to reform these professions from the inside. Often, they do all this with fewer resources than the average person would have. Less physical/mental/emotional energy (“spoons”), other medical conditions like epilepsy, difficulty speaking, and so on.  While carrying extra burdens most neurotypical people don’t have, they do things most neurotypical people wouldn’t even attempt. Why do they do this? Out of the very trait they are said to lack–concern and empathy for other people.   And many don’t limit their concern and activism to people like themselves–other autistic people. They fight for people with all disabilities, and sometimes people in every stigmatized minority group.  Where many neurotypicals only seem able to care about people like themselves, these autistic people cast a broader net. These people are my heroes. They are who I’d like to be, and if I had children, who I’d like them to be. " False text

There were 1340 usable responses at closing time. This is after I removed one duplicate, removed two or three abusive responses, and removed one at the request of the participant. I promoted on Tumblr, Twitter and Reddit, and I’m aware that others promoted on Facebook on my behalf. There’s a more detailed breakdown of where everyone came from further down. This survey was ultimately pretty aimless and led by my own curiosity. I wanted to know how we as autistic people tend to think of ourselves, how we identify and describe ourselves, and whether/how we are diagnosed. I wanted to test a few stereotypes that I’ve picked up over the years. I also threw in a couple of questions for my own personal wossname, like monogamy/non-monogamy, and how people feel about Autism Speaks, etc. I like to do this kind of stuff for fun, and am in no way professionally or academically educated/experienced. Because it’s on the internet, self-selecting, and mostly promoted on a small number of social networks, the results are hella biased and can’t really be held as representative of any group except autistic users of Tumblr, Twitter and Reddit. Still, with over 1,300 responses, I think the results are pretty interesting. You can see the results in full on Google Sheets here. Beware, it is huge and unwieldy. Feel free to make a copy of the sheet and mess about with the stats however you want; if you publish anything using them I’d appreciate a link back to this blog post. :) Read on for wild and amateurish speculation! ~ IN RELATION TO THE AUTISM SPECTRUM I’ve seen people refer to themselves in so many different ways, and with varying capitalisations, so I was curious to see what was most common. Generally, people preferred not to capitalise autistic, aspie, or autie. People preferred “autism spectrum” over “autistic spectrum”. Aside from that, people overwhelmingly preferred identity-first language - “I am autistic” rather than “I have autism”. The fourth most popular was Asperger’s Syndrome, which I thought was interesting, because my understanding was that it’s slowly being phased out. The top 5 ways for us to describe ourselves were: I’m autistic - 66.3% I’m on the [autism] spectrum - 40.8% I’m Autistic - 30.9% I have Asperger’s Syndrome - 29.9% I have an ASD (autism spectrum disorder or autistic spectrum disorder) - 23.1% It’s also worth noting that this question let you choose more than one answer, and lots of people chose both capitalisations. By this I mean that it was not uncommon for one person to choose both “I am autistic” and “I am Autistic”. ~ DIAGNOSIS For this question, participants could again select as many as applied. I wanted to allow people to, for example, tell us that they had been formally diagnosed in childhood and self-diagnosed later - or that they had been formally diagnosed as a result of self-diagnosing and then being later diagnosed by a specialist. While the survey was ongoing, I had a conversation with someone who was opposed to self-diagnosis and felt that it shouldn’t have been an option on the form. I didn’t feel I could remove it so late in the game, and anyway I knew that if it hadn’t been an option I would’ve had to process hundreds of people’s manual write-in “i’m self-diagnosed” submissions, so I left that option there. But I also wanted to acknowledge that self-diagnosis is very context-dependent. The best I could think of doing that wouldn’t take an enormous amount of work was to split the results by all self-diagnosed people (including people who are formally or informally professionally diagnosed) and people who are only self-diagnosed. Here’s the numbers. Only two people didn’t answer this question. Formal/professional/medical diagnosis - 49.0% Self-diagnosis (all) - 45.8% Self-diagnosis (where only this was selected) - 32.5% Informal professional diagnosis - 22.5% Formally diagnosed but not told about it at the time - 11.3% ~ PRE-DIAGNOSIS I was curious about this because I know a few people who self-diagnosed before they were professionally diagnosed. This question was single-choice-only, and there was no “other” box. About a third of participants didn’t answer at all - which matches the ~33% who are only self-diagnosed in the last question. If I had more spoons I might look into whether age plays a part here. A friend of mine suggested that unless you have parents and/or teachers who’re very on-the-ball, you might have to work out what’s going on on your own, and that means that a lot of people might conclude that they’re autistic in their teens - around when a lot of kids are working out, for example, that they’re not straight. ~ AGE Many graphs! Here’s the ages of all participants: I feel I should very remind you here that this statistic shows how biased this survey is. This age graph is more representative of the ages of people who use Reddit, Tumblr, Twitter and Facebook than it is of autism in the general population by age. This next graph is a bit more fun though: Age of diagnosis (red) is relatively spread out, because a lot of folks were diagnosed in childhood - presumably before they could work out they were autistic on their own, and instigated by parents who are a bit sensible and pay attention to how their kids are generally in life. The youngest age of diagnosis was 1, and the oldest 55. You can also see how around the early teens people started to work out that something was up (blue), and there’s a corresponding bump in the red diagnosis line a few years later as those suspicions turn into formal diagnosis for a chunk of people - 22% of people in an earlier question knew that they were autistic before they were formally diagnosed. Overall the yellow and blue lines suggest that most people worked out they were autistic, like, 3 years ago - in their early teens. And the red line suggests that a bunch of those people got a formal diagnosis soon after. There are a lot of people, about a third, who haven’t got a formal diagnosis, but perhaps this is not surprising - most participants were only in their late teens to early twenties when they took the survey. Since services and support for autistic people are so bad perhaps there’s not much advantage to getting diagnosed, especially if you’ve made it this far maybe not even knowing you’re autistic. ~ GENDER My fave! I’m sure a lot of you are aware of the anecdotal overlap between the trans/nonbinary and autistic communities. My gender identity clinic doctor, at the oldest gender identity clinic in the world, says that they see about ten times as many autistic people as are in the general population. And for a long time it was believed that autistic people were more likely to be gay - but now that being gay is more socially acceptable, the numbers are starting to converge. (I don’t have a source for this but I’d love one! If you’ve got it, throw it at me.) I’m curious to know whether there’s anything to suggest a similarity between the autistic-and-queer thing and the autistic-and-trans/nonbinary thing. Again, this survey is very biased. It’s biased by age group and by the places participants came from, and the fact that it was a self-selecting sample on the internet. It would not be reasonable to extrapolate these figures to the general autistic population. On that note, here we go. This is as many as I could fit onto the chart and still have all the gender labels showing. Here’s the percentages of the top 10: nonbinary - 34.1% woman (or girl if younger) - 33.7% trans - 24.3% man (or boy if younger) - 23.3% transgender - 19.8% agender - 15.9% genderqueer - 15.8% cisgender - 15.2% fluid gender/genderfluid - 12.5% enby - 11.8% The low number of people identifying as cisgender is not as indicative as I first thought. It occurred to me that a lot of cisgender people wouldn’t describe themselves as such, and might not even know what it means. A lot of people whose genders differ from the ones they were assigned at birth also don’t relate to the trans/cis labels either. The list of genders was taken from the annual survey of nonbinary people, which includes man and woman. I also added the three autism-related genders that I’ve ever heard of. There were a few comments in the feedback box by people who were annoyed by having to search through the long list for their gender; I’d guess around 5? But only two people skipped the question, so I’d guess the vast majority of people had no practical problems with it, even if a significant number of people may have disliked it. The wording of the question itself was taken from the results of a report from the Equality and Human Rights Commission, who found the following to be most inclusive: “Which of the following describes how you think of yourself?” I was nosy about biases based on social networks, so I split the top 10 gender identities by social network: Reddit is notably less diverse, with a significantly smaller percentage than Twitter and Tumblr for every gender identity except cisgender and man/boy. The only reason I can’t say the same for Reddit vs. Facebook is because Facebook respondents were slightly more likely to say they were cisgender. It’s worth noting that for Twitter there are only 141 responses, so the respondents here are likely only a few degrees of separation from me - and I am aware that my Twitter followership is mostly queer nonbinary people! (They’re only 10% of respondents though.) I’ve run a few surveys of subreddit memberships in the past, and the percentage of nonbinary people is usually around 6-7% for the subreddits I tend to spend time in. (/r/bulletjournal, for example, and I ran one for /r/polyamory years ago but I have no hope of finding the URL of the results.) So it’s interesting to me that the autistic people of Reddit are just as likely to be nonbinary than the general population of Reddit. The subreddits I promoted in were /r/autism, /r/samplesize and /r/neurodiversity. ~ SEXUAL AND ROMANTIC ORIENTATION People could pick as many as they felt they identified with for both of these questions, and plenty picked more than one. For example, lots of people feel that terms like bisexual and asexual fit under the queer umbrella and could truthfully check queer and another term for one question. The top five sexual orientations were: asexual - 31.2% queer - 30.3% bisexual - 23.3% pansexual - 18.4% heterosexual - 16.8% The top 5 romantic orientations were: queer - 27.3% panromantic - 25.1% biromantic - 17.2% heteroromantic - 15.2% I don’t know - 15.2% This one I messed up a little. I regret not including “gay” and “lesbian” as checkbox options from the start; I added them at around 100 respondents, though earlier responses containing those words will still be counted in the stats. I also didn’t include “straight” at any point. I only picked up on “gay” and “lesbian” because someone specifically said that they’re gay and they find the word homosexual to be really unpleasant, so they would have liked for gay to be added to the list. No one asked for “straight” to be included in the list, but a few people did write it in the “other” box. A few people mentioned in the “other” box that I had missed demisexual and demiromantic off the list. If more than one person mentions a particular label I tend to assume that there’s a lot more who would check the box if it was there, so if I do this kind of survey again I will include them. ~ RELATIONSHIP PREFERENCES I have no idea how this compares to the general population or the Tumblr-Reddit-Twitter-Facebook population. But hey, it’s pretty cool, huh? Here it is in number form. It started out being super non-monogamous, because I am non-monogamous and so a lot of my online circles are too. I could tell when the survey was making it out of my immediate circle, because at around the 300 participants mark it started to get a lot more monogamous. ~ LIVING SITUATION I asked about current living situation and ideal living situation, and I’m thinking these figures are mostly representative of the fact that 85% of participants are between 11 and 30 years of age? I’m thinking as people get older they’re more likely to attain independence and an ideal living situation. But I’m not really sure! 56% of people live with the family that raised them, and only 8% of them want to. 30% of participants want to live alone, but only 13% are doing so. A little over a third of people would ideally like to live with friends, which I think is lovely and a very underrated and under-represented lifestyle choice! And 20% of us live with partners, whereas 65% of us would prefer that. I wonder how many people living with partners would rather be alone, but it would be too much work for me to find out so there we are. Forever a mystery. ~ PERSON-FIRST vs. IDENTITY FIRST LANGUAGE Identity-first language, as in “I’m autistic”. It acknowledges one’s autism as an inseparable part of one’s personality and sense of self. Person-first language, as in “person with autism”. This seeks to define a person by their humanity rather than by their diagnosis. I remembered that a while back the National Autistic Society in the UK did a survey and found that autistic people tend to prefer identity-first language. I was curious to see if my results would fit this, and they did - the majority of participants sometimes or always used identity-first language to describe their autism. This was another question where you could select more than one answer, and there was an “other” box - but it’s very difficult for me to count those. Google Forms tells me 30 people selected “other”, but it doesn’t take into account the fact that some submissions were removed. If this number is accurate, then for perspective it’s less than half of the number who chose “I don’t know”. ~ DISABLED? This question asked whether participants would describe themselves as disabled, in whole or in part due to their autism diagnosis. It seems that 83% of participants sometimes or always describe themselves as disabled due to their autism. ~ DESCRIBING OUR ASD-NESS This one was a make-it-up-as-I-go question; for about 100 responses I’d put “disorder” and “condition”, because those were the only terms I could think of. After a few people had entered “neurotype” I added it to the list, and around that time I noticed a few people had put “difference” so I added that too. That means, I think, that over 1,000 people had all four options available to choose from. Neurotype took the lead pretty fast despite being added after the start, and stayed ahead. I can kinda imagine how this happened. Disorder is pretty negative, difference is a little condescending for a lot of people, and condition is a very medical-subtext word. They could all, depending on context, carry a less than implication. Neurotype, on the other hand, is a very neutral word. Autism is one of multiple neurotypes, alongside non-autistic, and probably other neurotypes. It puts autistic people on the same level as non-autistic people in terms of power and social status and mental health. It’s interesting, and I can see the appeal. Again, this was a question that let you choose multiple answers and it’s very difficult for me to count the “other” answers, but Google Forms tells me it’s 146, around 11%. These included words like “disability” and “impairment”, and also terms like “my brain” and “a way of thinking”. ~ WHERE DID YOU FIND OUT ABOUT THIS SURVEY? Again, a question that lets you choose more than one answer, and the “other” answers are hard to count, but Google Forms tells me it may be around 33, or 2.5%. I feel like I’ve covered the stuff about diversity and bias regarding the social networks in sections above, so I don’t really have much to say here! ~ FEELINGS ABOUT AUTISM SPEAKS This question was just thrown in there because it’s something I’ve always wondered. A lot of people are very angry-shouty about Autism Speaks. Is this the prevalent opinion, or does it just seem that way because of the aforementioned angry-shoutiness? That’s a yes, most people did not feel good about Autism Speaks. And it’s worth noting that I listed the “other” answers in the spreadsheet because wow. People skipped having their vote counted as merely “bad” in order to vent some pretty visceral feelings here. ~ OVERALL SUMMARY, THOUGHTS ETC. Well, erm, I don’t really know what to say here. We are autistic and we use social networks, I guess? This was a lot of fun for me, and I hope the results are interesting for you too! I threw this form together hastily, and that probably shows; I think I would be more thoughtful about the wording next time. I also used Google Forms, which is great and accessible and freeeeee but it does have some limitations - mainly in counting the “other” entries and not adjusting its Forms-associated summary graphs when I delete troll or duplicate entries. This is fine, it just takes more time and energy to get the blog post graphs and numbers to be helpful. So yeah! Thank you for taking part, if you took part! And if you’d like to be notified of a future autistic survey that I may or may not run, please feel free to put your email address here. :) " False text

I honestly wasn’t expecting too many people to care at all, and I genuinely thought my post about what inspired me to do this would get buried in the tags really quickly since throughout my life things I’ve taken on have very rarely been acknowledged, let alone acknowledged positively. And this is why the fine folks at Vinesauce are truly incredible - they found my post and actually boosted it, and after I finished freaking out because people I look up to acknowledged me, I couldn’t have been more grateful. I still can’t be more grateful. This is why I admire these people so much - they’re simply amazing. I wasn’t expecting this at all. I’m having what I can only be described as a “positive panic attack” right now because people really are interested and now I have roughly two months to round up my troops and pull all of this together! I’ve recruited a number of fellow autistic gamers already, but if you’re interested in contributing in any way, you’re more than welcome to join in! Charity streams are a big operation, especially when your streaming team is just starting out and getting organized.  Our current goal is to do monthly streams to help support @autisticadvocacy and @autisticwomen, and right now we’re aiming for the end of May for our first one. I’m currently in the process of building our website here (please don’t mind the dust, I’m still working), and we’ll be around on social media, too. In the meantime, as we get going here, if you want updates on the project as it comes along you can follow me here on Tumblr, on Twitter at @1863_project, or on my blog Asperger’s Illustrated, where I’ve been talking about the project in between other AS issues. You can also track the tag ‘Autistic Gaming Initiative’ on here since I’ll be using it quite a bit!  Again, I can’t thank all of you enough for your interest in this project and for your support - this has been amazing, and I’m so stoked to actually get streaming with the team we’ve built so far!   Thank you for the support! " False text

Contact your Members of Congress and tell them to vote NO on ACA repeal. We asked Congress to show us their plan for replacement. They finally did, and it’s a disaster. If this bill passes, millions of Americans will lose health insurance coverage. This bill will make it harder to buy insurance, and insurance companies will be allowed to charge disabled people more money for worse health coverage–including autistic people. As if that wasn’t bad enough, the bill will drastically cut Medicaid over the next 10 years, and slash funding for services people with disabilities rely on every day. The Affordable Care Act helped more people, including people with disabilities, get health coverage. A plan that doesn’t do the same thing is not a replacement for the ACA.  If we’re going to fight this, we need to do it fast. Our calls are working, but your members of congress need to hear from you again. You can find contact information for your U.S. Representative here, and for your two Senators here. Call them and tell them to vote NO on ACA repeal. Script for calling your Members of Congress: My name is [your full name]. I’m a constituent of [Representative Name/ Senator Name], and I live in [your town]. I’m calling to ask [the Representative/ the Senator] to vote NO on the current budget reconciliation which repeals the Affordable Care Act. This bill would take lifesaving health coverage away from your constituents, and it would cut funding for Medicaid services that people depend on to live in the community. A bill that causes millions of Americans to lose their health coverage isn’t a replacement for the Affordable Care Act. Please vote NO on the budget reconciliation.    There is a lot at risk in this moment, but we really can make a difference by speaking out. Don’t let them take away our health care without a fight. Make sure they know: Nothing About Us Without Us! P.S. -  ASAN’s new plain-language toolkit They Work For Us: A Self-Advocate’s Guide to Getting Through to your Elected Officials includes strategies, scripts, and templates to help you effectively communicate with your elected officials. We also have a separate factsheet on How to Call Your Elected Officials. You can use these tools to help you when you call your Members of Congress and tell them to vote NO on repealing the ACA.
