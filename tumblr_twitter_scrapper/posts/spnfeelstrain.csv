The time is drawing near. My train is going, I see it in your eyes, the love, the need, your tears. But I’ll be lonely without you. And I’ll need your love to see me through. So please believe me, my heart is in your hands. And I’ll be missing you.‘Cause you know it’s you babe, whenever I get weary, and I’ve had enough, feel like giving up. You know it’s you babe, giving me the courage, and the strength I need. Please believe that it’s true. Babe, I love you.Dean had only meant to come here for a hunt, but here he was two years later, laying in bed next to you as he watched you sleep. He hadn’t been to the bunker in God knows how long; when he went on hunts with his brother he would just meet Sam wherever it was they needed to be, but this house with you, it was his home now. He had fallen madly in love with you and never wanted to leave.He knew, however, that he had no choice but to leave you now, him being here was starting to put you in danger, and he couldn’t have that. He watched as you opened your eyes and looked up at him with love glistening in those pretty spheres. Man, he was gonna have a hard time letting go of you. A small yawn escaped your lips as you cuddled closer to him, relishing in the heat he gave off. “Do you want me to make breakfast?” You smiled up at him.Dean nodded, “Yeah,” he said, like this was some special treat he would have to savor. And little did you know it was, for he didn’t plan to have breakfast with you again, at least not for a long time. You stayed in bed for a few moments longer, before you worked up the motivation to leave the comfort of the soft blankets, and more importantly Dean.He was soon making his way into the kitchen himself though, and when he got close enough to you he wrapped his arms around you, placing loving kisses in your hair. Man, he loved your hair. He breathed in the smell of your shampoo before letting you go. He was planning on telling you he had to leave as soon as possible, but he decided it could at least wait until after breakfast, so he could have one last meal with you.Your meal was nice, though you did most of the talking, because Dean was too busy soaking up your every move, trying to remember how your eyes darting from him to the food as you talked and the exact way you held your fork. It was silly, but Dean wanted to try to remember as much of you as he could. “Dean, are you ok?” You asked, setting your plate to the side. His behavior was starting to worry you and for good reason.Dean took a deep breath and pushed his own plate away, facing you straight on. “(Y/n), I-” he drew a sigh and started his sentence again, “I gotta go,hun. It’s not safe for you to be around me anymore.” A cloud of silence filled the kitchen and settled, during which time Dean’s eyes searched your face, trying to decipher what you were feeling. “(Y/n), you know I love you, and I don’t want to leave you, but I have to. For your safety.”You knew about Dean’s line of…work, and you knew that was why he felt the need to leave. “Dean, I don’t care about- about demons, or vampires or whatever it is that you think is going to come after me,” you assured him, but Dean just gave you a sad look in return. “How about lucifer?” He asked with a dry chuckle.Your eyes grew wide at the name, “As in, evil, cast down from heaven, satan, Lucifer?” It had to be someone else, what would Lucifer want with you? You were probably as insignificant to him as a flea.You couldn’t even fathom the fact that Lucfer might come after you. Besides, Dean had never mentioned that the devil was up and about.“Yep, that’s the one,” Dean pursed his lips and looked at you, hoping now you might realise the gravity of the situation. “I know that he’s gonna try to get me, and I can’t have him try to get to me through you.” You didn’t want Dean to leave, but you understood that he didn’t want you to get hurt, and that he probably wouldn’t be able to save you if Lucifer did come after you.You looked at Dean for a moment and nodded, “I get it,” you told him giving him a slight nod and a smile. “So, um, when are you leaving?” You asked. You didn’t even know if you wanted an answer. You sure as hell didn’t want to be having this conversation, but you knew you had to, and as much as you wanted Dean to tell you that he was never leaving, you knew too, that that wasn’t the case.If you thought Dean’s gaze couldn’t be any more sorrow filled, you were wrong. You knew the answer before he even said anything. “Today,” tears threatened to spill down your face, but you didn’t want that to happen, you knew Dean didn’t want to hurt you, so kept strong for him. “I’m catching the 11 o’ clock train, Sam’s gonna pick me up on the other end.”You bit your lip and nodded, but it quickly donned on you that Dean didn’t need to take a train. “What about baby?” you knew Dean loved that car, it had been with him all this life, it was his pride and joy, it was quite literally his baby.Dean cleared his throat, the tears that he too was holding back making his throat dry, “I uhh, I thought I’d leave it here. You know, so you can remember me. And as a promise that I’ll be back once this is all over.” Now you couldn’t help but start to ball. Him leaving baby for you was more than you could take and made this whole thing real. It finally hit you good and hard that Dean was leaving, and you couldn’t take it. Dean pulled your head into his chest running his hands through your hair and whispering sweet nothings and mumbling a “hush” and “shh” every now and then. When you finally pulled away your eyes were puffy and Dean’s shirt was tear stained. A glance at the clock showed that it was getting late, and you stood up simultaneously. That small action alone made you want to burst into another round of tears. You were so good together, so in sync. And that was all going to go away. You followed Dean up the stairs and helped him back, sniffles escaping each of you here and there as you folded clothes. Every time your hands brushed against each other Dean winced and you felt tears prick at the back of your eyes. Dean hated leaving you, you were his everything. You were the reason he didn’t drink himself under the table every night or just quit and let a demon kill him. You were the reason he could sleep at night, when his whole life consists of blood and death and tears. You gave him strength and courage. You made everything alright.He looked over at you now, as you pulled one of his army surplus jackets closer to you, looking at him with tears in your eyes as you hugged it close, silently asking him to keep it. You knew a car was more than you could ask for, but you couldn’t cuddle a car, you couldn’t wrap it around you when you missed him in the night. He could see the pain and sorry in your eyes along with so many other things: not wanting him to leave, fear, love. Dean issued a small nod that earned him a sad smile as you slipped it on already.It seemed like all too soon Dean’s things were packed and you were making your way down the stairs once more, Dean’s luggage over his shoulders, and your hand in his. You gripped it like your hand alone was the only thing that was keeping him there a second longer. When he reached the front door you didn’t want to let go, but when Dean had to set his things down you had no choice. “Do you want me to give you a ride to the train station?” you offered in a soft and surprisingly un-shaky voice.“It’ll just make things harder. Jeff from the bar is going to give me a ride,” you nodded up at Dean, your mouth turning into a frown and water pooling in your eyes once more. “Shh,” he pulled you in for a hung once more, one of those calming, big hugs where he just pulls you right into him and makes you feel so safe. You were gonna miss those. “I’ll be back I promise,” you nodded and reached up to kiss those perfect lips of his one more time before he grabbed up his bags and walked out the door.You watched him walk down to the end of the street where Jeff awaited him, from your window. Tears were already starting to flow down your face as you watched him stride, bow-legged, away from you. Dean looked back at you a couple of times as he walked, catching your eyes as you looked out the window, and there were tears running down his face too." True text

I knew from the minute I laid eyes n her that I would end up falling in love with her, but it didn’t matter to me. I wanted to be able to hold her and spoil her and kiss those pretty red lips of hers.Red was the colour of the dress she wore on our first date. It was a beautiful dress, that clung to her body in all the right was, but it was nothing in comparison to her. She made her hair look even more amazing than normal, and her lips were rendered that same candy apple red once more.Her voice sounded like red velvet when she told me that she loved me. Her voice gave my name the appeal of a glistening ruby when it fell from her lips. Be it Crowley or even the dreaded Fergus, anything she said sounded like a freshly polished sapphire looked.When I thought of her, I always thought about red. It reminded me of the love I felt for her, and the sound of her heart beating in the middle of the night. Or the way her cheeks flamed when I whispered in her ear. She was the best thing that ever happened to me, and that’s not just a cliche over exaggeration The love and passion I had for her was red. And too, was red, the blood that stained my fingers and pooled on the ground when her life was taken from me all too soon. Try as I might, I couldn’t bring her back and it killed me. Anger blazed red in veins, but even if I found the asshole who did this to her, I could never get her back.I missed the sound of her beating heart, that now lay still and silent. I missed how rosy her cheeks got when I said just the right words. I missed the red passion we shared and the way she told me that he loved me, and the way my name sounded coming from her cherry lips. I miss the dates and that red dress that I loved oh so well. The dress that I had her buried in." True text

You were out hunting for some food in the woods and after yesterday’s hunt, where Dean had let a family of werewolves live, Sam thought it might be time that he told Dean about your little secret. You and Sam had always told Dean that you had met on a hunt and you worked together to take down a vampire who was massacring the town.While that was true, there were a few things that you neglected to mention, like the fact that you were a vampire yourself and you had been after the other vamp because she double-crossed you. Thus far neither of you had thought it was something worth mentioning to Dean, he lived life thinking you were a hunter, and you both just let Dean think that. It wasn’t lying technically, he had never asked, so you never told. Sam, however, didn’t like keeping things from his brother, so he decided all on his own that he would tell Dean, in hopes that with his seemingly newfound understanding for supernatural beings, Dean might not be so quick to shove a stake through your unbeating heart.Sam looked up from the book that he had been staring at for the past half hour when he heard the door of the bunker slam shut, and the sound of Dean’s boots clanging against the stairs. Judging by the smile on Dean’s face he was still in a good mood, which was a relief to Sam. “I got pie,” he said, holding up a plastic back to show the long haired hunter. Sam gave a tight-lipped smile and a nod to his brother, “That’s great Dean, can we uh, can we talk?” Sam wasn’t really sure how to go about this, but he was trying to make things go as smooth as possible. He waited until Dean was able to put his precious pie in the kitchen, before his older brother came out and took a seat across from him.“What’s up, Sammy?” Dean asked. Something told Sam that Dean had no idea what lie ahead in this conversation of theirs, but he only hoped it wouldn’t turn out too bad. Sam feared the worse, but he had to keep reminding himself that Dean had spared some werewolves that he didn’t even know, so surely he would be ok with you being a vampire.“It’s about (y/n),” Sam began, and seeing the raised eyebrows he was getting from the older man, he was quick to assure him everything was ok, “It’s nothing bad! Or good really, it’s just, there’s something I need to tell you about her.” Sam looked almost guilty, and his brother took note of that. After a moment of silence, Dean urged his brother on, “Well, what’s up, is she like secretly a demon planning to start the apocalypse or some princess from a far away land or something?” Dean was being sarcastic, but he wasn’t exactly that far from the truth. “Actually, more like a bunny eating vampire,” Sam waited with bated breath for Dean to say something, and to his great relief, his brother cracked a smile.“What like a-a vegetarian vampire? A vegpire? Are you kidding me, c’mon Sam-” “I’m serious Dean. (y/n)’s a vampire. Fangs, blood lust, and all. Only she feeds on animals and occasionally donated blood,” any trace of levity left Dean’s face once he realised that his brother was being serious. “Sam, what the hell’s wrong with you?!” Dean asked, “First Ruby and now this? When will you learn? Jesus Sam, do you remember Madison? Now you’ll have to kill (y/n) too!” Dean was beyond livid, but that didn’t bother Sam. It was Dean’s talk of killing you that caught his attention.“What do you mean, I’ll have to kill her Dean?” Sam asked, looking at his brother with distrustful eyes.“Well we can’t keep her alive, she’s a- how long have you known this?” Realisation that Sam might have known about this for much longer than a week or two like Dean had previously thought hit the eldest brother suddenly, and he now mimic Sam’s look of distrust with his own. “I’ve always known Dean,” Sam said with a scoff,”(y/n)’s not bad. She told me what she was straight away.” Sam wished that Dean would understand, he thought that he would, but now he saw how wrong he was. “You’ve known all this time and you haven’t told me? I can’t believe you, Sam! How could you lie to me like that? How could you let me sleep under the same roof as a vampire and not tell me!?”“I didn’t lie to you Dean, you never asked-”“Lies of omission Sam! We have to kill her.” Dean’s voice was calmer now, and he spoke with authority, but Sam dismissed it. “Why? She’s never hurt anyone. She’s been nothing but kind to you, give her a chance Dean.” Sam pleaded with his brother. He wouldn’t kill you no matter what Dean said, but it would be nice to have Dean’s approval.“She’s a vampire, Sam. They’re all the same.”“No they’re not, and you know that. You let those werewolves go. And what about Benny? What’s so different between Benny and (y/n)?” Sam challenged.“I wasn’t sleeping with Benny!” Dean exploded, his hands flying into the air.“So?” Sam asked, “Dean, you know how much she means to me. She can’t help what she is. I’m not gonna let you kill her Dean. I just really want you to be okay with us.” Sam gave his brother those puppy dog eyes that Dean found so hard to resist. Sam could see his brother’s resolve fading, but before Dean could say anything they heard light steps on the stairs and both turned to see you walking toward them.  You looked between them with furrowed eyebrows and a slightly tilted head.“What’s going on, guys?” " True text

You stopped in California and spent the week at a water front hotel, which was paid with a fraudulent credit card of course. You went swimming almost every day…and night, and sipped expensive whine by the water. You knew it wasn’t something that would happen again soon, so you made sure to take a bunch of pictures. It wasn’t a week in Paris, or a trip to Orlando Studios, but it was perfect for you. Sam:When Sam found out about a program in New York called Hike and Hound, where you could take shelter dogs out for a hike, Sam had to go, and you had no objections. After all, who wouldn’t want to make a poor pup’s day better? You made a whole day out if it, you packed lunch and brought a camera to take pictures and of course you brought dog treats. Sam seemed to be glowing the whole day, and you had to admit that you had a lot of fun yourself. The only hard part was saying goodbye to the dog at the end of the day. Castiel:You didn’t go on vacation to a place, but rather a time: 1921. You had always been in love with the 20s, and yes,m you knew it wasn’t like i romanticized to be, nor did it have all the extravagances of The Great Gatsby, but you still loved it. That’s why Castiel decided to take you back there for a day so you could experience what it was like first hand, and boy was it great. You went to the Cotton Club and saw performances that you just couldn’t get today, and danced dances that seemed near impossible. It was a blast for both you and Castiel, and not something you would forget anytime soon.Crowley:Crowley was the king of hell, and as such nothing was too extravagant for his queen, which is why he insisted you vacation in Aruba. It wasn’t his first choice, he had wanted to go somewhere even better, but you had talked him down to just going to Aruba. It was simply wonderful with water the colour you had only ever seen in pictures and the most beautiful climate. You almost wanted to stay there forever, and while Crowley said you could, you had to put your foot down at that. You did many things while you were there, like swimming with dolphins, snorkeling and all those other exciting attractions. It truly was a blast." True text

The red looked really good on you, it was subtle but still obviously dyed, and even though Dean loved your natural colour he could totally get used to this.Sam:Sam hadn’t been so sure about you dying your hair, he reminded you several times that it wasn’t good for your hair, but you ignored him and got your hair doe anyway. Despite Sam not thinking getting your hair dyed was a good idea, he was still super anxious to see what it would look like because you refused to tell him the colour, so he would be surprised, and boy was he ever! He really liked it, it was defiantly you. For a while after Sam just kept playing with your hair, loving so see the teal locks fall through his fingers.Castiel:Castiel was absolutely fascinated when he saw your ombre hair. He had seen people on the streets walking around with different coloured hair every now and then, but he had never seen hair quite like yours, nor had he known anyone personally with dyed hair. He kept looking at in fascination for weeks after you got it done and asked a lot of questions, which you gladly answered.Crowley:When you told Crowley about your hair dying idea he was all for it. He knew it would look good on you, and he could tell you were excited so he was too. He went with you when you got it done and watched the whole process. It came out even better than both of you thought it would. Crowley would always randomly ask you to spin for him so he could see all the colours swirl around. He just couldn’t get over how pretty it looked. " True text

He had these feelings for her, that he had never felt before. He tried to hide these feelings, because he knew that whatever they were, they made him weak. She made him weak, which was why he was at her doorstep now.He had stayed away for as long as he could, knowing that the other angels wouldn’t approve if they found out. He didn’t blame them, he wouldn’t have approved either, but he just couldn’t resist her, no matter how hard he tried. He thought maybe he should just leave, walk away and try to be strong, but he couldn’t. He needed her.He reached up and rapped his knuckles against the door. He was fully aware that as soon as she opened the door he was never going to be able to resist these feelings he had for the human any longer, but he was beyond caring about that. A smile spread across Bartholomew’s face when the door was opened to reveal you. You were beautiful, his father’s best creation, as far as the angel was concerned.  He felt a pang in his chest when your eyes lit up in that way he loved oh so much. “Bartholomew!” You exclaimed happily, opening the door wide to let him in side. The angel smiled at you and entered your house taking in the front room that he knew all so well. “it’s been a while” you pointed out.“I’ve been busy,” he replied, “angel stuff,” it was enough of an explanation for you. You knew how ‘angel stuff’ could be, not from first hand experience of course, but you understood enough to know it could be hectic. “Ahh, and how’s that going,” you ask, taking a seat on the couch, and gesturing for him to sit as well. Bartholomew took the offered seat and looked at you for a moment, like he wanted to say something, but he wasn’t sure how to broach the topic. You tilted your head, furrowing your eyebrows in a silent question. “That’s what I came to talk to you about” he told you. Upon your look of confusion, he elaborated. “Despite the fact that angels aren’t supposed to have romantic feelings for humans…I’ve decided to do this.” Bartholomew moved closer to you and cupped your cheeks in his hands, before pressing his lips against yours. Your reaction was immediate. You brought your hands up to his cheeks as well and kissed he angel back. Bartholomew had been oh! so right. There was no way he would ever be able to resist you again. And he was 100% ok with that."

That man was one hell of a hunter. And could we talk about his ass? Sam Winchester was the man of your dreams, he was nice and sweet and oh so smart! Boy oh boy, did you love that man. “You’re drooling.” You perked your head up at the words, looking at the long haired hunter and tilting your head slightly. “It’s ok, girl,” he said with a little chuckle, reaching out his hand to rub your head, behind your ear. A contented sound left your mouth as you leaned against him, loving the feeling of Sam scratching behind your ears. You reached up to lick his cheek affectingly and Sam laughed some more, though he was distracted from you by his phone ringing. “Hello?” He asked once he brought his phone up to his ear.”Ok, I’ll be right there.” He stood, gently sliding you off him. “I’ll be back in a little bit alright, be good,” he gave you a pointed look before he shut the door behind him. You laid on the couch for a few moments before you made your way into the bathroom. After closing the door behind you, you let your front legs grow into hands and your snout turn into a nose. You looked yourself in the mirror and ran a hand through your hair. Yes, you were a familiar, and Sam didn’t even know. It wasn’t like you could just come out and say “Oh yeah, by the way, I’m also a human sometimes.” Actually that’s exactly what you could do, but you didn’t have the courage to. You were pretty shy and awkward as a human, but as a dog you didn’t have to worry about having to talk to people, or someone not liking you, all you had to do was get pet and look cute.You wished you could tell Sam that you were a familiar, but you were just too afraid. What if Sam didn’t like you, or else he was mad because you hadn’t told him sooner. No, you couldn’t do that! Your witch, Angela had told you to just go for it, but you were too afraid. You knew that you would never get anywhere farther than just starting at and dreaming about Sam if you only remained a dog to him, but you hoped maybe you could content yourself with that.You were disrupted fro your thoughts when thought you heard the familiar sound of the familiar sound of the Impala. You quickly splashed some water on your face and sighed before opened the door a crack and once again turning back into the furry dog Sam loved. Once back into your doggie form you nudged the door the rest of the way open and ran to the couch where you took a seat and watched for Sam to come around the corner.Sure enough, Sam soon came along and with him was Dean. An excited yelp escaped your snout, and while Dean rolled his eyes, Sam let out a happy laugh. He walked over and started petting you, rubbing your head and whatnot. “Did you miss me?” He asked, and you once again let out a yelp of joy. He didn’t even know the half of it. " True text

It became your go to show when you and Dean had some free time. It was relatable to your own lives in some ways, which made it all the more enjoyable to watch.Sam:Mr. RobotYou and Sam saw a commercial for the Mr. Robot, and both being into tech, you decided to check it out. After one episode you were hooked, Sam loved the mystery and you claimed the Elliot was your spirit animal. You were both always shocked by his computer skills, and talked about how you wished you could be that good.Castiel:Stranger ThingsCastiel was a bit of a Netflix addict, so when you kept hearing people talk about Stranger Things Castiel really wanted to watch it. You thought it looked pretty cool too, so you both decided to watch it together. You thought it was super col, and Cas was always left amazed at the things that happened. Once you finished the first thing the two of your did was look for when season 2 would be out.Crowley: Downtown AbbeyHonestly, who doesn’t love Maggie Smith? Add on the fact that you had heard nothing but good things about the series, and you decided to watch it. You made Crowley watch it with you, and though it was only begrudgingly at first, by the end of the second episode even Crowley was snickering here and there and was fully invested in the program."

Once that was squared away and everything Dean brought you back to your cell and the guard brought the other prison back to his cell as well.“So I guess I’ll see you, huh?” You asked Dean, leaning your arms against the cold bars. You knew it was too much to ask to see if Dean could get you out, but you had still hoped he might, up until now. It was now evident that Dean wasn’t going ton get you out, but you understood. At least you had gotten to see a familiar face and go on one last hunt.“Yeah, I’ll see you around,” Dean said with a wink. You chuckled a little and smiled at Dean, as he reminded you why you had fallen in love with him at one point. Hell, maybe you even liked him a little still, but that was never gonna happen. Even if you had decided to give it a second chance you couldn’t. You watched as Dean walked down the hall, still smiling a little before you went to bed.The next day went on almost as normal, other than the fact that some people were taken into questioning- namely those who had been involved in the events of the previous night- and while all day you waited for be called into questioning next you never were.This struck you as odd, and you went back to your cell that night with an unsettling feeling.Because of this feeling you didn’t get much sleep, so when you heard the echo of footsteps coming down the hall, you walked over to the cell bars to see what was going on. You were shocked when you saw Dean, along with two guards coming down the hall. Dean was the last person you expected to see, you thought he would have been long gone by now, off to another hunt in another town, but when the three came to stop in front of your cell you knew exactly what as going on. The cell doors opened and your arms were grabbed, as you were ushered out of the cell. “What’s going on?” You played along, looking between the two guards and Dean, but nobody said anything. You asked a few more times, until you thought you had played off that you didn’t know what was going on well enough, then you remained silent, until after paperwork being filled out and handcuffs being put on you, you were finally outside. “Dean-”“Shh, they’re watching.” Dean muttered as he placed you in the back of the car. Sam sat in passenger side of the Impala, and once you were out of sight from the prison Sam turned back and smiled at you. “Hey, (y/n),” he said, “It’s nice to see you,”You smiled at Sam and nodded, as Dean pulled over on the side of the road and hopped out. “You too Sam,” you told him. It was good to be seeing familiar faces again after being locked away. Dean opened your door and you got out, while Dean reached into his pocket for the keys. You shut your door behind you, making Dean give you a puzzled look as he uncuffed you. “Thank you for getting me out Dean.” You reached up and wrapped your arms around Dean’s neck, pulling him down for a kiss. He stood in shock at first before he kissed back, placing his hands on your hips. After a moment you pulled away and smiled up at Dean. Dean smiled back down at you, a sort of gleeful, half smile and gave you a wink. “No problem, sweetheart,” he said. You gave a small giggle as you looked up at Dean, before you saw a flash, and you both looked over at Sam, who was already sending the picture who knew where. You and Dean both shared a look before you got into Baby. Dean looked at you in the rear view mirror and you smiled back at him. Next to him, Sam had the phone up to his ear, waiting for someone to pick up. “I told you they’d get back together Bobby.”" True text

C’mon, let’s go!” You made a face as you rolled over and looked at the bars to your cell, where Dean’s form was silhouetted. “C’mon I found out who the shifter is,” Dean spoke again.You frowned and made your way over to the bars that Dean gripped with his hands. “Dean, can you even be here right now?” You asked the hunter. People rarely ever came at night, and if it did it was probably for some more important reason than what ever Dean could make up. “This says I can,” Dean held up a key card that he no doubt stole from a guard, before he started to unlock your cell with more stolen keys. “Dean, the cameras-” you said, but Dean stopped you. “The guard was in the bathroom. I switched up the tape with one from last week.” You nodded and slipped out of the cell while Dean quietly locked the cell up once more. You just hoped the guard didn’t realise the tape had been switched.“Which cell is he in?” You asked as you and Dean crept down the hall, but Dean shook his head.“It’s not a prisoner, at least not anymore. It was that guy you were talking to, I saw it on the tape, but he went missing an hour after. I told them I would monitor the cameras while they looked for him, and I found out who the shifter is now,” you made to talk, but Dean hushed you and listened, the sound of wheels and footsteps reaching bother of your ears.Dean jerked his head to the right, a silent command for you to get against the wall. He passed a silver blade over to you, while he held his own at the ready as the two of you waited. You watched as the janitor rounded the corner, light from the moon, catching his eyes, and making the light up in a way only only shapeshifter’s eyes can light up.Dean lunged for the shifter, but he made a run for it,you shooting off after the shifter. You could hear Dean’s loud footfalls behind you as he tried to catch up. You followed the shifter to the boiler room, taking he stairs too at a time, but with the janitor’s knowledge of the place he hid himself well. Your eyes scanned the room, before you turned to Dean who had just came to a stop behind you.You signaled Dean to go left while you made your way to the right side of the room, using all your senses to try to find the shifter. As you walked toward the back of the room you made a interesting discovery. All tied to a pole were the people the shifter had changed into. The staired at you in horror, and you couldn’t blame them, since you were wielding a sword. You pressed your finger up to your lips as you kept walking, but you didn’t need to. You heard Dean holler for you on the other side of the room.You sprinted off in the direction of Dean’s voice, heading the shifter off right before he got to the stairs. It didn’t take a moment of thought for you to plunge the sword into the shifter’s heart, adrenaline coursing through your veins as the shifter cried out. Dean rounded the corner and gave you a smile upon seeing the shifter dead. “Nice work, (y/n).”" True text

I’ve been trying to see if I could notice any differences, but it’s hard to tell. And it’s not like I have any sil-”Dean passed you a necklace and you looked around to make sure nobody was watching before you shoved it in your bra.”Never mind, I’ll start checking asap,” you told him. Despite the fact that you were normally off to the corner by yourself you pretty well liked around here, so it shouldn’t be that hard for you to test people out. “Come by at evening break time, I’ll have a list of all the prisoners for you, and I’ll mark off the ones who are safe.” “Alright, sounds good, I’ll see you then,” Dean said, before he stood up to leave. And so the rest of the day you made your rounds, talking to the other inmates, asking them questions, trying to find anything odd, and for the most part showing them the necklace you had gotten, but none of them were afraid to touch it. It wasn’t until you got to an older lady, in her 50s named Zelda that you were met with hesitance. “Oh, well it’s very nice,but I’d rather not touch it, then I might wish I had one.” She laughed and you laughed along with her, but she was officially on your list.Only one other person didn’t want to touch the necklace, and that was Tod, who claimed to be allergic. You couldn’t be sure which was the shifter was, but it narrowed the process down some. You were happy to be able to report to Dean that there were only two people who hadn’t passed the test. You pointed them out to Dean and he set off dutifully toward Zelda, and introduced herself, shaking her hand with what appeared to be a silver ring. “Well, it’s not Zelda,“ Dean said, once had taken a seat once more. “She sure is a flirty old gal though, how come you didn’t tell me?” He asked.You laughed and shrugged, “I didn’t know,” you told him. It was miraculous how happy Dean made you feel, you hadn’t been as happy in this place the whole time you had been here as you were now with Dean. “That must mean that it’s Tod then.” You cast your eyes on the man who sat in a corner, watching the other inmates. “Maybe you should try to watch the video camera,” you suggested.“There’s no way they’re going to let me do that, I don’t have any need to,” he said, but you only smirked at him. “I can take care of that,” you stood and walked over to a rather tough looking inmate, and talked for a moment, pointing at someone, Dean couldn’t tell who, before after a moment you came to sit back down next to him. “Well?” Dean asked.“Just wait.”A few moments later the muscular guy made his way over to a group of people playing cars, and within a few seconds a fight broke out. Dean looked over at you and winked at him, “Looks like you’ll have to see who started it,” You told him. Dean looked at you with admiration for a moment before he left to do exactly that, while the guards tried to break up the fight. You put your feet up on the table as you watched, a satisfied smirk upon your visage. It felt good to be back in the swing of things." True text
