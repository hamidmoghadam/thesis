Happy new year everyone! I updated the list with a BUNCH of YouTube videos I found! Please make sure to post a reply if you want added to the list, as it does take forever to search on YouTube! Happy Simming :)This challenge I made up for The Sims 3 while deciding my next legacy. I’ve decided to re-create it for The Sims 4! Please note as well that there is only one ending this time round. Please feel free to follow previous rules and create your own characters! I’d love to see what people come up with, let me know if you’re doing the challenge. :)SIMS 3: http://forums.thesims.com/en_US/discussion/760184/the-disney-princess-challenge-10-generation-legacyIt’s based off of the Disney Princess franchise and movies. Storytellers can follow the original stories or you can just roll with it. Some areas of this challenge ask for gender specific heir/heiresses, this can be easily changed out if you’re playing a patriarchy or matriarchy. This challenge follows the original rules of the 10 Generation Legacy - although some rules may vary. Enjoy! Generation 1: Snow White “I’m wishing for the one I love to find me today” Founders have humble beginnings, so what’s better than Snow White? To start, create Snow White. Storytellers may create her as a teenager and make her evil stepmother, but this is not a requirement. When Snow White becomes a young adult, this story begins. - Must be female - Must have 7 children (dwarfs) - Each child must have one bad trait (e.g Gloomy)- Each child must have the same baby daddy - Each child must complete their Aspiration and/or get an A in school- Snow may never answer the door to strangers or talk to elderly women Generation 2: Cinderella “A dream is a wish your heart makes, when you’re fast asleep” Although you had six brothers and sisters, you always did the cooking and cleaning. Yet, somehow you loved it, as it transported you away from your chaotic home life. When Cinderella becomes a teenager, this story begins. - Must have ‘Neat’ and ‘Foodie’ traits - Must clean the house everyday and cook every meal - May not marry until mother dies (This does not have to be of old age, but it may not be cheated) - Have a maximum of 3 children Generation 3: Tiana “The only way to get what you want in this world is through hard work” Your family has barely accomplished anything over the past two generations, and you’re here to change that.

When Belle becomes a YA, this story begins. - Must have ‘Bookworm’ trait - Date at least 5 men - Meet the man of your dreams - an ugly sim - Marry, have kids - Your spouse becomes beautiful (Changed in CAS) after first born child Generation 8: Mulan “Could it be, that if I were truly to be myself, I would break my family’s heart” Your parents always wanted you to bring fortune back to the family and marry someone of high status, but you didn’t dream of love, you dreamed of glory.
