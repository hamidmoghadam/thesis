You are 3/4th the way through May so your super close!  Maybe track cals for he next 2 days and if that doesn’t make the negative thoughts and feels go away then you could just weigh Saturday as planned  I think I’ll do that. :) Thanks. I appreciate the help with this. I’m such a beginner at this kind of stuff. I don’t want to give up with stuff when it gets hard or nothing would get done. I’ll start doing my calorie counting again.

I figured I might as well tell y'all about me a bit. I have always been overweight. It’s always bothered me. In high school I kept my weight below 200 by skipping meals and doing marching band. Then I graduated and had my first kiddo. I broke 200 and haven’t been below it since. Since I was 19 I’ve gained about 40 pounds (so that’s like almost ten years of weight gain). Part of that weight gain has been 5 pregnancies, part of it has been hypothyroidism, the last part is pizza and lazy. But I’m aware that there needed to be a change.  I started watching how much I ate in December 2016… and I still gained about 5 pounds, so I decided to do something I knew worked. I started a Beachbody program and started using the 21 day fix meal plan and Shakeology along with my workouts.  Now 7 weeks after starting that I’m less than half a pound away from a ten pound weight loss.  I’m refusing to use my thyroid and my life as a busy mom of five as a crutch anymore. I turn 30 in July 2018. I want to lose a minimum of 60 pounds by then, but I’m really pushing towards my ultimate goal of 100 pounds being gone forever. :)  TL;DR  I’m a mom of five kids under 8 years old with hypothyroid. I’m only 28 and trying to lose 60-100 pound before my 30th in 2018. So, it’s been a little while and I have a smidge over 2k followers now. (Y'all still rock, in case you didn’t get the memo.) Here’s a little blurb about me. 😘 Have a great day!" False text

That doesn’t have to mean you need to sit around doing nothing for 24 hours. Sunday can be set aside for self-care. (And if Sunday isn’t your day off during the week, make sure you take some time off at least once a week to refill your “batteries”.)One thing that has become an important part of my personal self care regimen is meditation. I know it may sound hokey, but it really does help. If the idea of meditation scares your or even makes you laugh, that’s okay. Honestly, meditation is a practice that can help you focus your mind on the present. Which is something that can be hard to do if you have depression and anxiety like I do.Anxiety causes me to worry about things in the future, while my depression keeps me tied to things that have happened in the past. It’s an exhausting way to live. I started guided meditations last year. It feels weird at first and I did feel kind of stupid sitting in a quiet room with my eyes closed.Meditation has helped be more present in my day to day life. I’ve been able to allow my mind to see things that have happened or may happen, but the thoughts (after a year of meditation) are starting to become fleeting as I live more in the present.I promise this isn’t some mumbo-jumbo. Your mind can be trained just like any other part of your body. You can train your mind to focus on the good. Of course, life won’t always be good. Bad things will come and go, but learning to live in the present can drastically improve the way you view the world and the events of your life.If you want to give meditation a try I recommend the app “Stop, Breathe & Think”. I found it for free on the app store and it’s the one I’ve used. It helped me a lot when I was first starting meditation. There are a lot of other guided meditation apps and programs out there too. I’m not being paid or anything to talk about this app. I just really like it.So take 3, 6, 13, 30 minutes today and do something that can help improve yourself. Take care of yourself. Be gentle to yourself. You are an amazing person! " True text
