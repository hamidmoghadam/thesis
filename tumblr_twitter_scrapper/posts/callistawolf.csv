There’s really no medium like this. The experience is over in a couple hours with a movie.  We can control how quickly we read a book (even if we have to wait for additional sequels). But television? Television is a week to week story that spans years. Or at least it is if you watch live from start to finish. Television can be a long and arduous journey. Full of ups and downs. Great episodes and horribly bad ones.  We walk the road with the characters in real time. It’s a serious time investment and the hope is the story eventually connects. That the threads the writers weave come together in the end and we can see the full picture.  ""Lian Yu"" is one of those rare storytelling gifts that repays all the many years of patience.   We started this journey with Oliver Queen five years ago. We have walked each step with him. We’ve rejoiced with Oliver in his moments of triumph.  We’ve grieved with him.  We threw things at him with every maddening step backward.  Step by step, we’ve watched Oliver come back to life.  It hurt and he fought it for a long time, but slowly Oliver began to learn how to live again. Instead of shutting himself off, he chose to build a life filled with purpose honor  teamwork friendship family  and love.  He’s clawed his way out of the dark and into the light that was always there, deep inside.   It was all leading somewhere. A destination, a choice, Oliver had to make. No matter how far Oliver has come there is always a piece of him that remains on the island… and on the boat.  Oliver had to return to Lian Yu, one last time, so he could finally let it go. So he could finally come home. A hero’s story is fraught with triumph and tragedy. There is both in “Lian Yu.” The great tragedy is once Oliver decides who he is, and is ready for all that entails, he’s faced with an impossible choice and loses what he’s spent years building. Or did he? Adrian Chase is the master chess player. He was always ten moves ahead, even in the final moments, but perhaps there was a move Chase couldn’t foresee. One Oliver set in motion years ago, in a moment where he clung to the light and held to Diggle and Felicity’s faith in him. A moment where Oliver kept a promise. Let’s dig in… Keep reading " False text

I’m still working out how to rank it in my head but let’s just say for now that it was a vast improvement over last year’s finale. It felt legitimately like an Arrow finale and that’s a very good thing. So what were my thoughts? Well… I may have waited too long and forgotten all my witticisms, but let’s give this a go…I’m a little uncomfortable how much I’m enjoying Slade in this ep.Seriously, I was all ready to hate him and from that first scene in the prison bunker i was just all (with fondness) “oh… you!”  Dammit. Adrian blowing up Oliver’s plane is about the most predictable thing about this finale. And of course Oliver let all the weapons and ammo on the plane. OF COURSE. Slade giving Oliver crap cuz he married Nyssa and not Felicity: SAME. Evelyn remains trash. Seeing her get locked in a cage fills me with joy.FELICITY JUST LAYING ONE ON OLIVER WOWOWShe just said… “fuckit, I’m gonna kiss him” and I admire her so much for that.And before you come at me, he kissed her back. I saw the pucker. But boy was surprised. Look at that furrowed brow. I love it!I love her reason for doing it too… she didn’t want to have any regrets. SHE ALREADY REGRETS SO MUCH BETWEEN THEM 😩I bet one thing she regrets is telling Oliver the door was closed in 5x05. Maybe dating Billy? GAH. SO MUCH WASTED TIME. And if that wasn’t all perfect enough, we had Oliver promising (rather sexily I might add) that they’d talk all about it after they get off the island.(season 6, Imma hold you to that promise)AND THEN THEY HUGGED. IT WAS SO PRECIOUS. Bury me at Lian Yu, I am torn asunder. And then some other stuff happened THE ENDJK. They all split up at this point with the intention of Felicity and Curtis and Thea and Malcolm and Samantha all going to this plane and gtfo that damn island. I like the talk Felicity had with Samantha… I saw shades of future co-parents there, I don’t know about you. Then Thea steps on a landmine. And Malcolm pushes her off and takes her place. And suddenly I find myself a little sad that Malcolm is gonna die. He takes Boomerang with him tho, which is aces. I LOVE THE TALK THEA AND FELICITY HAD. HUGS. SISTERS IN LAW. I LOVE IT. Plus was that some foreshadowing about Felicity’s own evil dad? HMM. Oh yeah and Oliver is hunting wabbits. Or rather Adrian. He really wants to find WilliamI didn’t buy Slade’s “double cross” at the temple for a hot second, fyi. But it was a slick trick to bring Dinah her new sonic booster device so YAY for that. And Quentin being the one to officially bestow the Black Canary mantle? YAS QUEEN. The battle is pretty lit. Love Talia vs Nyssa. Love Siren vs Canary too. Because Quentin clocked Siren and it was so damn shady that I could probably watch the gifs forever. So much for that redemption arc huh?#pettyThe showdown between Adrian and Oliver has me so damn lit. Oliver refusing to kill Adrian is probably the proudest I’ve ever been of this character. That was a moment I waited 5 years to see. SO FRICKIN SATISFYING.The shot of Oliver running through the forest, chasing Adrian, hoping to find William… that’s just gorgeous. As gorgeous as this show GETS. I love Oliver talking via comms to Felicity, btwNetworked bombs ALL OVER THE ISLAND is bad news tho which you know means they all have to go off fuckfuckfuckSee you on the boat. That fuckin boat. POWERFUL moments though.Speaking of powerful: the flashbacks.I loved seeing how they synced up with the pilot, with Oliver being rescued…that felt AMAZING to see. And that phone call to MOIRA… That’s some of Stephen’s finest work to date, I swear to god. Good job. I had the feels. Speaking of which: his reaction when Adrian pulls William out is just… wow.But good on him for not making that awful choice, for making Adrian THINK he’s making a choice, for shooting that fucker in the foot. SO MUCH DAD!OLIVER FEELSThen Adrian kills himself (I KNEW IT) and the island goes BOOM. Oops. Okay listen. I know I said “pshhh they won’t do that” but… they did. 😂 I mean, I wasn’t wrong about the BOAT not blowing up. And I honestly didn’t think they would blow up the whole ISLAND. My objection stands: we know who’s coming back next season. So it’s kinda a lame cliffhanger. But there are a few variables here so that’s that. Eh, sometimes I’m wrong. It is what it is. But I don’t care cuz that finale was  a m a z i n g. " True text

Enjoy!! Just in case…. Just in case… Just in case… He couldn’t tear his eyes away from the destruction ripping apart the island, the island that seemed to never stop taking from him, as her voice echoed in his head. That innate protectiveness that drove him was screaming at him to move, to save them— somehow save them, no matter how irrational it seemed that there was a chance they were still alive, but it was like all the oxygen had left his body when Chase pulled that trigger. His body felt heavy, his feet glued to the spot as he clung to his son. The one part of him he knew for certain he hadn’t lost and couldn’t bear to let go of for even a second.  “Oliver…” William croaked, “Dad?”  The sound of his shaking voice unfroze him and he dropped to his knees to look him in the eye. He couldn’t find the capacity to form words yet, shock still numbing his brain as explosions continued to echo through the air, so he just squeezed his shoulder reassuringly. Like he had done so many times with Felicity when words failed him.  He tried not to think about the words he should have said to her before he let her walk away. Words he might have forever lost his chance to say.  William’s eyes drifted over his shoulder to the fire blazing on the shore, “My mom… is she…”  “I don’t know.” He wouldn’t give him false hope, wouldn’t placate him with, “she’s going to be okay,” wouldn’t assure anything else that he couldn’t be certain of. He had already made that mistake. Pain, the kind he never wanted his son to feel and would give anything to spare him from, flickered in his eyes as his small hand grasped his arm tightly.  Just in case… The coms. He was afraid to try, afraid to be met with silence. Closing his eyes, he tapped that spot over his heart.  Keep reading " False text

I have plans, big plans, to get us through the hiatus-induced, lack of Olicity that begins with the ending of the Season Finale tonight! But first I want to gauge interest in the idea.. The plan is this: Every Wednesday I will post a writing prompt.  All participants will have until the following Wednesday to write, beta, and post their response to the prompt.   When you post, tag the fic #Olicity Hiatus Fic-a-Thon. That’s it!  No length requirements, no rating requirements, just anything your brilliant minds come up with that include the prompt idea! This way we will all get our regular influx of Olicity goodness to fill the void left by our favorite couple not lighting up our screens every Wednesday night. The last installment of fic will come the night before Arrow returns on Thursdays. If you’re interested, REBLOG THIS post or MESSAGE ME to let me know.  Pass it on to anyone you think might be interested.  If there’s no interest, I won’t do it.

To her dismay, all she was greeted with was mostly empty shelves. She was not a big grocery shopping person to begin with, and with everything they had been dealing with over the past couple of weeks, she couldn’t remember the last time she pushed a cart through those fluorescent lit aisles. “How did Oliver manage to be the Green Arrow and keep our refrigerator stocked,” she muttered to herself as she checked a container of yogurt to discover it had expired months ago.  Her eyes caught the box from Oliver’s party the night before and she slid it out, remembering that there had been a few leftover slices of cake. They were on summer break after all, so cake was an acceptable dinner… right? She was debating eating it straight from the box versus preserving some of her dignity and getting a plate when she remembered that she didn’t have to spend her evening sitting at her counter eating cake alone.  Setting the box down and reaching for her phone, she hit her first number on speed dial and waited while it rang. Which wasn’t a long wait since he picked up before the first ring had finished.  “Are you okay?”  “Yes… Am I only allowed to call when I’m in danger?” she teased. There was a pause. “Well, no I just—“ “Do you want to come over tonight?” She needed to get the words out before he gave her enough time to talk herself out of it. She could practically see his eyebrow rise in that way it did when she said something that could have multiple interpretations and she hastily added, “There’s just leftover birthday cake and I was about to eat it but I realized that you should probably get dibs on it since it was for your birthday.” And also, I just really want to see you. “I promise this isn’t a ruse. But if you’re busy I understand and—” “No,” he interrupted her. “No I’m not busy. I’m just finishing up at City Hall and then I can be right over.”  The corners of her mouth flicked up in a small smile at the eagerness he was trying so hard and yet failing to hide in his voice.

I went back to look over it and was impressed by how much I got right (and how much I got wrong too 😂). But now, with the finale looming large, I want to focus on that. Maybe expand on and revise some of my expectations and hopes and dreams. Expectations: In my previous, I said this about what I expected to see: I expect everything to be a lot. Lots of fighting, lots of drama… I expect some satisfying emotional moments as well. I expect to see Moira get the call in flashbacks that Oliver has been found. I expect Oliver to finally let go of his father’s legacy and claim a new legacy of his own. I expect Adrian to be defeated and for him to die but not by Oliver’s hand. I expect a decent body count but I expect Oliver, Dig, Felicity, Thea, Lance, Dinah, Rene to all survive. I expect the cliffhanger to tie directly into season 6.I still have these expectations, more or less. But I have a few to add to the list: I expect Malcolm Merlyn to die, doing something to help or save TheaI expect the big heroes vs villains showdown as teased in the promos. I expect William to learn Oliver is his father and/or the Green ArrowI expect to see Oliver and Felicity kiss, hopefully while he’s in the Green Arrow suitI expect Oliver to hold firm to his moral code and refuse to kill AdrianHopes and DreamsOriginally, I said this about what I hoped to see in the finale: I hope to see Oliver employing a new moral code that involves no more killing. I hope to see Slade Wilson die because I’m tired of both him and Manu. I hope to see William, if he’s there, to learn Oliver is his father. If it doesn’t happen this episode, then I think it might happen in 5x22. I hope to see Oliver and Felicity already reunited in heart but a good hug and/or kiss when he sees her again wouldn’t be amiss. I hope to see Oliver leaving the island behind for good.I don’t expect to see Slade die anymore, not with Merlyn filling that role so neatly. I expect Slade will be freed out into the world. But the rest of this still holds, even if some of it is more expectation than hope at this point. 😉There’s some other things I’d like to see though: I’d like to see Dinah kick Siren’s butt, even if BS ultimately scampers awayI kinda hope that Adrian has William stashed on the half-sunken Amazo cuz this would help “see you on the boat” make a lil more sense than just being a one-off line of dialogue from 5x22I want to see William view his father as a hero, probably going against what Adrian is hoping he’ll see. Talia should probably die. And I still have zero ideas about the cliffhanger beyond it doing something to set up season 6. This is me: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 😂 But it’ll be a good time, right? Who’s excited??" True text

Emotional and action packed with zinging dialogue.  What struck me most was how full circle it was. “Missing” sets up the heroes versus villains battle that will come to fruition in the finale, but it also kicks off the basic question Oliver must ask: What makes a hero? What makes a villain? Those concepts are not always rigid. In fact, the very essence of hero and villain is fluid. Oh… and did I mention there’s an Olicity reunion scene?

It’s bittersweet; I’m glad to put this year behind us but I’m also sad there’ll be no more new Arrow for several months. I’ll miss it, to be sure. But, given the events of this episode, I’m really hoping that there will be plenty of fanfic from my favorite authors to tide me over. 😉Quentin wishing Oliver a happy birthday fills me with all kinds of warm feelings. Did we ever think, back in s1, that we’d ever get here? Thea teasing Oliver about his “date” with Felicity is a million kinds of fantastic and something I’ve always wanted. It’s made even better knowing that she KNEW ABOUT THE PARTY THE WHOLE TIME.Seeing Oliver happy and nervous and excited is something I’ve really missed. The smooth way that Oliver took down Curtis fills me with all kinds of Feelings. That Lord Mesa cake is so meta that it’s pretty glorious. I’m not sure it qualifies as “amazing” or worth all the buzz but I’ll let it go. Cuz I’m a reasonable sort. This whole birthday is so beautiful and wonderful and so long past due… It feels RIGHT. I love seeing Oliver be celebrated by his loved ones. As it should be. We were doing great on the “how I want to spend my Summer Vacation” thing till we got to Felicity… and then Oliver. SOCKS? REALLY?Socks=sexIs it just me or were there volumes of innuendo to Felicity’s whole “hiking and spending the night under the stars” thing? Those smoldering looks between her and Oliver didn’t help things. And as if I wasn’t already dead from that eye fucking, then the team “subtly” leaves them alone to talk and they AGREE TO START DATING AGAIN.Have mercy on my poor heart, Arrow, I’m only human.Forget socks, this is what Oliver wanted for his birthday. “Hypothetically dating my ex-fiancee” It’s okay, I’m okay, this is fine. I’m fine. Curtis teasing Felicity about her sexual tension with Oliver is all of us, let’s be honest. Oh look, Curtis got taken. I’m so shocked. (not that shocked)Oliver worrying about Felicity and wanting her to stay down in the bunker with him is just… that’s where I’m at folks. This is fine. But the Black Siren blah blah blah *snore* I’m sorry, did something happen? Anyways, Quentin is awesome and deserves better. But you all already knew that. Felicity not wanting to leave Oliver alone, because she’s worried about him… that is NOW where I’m at. I’m fine. Oliver’s desperation and … upset at learning Dig and Felicity were taken… that is where I am going to be and stay and I AM NOT FINE.Yep. I’m gonna stay here a while. It’s a nice place. And then Malcolm gives a big pep talk speech about leaving the island and letting people in and how people help us retain our humanity and…what? WHAT? What’s going on here?Malcolm is being the beacon of hope? Where did that come from???Oh that man is so dead. He’s dying. That’s it. That’s his big redemption. Welp. Oliver’s emotions over Chase taking William are so real and pure and just… WOW. “He’s my boy.” There’s a branch in my eye.Delightful moment when Malcolm and Nyssa get pissy about working with each other.Though, if Nyssa could stop with the husband nonsense and they could just END THAT NONSENSE I’d be a happier viewer. ITS BEEN TWO YEARS, GUGGENHEIM. LET IT GO.It took Oliver far longer than it should have to realize Adrian took everyone to the island. “See you on the boat” was pretty clear. Also… no one took a boat. What is this boat nonsense? I have questions. “Ms. Smoak.” Damn right, and don’t you forget it. Blessed, blessed interaction.Blah blah blah Slade Wilson blah blah kid blah blahJoin us next week folks. Things will most certainly get lit. And enjoy Olicity being reunited. It’s official. TV Line said so. 😉" True text

All expressing some sort of concern about Olicity reuniting in this season. Disregarding anything I’ve posted about it previously. I answered this question. Repeatedly. I don’t know what else you guys need me to do. I’ve said this so many times I feel like a broken record, but here goes. One more time for the books. The show doesn’t concern me. The narrative paints a clear picture. The interviews don’t worry me. They’re constructed to make us doubt and wonder (and they do a good job with some of you). Getting piled with twelve anons in an hour all asking the same question (more or less), however, makes me wonder what I’m even doing here. No one listens to what I say. They want me to answer their specific question, even if I’ve answered so many others that are worded rather similarly. My previous ”yes, I believe they reunite in s5″ response is constantly called into question.“What about now?”“Do you still think this?”“How about now?”Yes, I still do. No amount of anons in my inbox is going to make me think otherwise. However, the constant barrage does steal what enjoyment I’m getting out of this. I can’t sit and go “yes, it’s all finally happening” without someone in my ear “do you still think they reunite??”I understand some of you need more reassurance. Believe me, I got the memo. And I don’t want to belittle that need. I understand why people are worried. What I do not understand is why no one takes me at my word. Why I am continually asked this same question over and over and over and over? Can’t you read my blog, look at my previous responses and say, “okay, I guess she still believes”? I’m gonna guess the answer is no so I’m turning off anon. I just want to enjoy these last two eps.

There comes a moment in every person’s life when you realize your life is your own, a separate entity beyond your parent’s expectations and dreams for you. You also see your parents for what they are… imperfect people just like you. There is freedom in these realizations and it is a crucial part of adulthood.  As you grow older, your life is less and less defined by being what your parents leave behind. You begin to wonder what you will leave behind. You define a legacy for yourself.

It’s going to be really emotional. It’s going to be all about Oliver’s family, but not the family we’re thinking of right now. It’s going to end in a giant explosion, but not where we think it’s going to end, and the emotional punch is going to be bigger than the actual physical part of the bombs going off.   Oooh! Yeah season finale spoilers!!  Alliances - I think it would be really cool for Oliver to team up with Malcolm Merlyn. All the Tommy references this year and Malcolm’s Legion of Doom arc on LOT, I’m thinking there could be a chance for emotional growth. Also, Malcolm is the reason Oliver ended up on that Island and he was the S1 Big Bad. So it would be very full circle if they teamed up. Family - “Not the family we’re thinking of right now.” This feels like a William reference. Maybe William is kidnapped? They must absolutely connect this finale to Robert Queen too. And I think Felicity could factor into that statement. I still think she could be kidnapped too. (Or maybe that’s wishful thinking, but I don’t care cause I love it *Jen hugs her spec*) Giant explosion - Blowing up the Island would be an AMAZING way to end the flashbacks and Oliver’s five year journey. (How does one blow up an island though?) Emotional punch bigger than the physical explosion? Yes, please. It’s a finale and it’s the end of the 5 year journey. It better pack one hell of a punch. @callistawolf speculated that Prometheus kills himself in the end, which I agree with. I think that’d be a great way to cap off the show down - and really represents the darker road Oliver could have traveled. It’d also be pretty emotional if someone died in the explosion. As per usual, I nominate Malcolm Merlyn. He sacrifices himself in the end to save them all, bringing his arc full circle. Truth be told, I don’t really have a clear idea on how this is all going to play out, but I’m kind of loving that. It’s fun to be surprised. I think this finale is going to be awesome though.

We’re still wondering about 5x20, for pity’s sake. But… I can’t help myself. While MG hasn’t released the official title page for 5x22 yet, apparently the title has been leaked. At first, I didn’t buy it was real cuz “Missing” doesn’t sound like a Bruce Springsteen song title. But then I googled it. And guess what? It’s a song by Bruce Springsteen. Even better? These are the lyrics: (and here’s where I put the lyrics but Jen provided them kindly above so I don’t need to do that again…)So. Here’s what I think. This last weekend we heard a few things about this episode. One was that we get to celebrate Oliver’s birthday for the first time in 5 years. His birthday is 5/16 and this episode airs 5/17 so I think it’s a safe bet that the birthday is dealt with in this episode. We heard that the birthday starts with violence but ends better. My guess? Oliver and Felicity reunite in this episode. On his birthday. Have the sex. Another thing revealed about 5x22 was that Stephen thinks we’ll be more excited for the finale than we ever have been for this show. Which sorta indicates that 5x22 ends in a very exciting way. What if Olicity reunite in 5x22, have the sex at the loft, and Oliver wakes up the next morning and she’s GONE. Missing. Prometheus stole into the loft (which we know he’s done before) and TOOK HER. To Lian Yu, of course. Where he’s gonna let all the nutbars in the ARGUS prison out to play fight the team. I mean, I think that sounds like an exciting finale to me, I don’t know about you!"

Sometimes, there’s a second creature that walks just like the other duck.This is not the case on Arrow. The only real “duck” during all five seasons of the show so far has been Oliver and Felicity.

But that’s not the MAJOR part of this spec. The MAJOR part comes from this: But when two other people take up the mantle and ruin the reputation of the hero, he dives back in, leading to a climax where he’s unmasked on national TV. From there, he goes on a downward spiral of violence and madness, culminating in his decision to commit suicide. Thus ends the saga of Adrian Chase.Y’all! THIS is perfect. It fits in perfectly with where I expect Oliver is going to go this season. I’ve low-key thought that the season would end with Oliver outing himself as the Green Arrow. There was a part of me that thought it’d be exposed for him (by Susan Williams or the baddie or whatever) but look at this. ADRIAN CHASE is here to be that example instead. THIS will lead to Oliver outing himself. I’ve also always thought that there would be a question about his reputation and we might see the mirror of that in DA Chase’s story. Because Chase is the cautionary tale and Oliver will be the one who triumphs. If they follow this canon, and it sounds like they intend to, I think this will ALL be very very very cool. " False link

It has always been this way, as long as there has been  television and the networks that appear on it. Despite all the things  that have changed about the business over the past 75 years, that has  been the constant, that a TV network is all about getting eyes on its  programming. Except, of course, when it’s not. Take, for instance, The CW. Now, I am not here to suggest that ratings and the number of viewers  are not the prime directives of the newest broadcast network. The reason  I’m not here to do that is because I don’t have to. It’s already been  done by people actually connected to the network itself. Not only has CW  president Mark Pedowitz suggested that ratings and live viewings of his  programming aren’t that important to him, but also Les Moonves, one of  its owners, who went so far as to suggest that the programs it  broadcasts bring in the revenue, rather than the network that shows  them. But let’s back up a step and clarify what, exactly, The CW is and  isn’t. It is the fifth broadcast network, established exactly 10 years  ago when the CBS-owned UPN and the Time Warner-owned WB networks merged  to form The CW. It specifically targets young adult viewers, especially  young women in the 18-34 age demographic. It offers original programming  two hours each weeknight, as well as a single hour during those  afternoons, and a five-hour Saturday morning animation block. The total  of 20 hours is by far the least amount of any of the five networks, and  is generally why it is often dismissed as something of an afterthought,  especially when considered in relation to the numbers of viewers drawn  by, say, CBS. Last year, in fact, CBS averaged 10.91 million viewers per  show, while The CW’s average was 1.98 million. No, those aren’t typos,  those really are the numbers. The thing is, though, that judging purely on that discrepancy alone  isn’t entirely fair because the goals of a CBS are entirely different  from its sister network. The CW is not the same kind of broadcast  network as the others, for the simple reason that, as mentioned above,  it doesn’t rely on the same factors that are so important to ABC, CBS,  NBC, and Fox. Ratings are secondary to the introduction of shows that  will eventually be watched across multiple platforms. These same shows  that appear on the network are not, like those of other networks,  provided by a myriad of suppliers and production entities. The CW only  shows programming created by one of its two owners — it has never aired  anything from 20th Century Fox TV, NBCUniversal or ABC Studios— thereby  bringing in more revenue than is lost by the network. Because of that,  the standard comparisons of revenue and operating income don’t carry the  same weight since, unlike the others, that’s not the network’s raison  d’être. See, while the other nets are in the business of making money off  their live viewership, The CW was created as a vessel for first-run  domestic broadcast, for the purposes of creating programming ripe for  syndication and, thus, a much more profitable second-run deal. It takes  88 episodes of a show to achieve that number, and The CW was created  with the singular purpose of getting the shows of its parent companies  to the qualifying numbers. While the new output deal the network has  signed with Netflix lowers that number to a single season for streaming  purposes, that doesn’t change the requirements needed for broadcast on  local affiliates, cable networks and other over-the-air entities. A perfect example is Supernatural, a show entering its 12th  season and which has been around so long, it premiered before The CW  even existed. It is, in fact, the last vestige of The WB, the only show  remaining from that obsolete network. The talk now is that the show will  probably end with its 300th episode, an astounding number that would  make it one of the most prolific and successful hour-long dramas in  history. It is syndicated all over the world (including here on TNT) and  an ongoing cash cow for its creators and the production company behind  it: Warner Bros. TV. But it wouldn’t have lasted more than one season,  perhaps two, on any other network, simply because its viewer numbers and  ratings weren’t high enough. Even last year, in its 11th season on the  air, it was the 158th ranked show in average viewers, with just 2.275  million per week, and scored just a 1.0 rating. For the sake of comparison, the CBS drama Limitless debuted  last year as one of the top ten most-watched new shows, finished as the  38th most-watched show overall, with an average of 9.8 million viewers  each week and a solid rating of 2.2, and was promptly canceled. If that  doesn’t perfectly illustrate the difference between the two, it’s tough  to find a better example to satisfy you.  With that in mind, we need to look at the network’s lineup in an  entirely different manner from how we look at those of the others. It’s  one thing to program with the goal of a ratings behemoth, it’s another  to do so looking for cult hits that will fetch a solid price in the  secondary market. To wit, the network’s synergistic relationship with DC  Comics that has produced three original shows and a fourth that has  moved from CBS. Starting in 2012 with Arrow, the network began a  partnership with its in-house comic book company that has scored solid  ratings with its target demographic, and kickstarted a trend of  superhero television that either has you overjoyed or incredibly  frustrated. Either way, the arrival of Arrow four years ago was a very  important one for the network, not only because of the precedent it  set but also because of its continued relationship with the show’s  creator, Greg Berlanti. The show was an instant hit with viewers and  made a star out of Stephen Amell. It also led to the creation, after two  successful years, of The Flash, which quickly became the  network’s most-watched show, with an average of more than 4.2 million  viewers per week. The combined success of those two shows led to a  third, DC’s Legends of Tomorrow, which actually drew more viewers last year in its first season than Arrow did in its fourth, 3.1 million to 2.9 million.  On the surface, that 10.2 million combined viewers doesn’t sound so impressive, especially when you consider that re-runs of The Big Bang Theory — sorry, sorry, encore presentations  — garnered the exact same number and was the 33rd ranked show on TV.  But, again, with different goals come different definitions of success.  It’s partly for this reason why it was a no brainer to shift Supergirl  from CBS to The CW. The freshman adventure hour started off strongly  for the Tiffany Network, eventually leveling off to 9.8 million viewers  per week (39th highest), and a 2.4 rating (27th), both of which would be  enormous on The CW. Since that network’s budgets and capacities are  proportionally smaller, the show will be somewhat scaled down, but if it  retains just half of its viewership, it will instantly become the  network’s most-watched show. And by a good margin. Thinking of it another way, if even just a third of the viewership  travels from one channel to another, it will still be the second-most  watched show. This, from an hour-long drama that wasn’t strong enough  for CBS to keep. So, starting next week, four nights each week will have at least one hour dedicated to a DC superhero. Season Two of Supergirl on Mondays, Season Three of The Flash on Tuesdays, Season Five of Arrow on Wednesdays, and Season Two of DC’s Legends of Tomorrow  on Thursdays. It’s a veritable extravaganza of superheroics, and all on  the same, smallish network. The thing about these shows, as well, is  they even though they are, on the surface, meant for fanboys, they are  actually strong with the network’s target audience, young women, as  well. The combination of sexy male stars and strong female ones is a  perfect one for the demographic, but of course they are just the  gateways to get people in the door. Without well-developed characters,  strong and appealing serialized storytelling, pulse-pounding action and  just enough romance to keep everyone on their toes, they wouldn’t stick  around. Numbers suggest that they do, and that they aren’t going  anywhere. This coming season should be especially interesting because of the  shows being paired with the superhero shows (all of which are at least  co-created by Berlanti), as well as the fifth night of programming,  which has an appeal all its own. Supergirl serves as the lead-in for the third season of Jane the Virgin, giving Monday a decidedly feminist bent. The Flash is followed by No Tomorrow,  a dramedy about a young woman who is told by a man that the apocalypse  is coming and that she should live her life to the fullest while she  still can. After Arrow on Wednesday night is the adaptation of the 2000 sci-fi thriller Frequency, starring Peyton List as a young detective who talks to her long-dead father through a Ham radio. Supernatural follows Legends on Thursdays, while Fridays will see the eighth and final season of The Vampire Diaries leading in to one of the most original and exciting shows the network has ever produced, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, which enters its second season on a new night. The new deal signed with Netflix could also end up bringing lots of  new viewers to the new seasons of each show. There is a history of such  actions, most famously with Breaking Bad, which exploded in  popularity after its first three seasons started streaming on the  service, thereby giving viewers a chance to catch up and then start  watching it on its network, AMC. Likewise, now that Arrow is appearing several times each day on TNT, it could do for that show what syndication did for TBBT,  which went from a solid performer to the most-watched scripted show on  television. Being conservative, there’s no reason why a million new  viewers could start watching each show this season, which would only add  to the potential profits generated from those all-important second-run  sales. Once the calendar turns to 2017, five other shows will debut, four of  them returning from last year, including the third season of another DC  Comics adaptation, iZombie, as well as the fourth seasons of Vampire Diaries spinoff The Originals, the post-apocalyptic YA drama The 100 and the period epic Reign. Joining them will be yet another Berlanti show, the nourish take on the Archie comic book series, Riverdale. The network’s relationship with Berlanti is, obviously, the most  important one they have, but they are also tight with Julie Plec, who is  behind The Vampire Diaries and The Originals, as well as the limited series Containment,  which was the rare show canceled after just one season (the only show  that was on the 2015-16 fall schedule that isn’t returning is America’s Next Top Model, which ended after 23 cycles but is making a comeback on VH1). She also has the conspiracy thriller Rise  in development at the network, alongside several other shows all  designed for, yes, this particular younger audience. Adaptations of the  films The Lost Boys and The Notebook are both on the docket, as is a younger reimagining of the classic 80s soap opera Dynasty.  Other projects include one about a young woman whose terminal cancer is  cured, forcing her to face the decisions she made when she thought she  was dying, at least a couple shows dealing with murder mysteries, and a  new paranormal show from Diaries co-creator, and legendary writer of young adult fare, Kevin Williamson. In short, if you like the current material, there’s lots more where that came from. One big change from years past comes on the streaming side, where CW  shows are no longer available on Hulu. While episodes won’t appear on  Netflix until eight days after the season finale (at which point, the  entire season will be watchable), in-season streaming rights stick with  the network’s website and apps. It created its CW Seed digital platform  in 2013, in preparation for the day when it would separate from Hulu  (which did not make advertising revenue available to the network the way  it does for ABC, NBC and Fox). That time has come, as the network has  rolled out its app on Roku, Apple TV, Xbox, Chromecast and Amazon Fire,  and will be amping up marketing efforts to direct audiences to the new  destinations. Clearly, The CW does its business unlike any other network. Indeed,  perhaps differently from the way any other network has ever done it, but  it’s because of that strategy that it seems to work so well. No other  network has such a seamless feel to its programming, which is obviously  by design. It allows for the taking of chances — exhibit A being Arrow, which was a genuine risk four years back, and exhibit B being Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,  perhaps the freshest and most original show to debut on broadcast  television in years — that other networks are too big or too beholden to  ratings and numbers to try. The CW has no such restrictions, which makes its operation almost  refreshing, and quite a bit of fun to watch, regardless of your age." False link

We meet one of them — Tobias Church (Chad L. Coleman) — in “Legacy,” and he’s all kinds of evil-awesome. Another baddie, Prometheus, seems to be in the mix as well. Who he (?) is and what he wants, we’ll be finding out over the next few episodes. 3. Killing is back on the menu.You know how Oliver hasn’t been doing much in the way of killing over the past couple of years? Yeah, that’s over with.

How will that mindset affect his relationships and the way he functions as a hero? Wendy Mericle: It’s complicated. As we know from Seasons 1 and 2, that is a huge decision, to go back to his old ways, to go back to his use of lethal force. Again, I think this speaks to the threat that Damien Darhk presented and … Laurel died. What they’re taking on as vigilantes is a serious business. People can die out there. And as he says in the premiere, if he’s not willing to go to that place, he shouldn’t be out there at all. So I think it really sets up the framework for this season. He’s going to be looking back at what he’s done and what he’s accomplished and he’s assessing that. But he’s also looking forward to think about, ‘What is my legacy going to be? Is it going to be the legacy of a hero, or the legacy of a murderer?’ With all that on his mind, how will Oliver struggle to balance his responsibilities as the mayor with what he wants to accomplish as the Green Arrow? Mericle: That’s really the front of the season. He actually has responsibilities and can’t run away from them. In Season 2 he was the CEO of Queen Consolidated, and yet it was a job [where] he could, because his name was on the building, get away with not being the most focused CEO. But when you’re the mayor, you’re in the public eye. There’s a lot more scrutiny. So it creates a lot of problems for us in the writers’ room, which is a lot of fun to figure out how he’s going to be in both places at once, and also, to play with visions of identity. I think the other thing it speaks to is the character. Oliver’s really more evolved than Season 1. He’s trying to be more responsible and, again, he’s trying to think about his legacy and whether he’s more effective as the mayor or as Green Arrow. More: (x)Really interesting interview (ignoring the LL bits, that is… I know I did!). I truly do think the climax to this season will involve Oliver revealing himself as the Green Arrow to Star City. Tho there’s a chance of Prometheus doing it for him, I think it’d show more character development for him to own it himself. We’ll see! " False link

This is a very “Supergirl” Big Bad.Aliens? REALLY? For Arrow’s 100th episode we get… ALIENS?Originally posted by somerand0mgirlIt is what it is. I mean, I got the gist from SDCC this year, off cast reactions about the 100th (particularly Stephen’s) that this would be a bit on the meh side. And I do trust that they’re going to TRY. Hence bringing in Robert and having Deathstroke (holding out for that to be Earth 2 Ollie not so dead but being all evil) and tying it back to the themes of legacy. But… ALIENS? Uhm…. yeah no. This pretty much guarantees that I will only be watching the Arrow portion of the crossover and any ALIENS that show up on that episode are gonna get some serious side eye from me. It’s just an episode. And clearly creating a lot of comic jerk-off buzz is more important than honoring the show that started all of this’ big milestone. If they’re expecting me to be SURPRISED that’s the case, they’re sadly mistaken. This is perfectly in line with what I know about how they want to market these shows. So whatever. It is what it is. " False link

Thea would absolutely want to stay, and Oliver would find himself forced to be the level headed one and insist that they can’t, even though he might want to stay, too. This being the 100th episode, bringing back characters not only makes sense but would make for a touching homage to characters loved and lost. Plus, this being the crossover - with time travel and universe jumping a distinct possibility - this may be the only chance the show will get to bring back these characters in a way that makes sense. It allows us to see them, but doesn’t give them a chance to be put back on the show permanently (which could strain credibility).    Plus, one episode deals would be easier to swing with busy actors.    Honestly, if anything like this actually did happen on the show, I’m not sure I’d ever stop crying. At the same time, I want it SO BAD. Thoughts? " False link

This is a great article and I enjoyed reading it when it floated across my Twitter Timeline.  Even though it’s not about Arrow or Olicity, it is about the “mindset” of trolls and haters and everyone should absolutely take 5 minutes out of their day to read it, not to be outraged at trollism (well, there’s that too) but getting WHY trolls do what they do, their goals, plus for the tips the ex-self-professed-troll gives for how to deal with trolls/haters. There aren’t many tips because the tips are basic and simple and yet (sometimes) realllllly hard to actually do, starting with:  “Lesson one: never feed a troll. “  The biggest take-aways in the article are learning what the troll is aiming for any why you should never give it to them.  They’re bored  They want attention  They want you to repost their comment to your followers. They want you  to write a blog post or status about them. They will use anything and  everything to get it. They will criticize you, post inflammatory  comments, or write remarks just to make you wonder how someone could be  so dumb. The problem is that you will feel compelled to respond to “set  things right.” Even if you respond in a cheerful or positive way, you’re  still feeding the troll.     Why is it so hard to just ignore trolls?  The article talks about that too. Emphasis is mine:  …the harsh reality is this: You will never beat a troll. You will never change a troll’s mind. You  may delude yourself into thinking that you proved them wrong, however,  never in my years of dealing with trolls have I seen a troll lay down  his or her arms and say, “You know what, you’re right. I was so wrong.”   And this is why the only response to a troll/hater is to Report when appropriate, block them, instantly forget about them, and immediately go back to focusing on stuff you love by posting a ton of great content that you love. Or as the article puts it:  “Stick with the people who love you and don’t spend a single second on the rest.”  " False link

Finally some info on Diggle. I LOVE that they are putting Diggle in Oliver’s Season 1 shoes and are paralleling the two men. It’s really going to be a great shift to see Oliver being the conscience and moral compass for Diggle. Not too much new on the Olicity front. More about leaving them ambiguous and how it’ll take awhile for them to sort out what they want from each other. Personally, I’m looking forward to the sorting out. That’s half the fun. This boyfriend sounds interesting. Is it Barry? I don’t think this interview necessarily eliminates Barry, but let’s just say it’s not Barry. Truly, I don’t think it matters. This interview, in conjunction with the TVLine spoilers, give us a clue of Felicity’s frame of mind. She’s obviously still dealing with the fallout from Havenrock and they made a specific point of mentioning that the bunker is really all she has in her life. So, this boyfriend could be an outlet for Felicity. Something beyond Havenrock, Oliver, the team and Palmer Tech that gives her a reprieve of sorts. He’s a person who has nothing to do with any of the things that are causing her limbo. That might be extremely appealing to Felicity at this point in time.  When Felicity is having a difficult time, she runs. She withdraws. She avoids. This boyfriend is the perfect escape. But when you take a step back, it means this boyfriend is outside of her real life in almost every way that matters. So… where does that leave them? Whole lotta nowhere. She can’t escape her problems. She has to face them… that’s the only way she’ll ever be happy. That’s an interesting emotional arc to take Felicity on and it’s one that’s very different from Ray Palmer.  ALL OF THIS. Whoever this bf is, he is an ESCAPE. I hope he’s a happy escape. I want this guy to make Felicity feel loved and important. Spoil her. BE HER ESCAPE. And then when she breaks (because she WILL) and he can’t/doesn’t know how to help her, Oliver will step in and it will come full circle. I am not only NOT worried, I am excited about the idea.Originally posted by justalittletumblweedI am so happy to find people who aren’t a) panicking about the boyfriend thing b) enraged about the boyfriend thing c) think the show expects we’ll be rooting for the boyfriend (SO not what that meant, btw) d) worry the show thinks Olicity won’t have chemistry e) all of the above or f) some other combination of concerns and worries that are completely unnecessary. People are allowed to feel how they wanna feel, of course, but I’m also allowed to feel how I wanna feel and right now, I wanna be surrounded by folks who are on the same page as me. Cuz I’m old, it’s summer, the Olympics are on, s5 is sounding awesome, and I’ve got nothing but hope for what’s to come. So… YES and THANK YOU to both of you for continuing to be the sorts of people I wanna chill with. 👍" False link

I did a thing. I wrote an open letter to Marc, Wendy, all the Arrow writers, cast and crew. Essentially, it’s a thank you note. I have to say I was anticipating some anger about Laurel’s death, but the level of vitriol Marc, Wendy and the cast/crew received was shocking to me. So, I wanted to take a moment, let them know what this show means to me and thank them. I don’t know if they will read this, but my goal was to infuse a little positivity back into the public discourse. I also wanted to let you all know how much you mean to me as well. If you wouldn’t mind taking a minute and reading the letter it would mean so much to me. I love you all! " False link
