He would make it a goal to have you leave practice feeling happy and good about yourself, meaning lots of praises and compliments so 24/7 flirting. Seokmin would be super nice and gentle when it came to criticism, he would give you his honest opinion but would make sure you weren’t offended by what he said. If this giant puppy did happen to ever so slightly offend you, you can bet that he would smother you in a giant hug. | “WAIT Y/N I DIDN’T MEAN IT LIKE THAT” “It’s fine” “IT’S CLEARLY NOT FINE. COME. HUG ME [refer to gif]” “I don’t want to, plus I’m sweaty from practice” “THAT’S WHY THEY INVENTED SHOWERS NOW COME HERE” Mingyu:As the unofficial official mother of the group, his motherly side would kick in. He would constantly visit you to see if you’re eating properly, drinking enough water, taking enough breaks, generally if you were still alive. If you ever dared to practice on an empty stomach, you can bet that he would show up with food he made just for you and if you were to ask him about it, he would just say they had “a lot of leftovers”. Since you didn’t want him to just sit there as you ate, you had him eat as well. So it would always turn into a late night dinner date sort of thing. There would be days where he would have to make sure you weren’t pushing yourself too far since he didn’t want you to strain yourself. | “Do you think I’m ever gonna debut?” “Don’t think like that, you’ve been working hard and they see that” “But-” “There are no buts ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) under my roof, everyone knows how hard you work and I know you’ll become a very successful idol after you debut” Minghao:Okay here we go. This insanely talented dancer would basically be your teacher since you go to him for help more than your actual instructor, which he didn’t mind one bit. I can see you two getting quite competitive and a normal late night practice session would quickly turn into a freestyle battle which would leave you two laying on the floor, exhausted. You two would both look forward to spending time together but wouldn’t show it. I see him being the sarcastic and sassy best friend who would manage to cheer you up even if you weren’t even down to begin with. He would, without fail, impress you with his dancing but by also flirting as he did so. | [refers to gif] “You’re such a flirt” “I don’t know what you’re talking about” honestly his name should be minghow cause he’s hurting me so muchSeungkwan:This pure bean would be more than happy to help you. He would find time spent with you the most stress relieving thing ever and would enjoy them so much. If you were ever feeling stress, he would bust out a random dance for you just to get you laughing. If you were ever feeling down, he would hesitantly do aegyo which would only result in him screaming at his own actions poor baby, that being the thing to cheer you up. Honestly, I can see Seungkwan being that helpful and supportive friend who would cheer you on even if it was just you two in the dance studio. If anything, you would be practicing by yourself first and he would just sit back and watch you with the softest expression ever. | “I have so much to improve on” “Really? Don’t you think you’re pushing yourself too much?” “What do you mean?” “Well, just from watching, I don’t see anything wrong. You’re perfect”Vernon:This living meme. I think his crush started when he first heard music down the hall and was curious enough to see who it was, only to find you half heartily rapping along to one of his verses while on your phone or something.   It stunned him with how calm and relaxed you were as you rapped/sung along to the song. He would be shy and awkward but add you to the equation and you have yourself a constantly blushing mess. Eventually this poor child would learn how to hide his emotions better and would be able to act somewhat calm around you. You two would bond over your clumsiness, whether that was only in the dance studio or just your general life, you two were clumsy.   | “How’d you get that new bruise?” “I don’t know, I think this one was from walking into the door or it was when I fell off my bed..” “[laughing] This is amazing, I’m so glad I’m not the only clumsy one around here” “Oh shut up”Dino:This smol precious bean would try his hardest to be the most helpful he could possibly be. Stress would be chucked out of the door since he would try to make “Dino Lessons” as fun and as informative as possible, and honestly how could you be stressed when taking Dino Lessons. One second he’s cute Dino and the next he’s stage serious Lee Chan. If you were feeling a bit stressful, he would listen to you vent and just talk with you until you felt better. Overall, he would be a great listener, a great dancing partner, and a great friend. | “Why do you think we’re here?” “To practice..?” “No no, think bigger, why do you think we’re here? On Earth?” “Y/N, this is the third time today and fourth time this week. We’ve literally talked about this.” “I can’t help my existential crises, plus you’re the only one who listens to me” I hope you guys enjoyed this! I had lots of fun making this one ^^" True text
