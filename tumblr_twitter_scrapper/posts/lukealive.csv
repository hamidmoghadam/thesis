The Russian newspaper says it confirmed the news with government officials and an analyst of the region also confirmed the news to the Times with her own sources. Three men are known to have been murdered, although the real number is likely to be higher.  in almost every genocide, the first “act” is the rounding up and killing of a group of men, specifically.  In “root and branch” genocides they [”civilian men of ‘battle age’”] are often the first group to be separated out and massacred, paving the way for the murder of women, children, and elderly men. In more common articulations of genocide, however, they can be the only group slated for outright massacre, while women, children, and elderly men suffer a range of alternative fates involving rape, sexual exploitation, torture, forced maternity, murder, and expulsion. Gender and the Future of Genocide Studies and Prevention   as the rest of this article explains this isn’t to say that men have it worst in a genocide, but that it’s important when you see a very common red flag for genocide to pay attention to the “conflict” in case any more markers of an impending genocide occur.  the g word is really loaded and i’m not bringing this up because i want to start an avalanche of “CHECHNYA IS COMMITTING GENOCIDE AGAINST GAY PEOPLE” fear mongering (that is the absolute last thing that i want). it’s just not possible to prevent any genocide without questioning whether a current conflict might eventually get there. and i do not think it’s nothing that genocide watch is reporting on this.  UPDATE 4/10/17 Chechnya has opened concentration camps for gay men   Gay men arrested in a ‘purge’ in the Russian region of Chechnya are being held in concentration camp-style prisons, reports have alleged. Early reports emerged earlier this month that gay people are being targeted in the region, which is part of Russia but has substantial autonomy. Russian newspapers and human rights groups report that more than 100 gay men have been detained “in connection with their non-traditional sexual orientation, or suspicion of such” as part of a purge. Several people were also reportedly feared dead following violent raids. In a chilling response, a Chechen government spokesperson denied that there are any gay people to detain, insisting that “you can’t detain and harass someone who doesn’t exist in the republic”. The Kremlin denied any knowledge of a purge. But reports have since emerged that the men arrested are being kept in horrific concentration camp prisons, where violent abuse and torture is common. Based on interviews with eyewitnesses and survivors, Novaya Gazeta reports that a secret prison has been set up in the town of Argun to detain the men arrested in the purge. One man who was released from the camp told the newspaper that he was subjected to violent “interrogations” at the camp, as Chechen officials attempted to get him to confess the names and locations of more gay men. The officials also seized his mobile phone, targeting his network of contacts regardless of whether they were gay or not. The camp was reportedly set up by Chechen forces in a former military headquarters in the town. The newspaper reports allegations that the Speaker of the Parliament of Chechnya was among officials to visit the site, though the claims have not been substantiated. The detainees face electric shock torture and violent beatings, while some of them have been held to ransom and used to extort their families. Tanya Lokshina of Human Rights Watch wrote: “For several weeks now, a brutal campaign against LGBT people has been sweeping through Chechnya. She continued: “Law enforcement and security agency officials under control of the ruthless head of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, have rounded up dozens of men on suspicion of being gay, torturing and humiliating the victims. “Some of the men have forcibly disappeared. Others were returned to their families barely alive from beatings. At least three men apparently have died since this brutal campaign began.” She added: “These days, very few people in Chechnya dare speak to human rights monitors or journalists even anonymously because the climate of fear is overwhelming and people have been largely intimidated into silence. “Filing an official complaint against local security officials is extremely dangerous, as retaliation by local authorities is practically inevitable. “It is difficult to overstate just how vulnerable LGBT people are in Chechnya, where homophobia is intense and rampant. “LGBT people are in danger not only of persecution by the authorities but also of falling victim to ‘honour killings’ by their own relatives for tarnishing family honour.” What Can We Do?   Alexander Artmyev from Amnesty International spoke to Metro.co.uk. He said that people who are not in Russia can help by joining the charity’s Urgent Action on Chechnya. The action encourages people to write in Russian or your own language to Chairman of the Investigation Committee and Acting Head of the Investigation Committee for the Chechen Republic. Amnesty has also asked the letter, which should ask for an investigation and appeal for protection for LGBT individuals, to be copied into Human Rights groups and diplomatic missions from your country.

Holy shit you guys  This deserves to be read, so I’m copying the article into my reblog.   Kendall explains that she was born to be a  sex slave, as her parents intentionally had her for the trafficker she  calls her “owner.” Kendall says that her parents sold her at birth to an  elite pedophile ring that serviced some of the world’s power elite,  describing her first memories as being passed around groups of rich and  prominent men and women for them to “take turns” with her for sadistic  sexual pleasure. Making her first public appearance  after escaping from the man she calls her “owner,” Kendall describes  being forced to participate in actions that shock the conscience. She  explains that she was forced to rape children as young as 5- years-old,  and even admits to having been forced to kill a baby by the human  trafficker she describes as her “owner.”Kendall says that she can tell the difference between kids born into  sexual slavery and ones that have been kidnapped, as the ones born into  it are more docile and less upset as it is the only reality they have  ever known. When Dr. Phil asks how old she thinks she was when she was  first raped, Kendall explains that it was “before I could talk – I was used to it by the time I was 2.” She says she doesn’t even know her actual age, as she has been a sex slave her entire life, being trafficked around the globe to be molested and raped by the societal elites – including high ranking law enforcement official, major sports franchise owners and even high level U.S. politicians. She describes having birthed 3 children while in captivity, all of which have been taken from her by her owner/trafficker, and are believed by Kendall to now be child sex slaves themselves. “I was allowed to get pregnant, because men paid for that,” Kendall said. Kendall notes that the pedophiles she  came into contact with over the years were extremely wealthy – often  “pillars of the community” – with some even owning private islands or  large pieces of land. “They would buy us just to hunt us,” she said.  She recalls one of her most fearful  memories was that of the pedophiles hosting a “hunting party” on one of  their large private plots of lands, making numerous children run and  hide in fear, as they were the “prey” to be hunted. The pedophiles would  then hunt the children as they ran and hid in fear – raping and  torturing them when they were captured. The activities described by this woman  are so profoundly disturbing they can be almost hard to believe, but Dr.  Phil confirms that his team not only investigated Kendall’s case for  four months, but also consulted with law enforcement experts who  confirmed her story. Dr. Phil said he “100% believes” that she is  telling the truth. In a damning indictment of the power-elite, Kendall described how the  pedophile politicians would adorn her in designer clothes, well groomed  hair and makeup to give the appearance of class and sophistication. She  explains that she and other children were often hung from cages  suspended from the ceiling, and that they were often drugged before  being transported in the darkness of night. She claims that she was trafficked to pedophile politicians, and  taken to political parties attended by high-level politicians who used  her for their personal pleasure. The politicians always took great care  to hide what they were doing, according to Kendall, who confirmed  that there are many elite U.S. politicians that have been engaged in  raping children for many years — a reality that has consistently been  covered up and completely hidden from voters. Perhaps the reason these crimes have been so steadfastly hidden from  public view, is that high-level law enforcement officials have also been  implicated as being part of the elite pedophile network. This is just the latest case to emerge in what is now being called  #PedoGate. #PedoGate refers to an international pedophile ring composed  of politicians and other high profile societal elites. After President Trump held a press conference last month, in which he  detailed his plans to go after the victims of the “human trafficking  epidemic,” former U.S. Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney weighed in on the subject,  noting that going after child predators will lead to the downfall of  both Republicans and Democrats in the United States — as this problem  goes all the way to the top.  As the Free Thought Project has consistently pointed out, pedophilia among the global elite is rampant.  In December, we reported on the massive child sex ring that was exposed in Norway. That investigation quickly led to arrests  of “51 people, all men, (who) are so far involved in the case. 24 of  them come from Hordaland and Sogn og Fjordane. Twenty-six come from  other areas of Norway, from Southeast to Finnmark in the north. Among  the accused offenders, there is also one Swedish national. Two  politicians, one Labor politician from Oslo and a former national  Progress Party (FrP) politician from Eastern Norway are involved in the  case.” One is also a kindergarten teacher, and four of the 51 arrested  were perpetrators in the video evidence collected. In February, the Free Thought Project reported on the fact that the police chief recently came forward and confirmed that the former Prime Minister of England, Sir Edward Heath, had raped dozens of children. The department also noted how those within the government helped cover up these crimes. We previously reported on the high-profile elite pedophilia scandal that gripped the U.K.  – with its thousands of victims – being unceremoniously swept under the  rug, which is indicative of the scope and breadth of the actual  problem. In fact, the problem is so rampant in England that officials  issued an order last month to stop naming streets and landmarks after  local heroes and politicians because they could later be exposed as  pedophiles. In the case of the U.K. Inquiry, historical abuse by politically connected elites, celebrities, and politicians was brought to light  — with an official inquiry being started — only to have the inquiry  “crumble” after heavy pressure was exerted by highly placed power  brokers within the U.K. establishment. This was almost the exact same scenario as what took place in the United States in what became known as the Franklin child sex ring coverup  — which involved high level Republicans during the George H.W. Bush  administration. Once the FBI took over the investigation from state  authorities, it turned into a witch hunt to persecute the child victims –  going so far as to charge them with perjury in a successful attempt to  scare the other 70+ victims to recant their testimony regarding the  child sex ring. While the story received a small  measure of newspaper coverage, there was a complete blackout of the  scandal by the mass media, thus most Americans have never heard about  this scandal that reached all the way to the White House. Domestically, there are relatively few high-level arrests, as anytime  ‘the elite’ are mentioned alongside the term ‘pedophile,’ the  Praetorian guard, aka the corporate media, shout down all those who dare  pose any questions about those in power abusing the most vulnerable  among us. For example former U.S. Speaker of the House of Representatives, Dennis Hastert, a known serial child rapist, was never charged for his numerous crimes against children, which the FBI knew about, and had evidence of, for over a decade. According to FBI whistleblower Sibel Edmonds: Since 1996 the FBI has had tons of information on Hastert  which was gathered in Chicago by the FBI’s Chicago Field Office. The  incriminating criminal evidence in those files range from bribery,  extortion, fraud, money laundering and embezzlement, to sexual crimes  against minors and participation in foreign-operated drug operations. Since 1997 the FBI has had much hard evidence on Hastert gathered by  the FBI’s Washington Field Office. The documented deeds range from  espionage to foreign bribery. But that’s not all. The FBI also has had hard data on Hastert’s  sexual violations outside the United States. The involved countries  include Vietnam, Thailand, Turkey and Morocco, among others. This also  included sexual favors as means of foreign bribery. Interestingly, the  CIA had been documenting those sexual activities for many years, and not  only on Hastert but on many others; elected and appointed. So, when corporate media tells you #PizzaGate is fake news and that  investigating whether Denny Hastert’s good friend, John Podesta, is  involved in some way with pedophilia – given his close friendship with  Hastert, proclivity for strange art featuring nude children and strange  code words found in his leaked emails — it shouldn’t be shouted down as  “fake news,” but investigated instead. It seems that American politicians and their political cronies are  virtually untouchable in the ivory towers of government. Since January  of 2017 over 1,500 pedophiles and human traffickers have been arrested.  However, the power-elite operating these child sexual slavery rings have  not been among them… yet.  Here are the YouTube videos embedded in the article:   Woman Claims Parents Sold Her To An International Sex Trafficking Organization – At Birth – The Dr. Phil Show   Woman Claims Parents Sold Her To Sex Trafficker And Said ‘It Was The Best Thing For Me’    – The Dr. Phil Show  Reported Human Trafficking Survivor Claims She Was Forced To Have Sex Before She Could Talk – The Dr. Phil Show   Why A Reported Survivor Of Sex Trafficking Claims She Was ‘Allowed’ To Get Pregnant Multiple Times – The Dr. Phil Show   Reported Survivor Of Human Trafficking Ring Claims Some Clients ‘Would Buy Us Just To Hunt Us’ – The Dr. Phil Show   Dr Phil - March 21, 2017 - Child Trafficking Victim Comes Forward – The Silentist (full show, 42 min) BLOW THIS UP AND BURN IT ALL DOWN.

H.R. 861: To terminate the Environmental Protection Agency This bill — cosponsored by Republican members of Congress from fossil fuel-producing states — is just one sentence long, and says nothing about what would happen to the multiple environmental regulations the EPA has instituted since 1970, or its multibillion-dollar budget, or its thousands of staffers. H.R. 861 is currently awaiting action in the subcommittee on environment. 2. H.R. 610: Tax dollars for private schools Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) introduced this bill in January, which would redistribute funding earmarked for public schools in the form of vouchers for parents to send children to private schools. Over the long term, this would eventually bankrupt public schools, and create a stratified education system in which cash-strapped public schools would be unable to meet the educational needs of low-income students. The bill is awaiting action in the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. 3. H.R. 899: To terminate the Department of Education If this bill, introduced by Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Kentucky), becomes law, the U.S. Department of Education would terminate by the end of 2018. The bill’s brevity leaves many questions unanswered, like what would happen with Department of Education grants for public schools and universities, its budget, or its staff. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has said she would personally be “fine” if the agency she heads were to be abolished. 4. H.J.R. 69: To repeal a rule protecting wildlife Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska), whose constituents likely include hunters who kill wildlife for sport rather than for food, introduced this joint resolution voicing displeasure with a Department of Interior rule that prohibits “non-subsistence” hunting in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. The resolution passed the House and is awaiting action in the Senate. 5. H.R. 370: To repeal the Affordable Care Act While President Obama was in office, House Republicans voted at least 60 times to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act — also known as Obamacare — despite its futility. However, the Trump administration has made the repeal of Obamacare a top priority, meaning the repeal bill from Rep. Bill Flores (R-Texas) is likely to pass. 6. H.R. 354: To defund Planned Parenthood Despite the widely publicized debunking of the video alleging the women’s health nonprofit was selling human organs, Republicans are still refusing to stop destroying Planned Parenthood. Rep. Diane Black (R-Tennessee) introduced a bill that would prevent any federal grants from going to Planned Parenthood for a full year unless they swore to not perform abortions. As the chart below from Planned Parenthood shows, only 3 percent of Planned Parenthood resources go toward abortions, while the vast majority of funding is used to help low-income women get STD tests, contraceptive care, and breast cancer screenings: 7. H.R. 785: National Right-to-Work legislation Conservative ideologue Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) is aiming to cripple unions at the nationwide level with a bill that would systematically deprive labor unions of the funding they need to operate. Unions often provide one of the crucial pillars of support for Democratic candidates and causes, and conservatives aim to destroy them once and for all by going after their funding. It’s important to note that right-to-work is bad for all workers, not just union members — in 2015, the Economic Policy Institute learned that wages in right-to-work states are roughly 3.2 percent lower than in non-right-to-work states. 8. H.R. 83: Mobilizing Against Sanctuary Cities Act Multiple cities and states around the country have openly stated that they won’t abide by President Trump’s plan to aggressively round up and deport undocumented immigrants. A bill by Rep. Lou Barletta (R-Pennsylvania) would strip all federal funding of any city that doesn’t obey Trump’s immigration policies for up to a year. 9. H.R. 147: To criminalize abortion Rep. Trent Franks (R-Arizona) wants to aggressively prosecute pregnant women seeking abortions, along with abortion providers, by making abortion a felony punishable by up to five years in prison. The bill is currently awaiting action in the Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice.

On Wednesday, the massive adult entertainment destination took the  somewhat surprising step of launching the “Pornhub Sexual Health  Center.”  They’re hoping the free sub-site  will become a go-to resource for some of their 70 million daily users  on all manner of topics, including STIs, sexual safety and how to manage  relationships. They’ve chosen Dr. Laurie Betito, a renowned sex therapist, to direct  the site and they’ll also be working with a number of doctors,  therapists and other experts to offer advice and answer questions.  Corey  Price, Pornhub’s Vice President, told Mashable, “Our goal is  to provide our visitors with a site that has credible and insightful  information, rather than have them scouring the internet.” While it’s a database they’ll build up over time, a first look  reveals they’ve started with the fundamentals — with answers to things  like “Babies. Where do they come from?” and “Are there really three  holes?”  These might seems almost laughably basic to adult consumers of  hardcore porn, but there are a lot of young people for whom these are  very real questions.  Price told Mashable they weren’t aiming the content  specifically at beginners.  He said they simply want to appeal to “those  who are looking for trustworthy sex tips and health advice provided by  experts.”  But it seems like they realize this could prove to be an  especially valuable resource for their younger audience, who most likely  isn’t getting comprehensive (much less sex-positive) sex ed in schools. There are, of course, plenty of online sexual health and education  resources, but for many kids, landing on sites like Pornhub is already  their way into learning about sex.  Porn can obviously teach you plenty  about the basics and mechanics of intercourse, but there’s a whole range  of other things — biology, health, consent, relating to intimate  partners, just to name a few — that you won’t pick up from watching  videos like “Big tits round asses” or “Sloppy throat games.”  So if they can slide their curious audience over to the PSHC while  they’re already on the site, it could function as pretty useful one-stop  shop for filling in the blanks left by spotty sex ed classes and the  birds and bees talks given by often bewildered parents.   Neat!  Holy shit their section on trans people was actually really good and not what I expected from something hosted by a porn site! If they had a containing various sexualities and whatnot as well, they’ll definitely have a good resource on their hands!  This… is great.  Didn’t pornhub also do that thing were like they planted one tree for every hundred videos watched or something?? Pornhub is the very sexual but kind hearted and caring mom friend in every group  You’ve heard of Mom friends. PornHub is the MILF friend. " False link

As Speaker John Boehner has said, the poor have a notion that “I really don’t have to work. I don’t really want to do this. I think I’d rather just sit around.” In  reality, a large and growing share of the nation’s poor work full time  – sometimes sixty or more hours a week – yet still don’t earn enough  to lift themselves and their families out of poverty.   It’s also commonly believed, especially among Republicans, that the rich deserve their wealth because they work harder than others.  In reality, a large and growing portion of the super-rich have never broken a sweat. Their wealth has been handed to them.  The  rise of these two groups – the working poor and non-working rich – is  relatively new. Both are challenging the core American assumptions that  people are paid what they’re worth, and work is justly rewarded. Why are these two groups growing? The ranks of the working poor are growing because wages at the bottom have dropped,  adjusted for inflation. With increasing numbers of Americans taking  low-paying jobs in retail sales, restaurants, hotels, hospitals,  childcare, elder care, and other personal services, the pay of the  bottom fifth is falling closer to the minimum wage. At the same time, the real value of the federal minimum wage is lower today than it was a quarter century ago.  In addition, most recipients of public assistance must now work in order to qualify.  Bill  Clinton’s welfare reform of 1996 pushed the poor off welfare and into  work. Meanwhile, the Earned Income Tax Credit, a wage subsidy, has  emerged as the nation’s largest anti-poverty program. Here, too, having a  job is a prerequisite.  The new work requirements haven’t reduced  the number or percentage of Americans in poverty. They’ve just moved  poor people from being unemployed and impoverished to being employed and  impoverished. A very clever scheme by Republicans. While poverty declined in the early years of  welfare reform when the economy boomed and jobs were plentiful, it began  growing in 2000. By 2012 it exceeded its level in 1996, when welfare ended. At  the same time, the ranks of the non-working rich have been swelling.  America’s legendary “self-made” men and women are fast being replaced by  wealthy heirs.  Six of today’s ten wealthiest Americans are heirs  to prominent fortunes. The Walmart heirs alone have more wealth than  the bottom 40 percent of Americans combined. Americans  who became enormously wealthy over the last three decades are now  busily transferring that wealth to their children and grand children. The nation is on the cusp of the largest inter-generational transfer of wealth in history. A study  from the Boston College Center on Wealth and Philanthropy projects a  total of $59 trillion passed down to heirs between 2007 and 2061. As  the French economist Thomas Piketty reminds us, this is the kind of  dynastic wealth that’s kept Europe’s aristocracy going for centuries.  It’s about to become the major source of income for a new American  aristocracy. This is what the Koch/Walton Republicans have schemed for; the Gilded Age. The tax code encourages all this by favoring unearned income over earned income.  The  top tax rate paid by America’s wealthy on their capital gains – the  major source of income for the non-working rich – has dropped from 33  percent in the late 1980s to 20 percent today, putting it substantially  below the top tax rate on ordinary income (36.9 percent). If the owners of capital assets whose worth increases over their lifetime hold them until death, their heirs pay zero capital gains taxes on them. Such “unrealized” gains now account for more than half the value of assets held by estates worth more than $100 million. At  the same time, the estate tax has been slashed. Before George W. Bush  was president, it applied to assets in excess of $2 million per couple  at a rate of 55 percent. Now it kicks in at $10,680,000 per couple, at a  40 percent rate. Last year only 1.4 out of every 1,000 estates owed any estate tax, and the effective rate they paid was only 17 percent. Republicans  now in control of Congress want to go even further. Last Friday the  Senate voted 54-46 in favor of a non-binding resolution to repeal the  estate tax altogether. Earlier in the week, the House Ways and Means  Committee also voted for a repeal. The House is expected to vote in  coming weeks. Yet the specter of an entire generation doing  nothing for their money other than speed-dialing their wealth management  advisers is not particularly attractive. It puts more and more  responsibility for investing a substantial portion of the nation’s  assets into the hands of people who have never worked. It also endangers our democracy, as dynastic wealth inevitably and invariably accumulates political influence and power. Consider  the rise of both the working poor and the non-working rich, and the  meritocratic ideal on which America’s growing inequality is often  justified doesn’t hold up. That widening inequality – combined  with the increasing numbers of people who work full time but are still  impoverished and of others who have never worked and are fabulously  wealthy – is undermining the moral foundations of American capitalism.  Just pointing out real quick that the moral foundation of American capitalism is enslaving human beings.  The actual info here is on point though. Organize! " False link

The potential new vaccine will be tested on 600 people in North America, to see how well it can prevent them from getting the virus. Before we get too excited, the phase I trials were only set up to show that the vaccine was tolerated well by the human body - they didn’t demonstrate if it actually works as a preventative treatment. But the team saw promising results, with the vaccine triggering an immune response in the HIV-positive patients it was tested on. “We were very excited with the phase I results,” said team leader Chil-Yong Kang, from Western University in Canada. “The trial demonstrated that our vaccine stimulates broadly neutralising antibodies that will neutralise not only single sub-types of HIV, but other sub-types, which means that you can have the vaccine cover many different strains of the virus.” The results of that trial have been published this week in the journal Retrovirology, and the researchers have announced that they’ve received regulatory approval to take the vaccine development to the next level as early as September next year.

The Globe has written extensively on the use of solitary confinement in Canada, including the 2010 death of Eddie Snowshoe after 162 consecutive days in segregation, and the more recent plight of Adam Capay, who was isolated in an acrylic glass-lined cell for more than four years without trial. The United Nations has said more than 15 days in solitary confinement constitutes torture.  Continue Reading. " False link
