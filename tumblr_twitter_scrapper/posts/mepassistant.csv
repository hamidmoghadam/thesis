Brussels never likes when the outcome of something is not predictable, especially when it knows that the debate around it is going to be filled with demagogic lies, but that’s democracy.Should the UK leave the EU, it will clearly be challenging for the EU to deal with that (and even more for the UK), but it wouldn’t be as if it was a country like Germany or France (which are completely European and integrated) which was leaving. The UK always had a peculiar place within the EU : part of it without being completely in.But after that, it could also give a boost to the European project, since the most Eurosceptic country will be out of the way.Either way, we’ll make do, as usual."

Someone contacted me to do the translation stuff I talked about a few days back. I’m glad to say that I hired him/her, thanks to the quality of his/her application (the fact that he/she was the only one to apply has nothing to do with my decision… Or not). Anyway, here’s the plan : the hired person (whose identity is unknown, for obvious reason) should create a tumblr account and contact me through it. That way we’ll be able to discuss privately. To make sure that it is the correct person, please tell me in your coming message what are your top qualities according to the application you sent me :) Thanks ! (for the others, feel free to contact me too, I’m always glad to discuss or help any way I can ;) )" True text
