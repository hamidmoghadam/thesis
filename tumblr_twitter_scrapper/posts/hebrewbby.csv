I told a car full of women one time that I refused to be in another relationship until I met a man who was capable of making his own doctors’ appointments and washing the dishes.

She never saw combat, never shot any children, and certainly did not have kill notches on her rifle. She did not brag about killing Palestinians. She did not say “I want them all dead.”She did make a post in 2014 that supported people in the IDF for “protecting my country against the horrific acts conducted by Hamas, who are hiding like cowards behind women and children” and tagged it with a few phrases including #loveidf and #coexistence. Now, again, maybe her support is antithetical to your beliefs, and I’m not here to lecture you on that. But no, she did not post anything about “praying for Palestinians to die quickly” or brag about killing people’s families. If her actual involvement with and statements about the IDF are things you find unsavoury, then fine; but if that’s the case, then you shouldn’t need to make up lies that evoke historical anti-Semitism to drive home your points. The things you oppose should hold up as they already are—otherwise, you’re effectively conceding that the things you don’t like aren’t bad enough to warrant your reaction on their own. For example, I don’t like the football player Luis Suarez because, despite being a talented goalscorer, he has a weird, creepy history of biting his opponents during matches. Now, this is a total valid reason not to like a professional athlete, so I have no cause to gild the lily. I don’t need to say “Well, actually I don’t like Luis Suarez because when he was at Liverpool he ate a Manchester United player’s liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti,” because his actual behaviour is aggressive, unprofessional, and straight up bizarre—meaning I don’t need to embellish the truth in order to be justified in how I feel about him. If you think serving in the IDF is bad, then just say “I don’t like Gal Godot because I think serving in the IDF is bad.” Don’t make shit up, don’t exaggerate the truth. Otherwise it looks an awful lot like you’re deliberately going out of your way to insinuate that Jewish people are evil child murderers, which says a lot more about you than it does about Gal Godot. On that note, please make sure that you are also holding Adam Driver accountable with equal gusto for serving in the Marine Corps and continually supporting the U.S. armed forces by boycotting the new Star Wars movies. Again, you are totally entitled to dislike the military, especially in relation to conflicts ongoing conflicts that have had horrible effects on the Middle East, but not when it’s only against the j00z and nobody else. " False text

(I had some words when this first happened.)Critics and fans who take issue with this story are told to “wait and see,” dismissed as bullies, and/or parodied with a group of “social justice warrior” villains in writer Nick Spencer’s other Marvel vehicle, Captain America: Sam Wilson. (Bonus: a black character apologizes to a white character for being a civil rights activist. Wow.)Rare Jewish comic book character and in-universe Holocaust survivor Magneto – also created by Jewish men – joins Hydra.It’s revealed that in the Marvel Universe’s original timeline, the Allies actually lost the war, and the good guys used a Cosmic Cube to ensure victory (but apparently considered the death of 11 million people in concentration camps, including 6 million Jews, to be acceptable losses, yet should still be viewed as “the good guys”).Hydra Cap is pictured holding Thor’s hammer, implying that despite his Hydra affiliation he somehow remains worthy. It’s worth noting here that Norse mythology and iconography like Thor’s hammer is a particular favorite with white supremacist groups.Perhaps worst of all, Marvel decides to drum up excitement over Secret Empire with a “fun” marketing campaign wherein comic book store employees wear exclusive Hydra shirts. Because who doesn’t love being blindsided by low-key Nazi cosplay on a Wednesday afternoon?In the meantime, Marvel sales have slumped precipitously, which their Senior VP of Sales and Market tried to blame on “diversity,” a statement which doesn’t hold up under any kind of scrutiny and which he eventually wound up walking back on after many, many fans and retailers pointed that out.But something’s up. Because like I said, I’ve been reading comics a long time, and I’ve never seen this kind of flop sweat coming off a publisher before.An actually in-character Steve Rogers.The statement from Marvel, released through their sister company ABC News, reads: “At Marvel, we want to assure all of our fans that we hear your concerns about aligning Captain America with Hydra and we politely ask you to allow the story to unfold before coming to any conclusion.”This is disingenuous at best. Because sure, we’re allowing the story to unfold. We can’t very well do anything else. This is Marvel’s story, and we do have to wait until it ends. That’s not Marvel’s problem.Marvel’s problem is that we’re not buying the story.Again, Marvel’s sales are dropping. Though the (deliberately?) leaked reveal at the end of Captain America: Steve Rogers #1 back in May 2016 used controversy to drive sales up to nearly 100K and went to a second printing, six months later the book had dropped down to 48K. Four issues were released in January and February of this year, and each one came in with smaller sales: Steve Rogers #9 sold 42K, #10 40K, #11 36K, and #12 32K. Some of this is normal attrition – every book sees a spike in sales with #1 and a slow decline month on month – but this is far more precipitous than Steve’s similarly declining companion book Captain America: Sam Wilson, which went from 27K last May to 22K in November to 18K this February.Anecdotal evidence suggests that retailers aren’t on board with the storyline, nor are their customers – one retailer told CBR’s Kieran Shiach that out of 200 customers with pull lists, only one has subscribed to Steve Rogers. Marvel (and DC, for that matter) depends on the success of their crossover events to keep them in the black, but with sales of the main series leading into Secret Empire declining and fan response so negative, it’s no surprise that Marvel is concerned about reader antipathy right now. Especially when keeping up with Secret Empire would cost readers $17 for four comics in just the first week.Again, this is anecdotal, but every Steve Rogers fan I know – and I have a Tumblr, I know a lot of them – has dropped the book until this is over. They are, in fact, doing exactly what Marvel has asked: waiting until the story ends.That’s not what Marvel wants. Marvel wants us to pay $3.99 a month for Captain America: Steve Rogers and $4.99 a month for Secret Empire and god only knows how much for all the various one-shots and tie-ins until this disaster is over. They’ve heard “your story is offensive and bad” and their response is, inexplicably, “We hear you. Please continue to give us at least $9 every month until we decide to stop telling it. Do not tell us what you think of it in the meantime (unless you choose to praise us).”This, by the way, is from a company that regularly cancels critically lauded books like Mockingbird before the first trade – a perfect chance to read a complete story and draw a conclusion – is released. From a company whose entire business model is predicated on preorders, in an industry which regularly tells readers “This book you liked failed because you didn’t get enough of your friends to agree to pay for it sight unseen.”In other words, according to Marvel, you must agree to give them money before you know if you’ll like a book, and you cannot stop once you know that you don’t. Because somehow that wouldn’t be fair?I don’t know why Marvel chose to make this particular statement at this particular time. Was it just because of declining sales? Their choice to release it through a mainstream outlet instead of an industry site – one owned by their parent company, no less – suggests to me that this may have been mandated by their corporate overlord Disney, which is probably none too happy that Marvel’s tarnishing such a valuable piece of IP. Because for all the hairs Spencer and his supporters have been splitting between Hydra and Nazis, to the mainstream audience (and anyone who can comprehend a metaphor), Hydra are Nazis. And the mainstream audience might not buy a lot of comics, but they sure do buy movie tickets. And Captain America shirts, hats, mugs, backpacks, lunchboxes, action figures…Maybe Marvel’s hoping that this message of “Steve will be a good guy in the end, please keep giving us money” will mollify everyone, or at least everyone except those whiny Jews (like me). But if Marvel really wants to win back goodwill, here’s what I suggest they do:Apologize.Cancel Secret Empire. Put the Cap books on hiatus until you can whip up a quick “It was all a dream!” explanation to wrap up this nonsense. Let the rest of the line chug along sans crossovers. Stop letting your writer use his following on Twitter to sic his fans on critics and then claim that he’s the victim. Above all, don’t plaster your website – and retailers’ bodies – with “Hail Hydra,” a phrase that is obviously meant to evoke “Heil Hitler,” and then play dumb when readers call it Nazi propaganda!I know they’re not going to do any of this. I know that many of these comics have been scripted, drawn, printed, even released. It would mean taking a huge financial hit, and it would be an embarrassing, massive, public admission of wrongdoing.That’s fine. You keep right on keeping on, Marvel. I’ll allow the story to unfold. I’ll wait to draw my conclusion.But don’t insult me and then demand that I pay for the privilege." False link

But my ancestors were buried there for generations,” Bulka told Haaretz last week. “I have at least 150 relatives buried there and I wanted to visit their graves to say Kaddish [the mourner’s prayer].”But at the local cemetery, where Jews had been buried since the 18th century, he was greeted by vandalized graves and piles of rocks that had once been gravestones. Despite his efforts, he was unable to locate even a single relative’s grave.A local man who was walking his dog pointed him to a site in the distance where, the man said, he would find “Jewish graves.” When Bulka got to the site, his heart nearly stopped. The “graves” were pieces of Jewish gravestones that had been used as stones to build the wall around the town’s Christian cemetery. Bulka, a religious man, was furious. “It was a disgrace,” he says.Upon returning from his trip, Bulka, 50, a resident of Sha’arei Tikva, began researching the fate of the Jewish graves markers, discovering that they had been uprooted around 1959, when the Communists ruled. Photos he located with the help of a local blogger document the desecration of the cemetery. Along with photos of the gravestones being uprooted, one can also see that some were incorporated into a playground for local residents.In early 2016, a few months after his first visit to the city, Bulka went back to Ostrowiec to meet the mayor. His first, unequivocal demand was that the gravestones be removed from the wall of the Christian cemetery. “I won’t rest until these markers are safely returned,” he told the mayor.He came to the meeting with a few concrete suggestions. One was to take the misappropriated gravestones and turn them into a memorial, with the help of Israeli teens who would visit the area during their trips to Poland. Another proposal was to send the stones to Israel.“There are a lot of suitable options, just so they don’t remain a wall in a Christian cemetery,” he said. “I tried to explain to the mayor that we see these monuments as holy objects, and as such Jewish law bans them from being used for any other purpose.”After consultations, the mayor agreed to remove the Jewish gravestones from the cemetery wall, on condition that Bulka fund the dismantling of the stones, their transport to another location and the rebuilding of the wall. He demanded half a million zloty, around 460,000 shekels (over $125,000).Bulka was astonished. “Not only do you take my people’s gravestones and use them for disrespectful purpose, you expect me to build you a new wall?” he asked. “There’s no reason for us to fund the construction of a wall for a Christian cemetery.”His frustration grew as all his appeals to organizations, agencies and private individuals who deal with the preservation of Jewish cemeteries refused to help or even answer his inquiries. “Apparently this town isn’t central enough or interesting enough to anyone whose family isn’t buried here,” he says, despairingly.A turning point came when he discovered that there are three properties in the town that are registered in its land registry as belonging to his family. “I have proof that for seven generations my family owned land there,” he says. “Since my whole family was murdered in the Holocaust, my family is the only heir to them.”Bulka hopes that now he has a bargaining chip with which to approach the city. “I will propose to the municipality that I will give up these properties if they give up the gravestones, a kind of barter,” he says.Deep down, however, he knows that Eastern European bureaucracy won’t exactly work in his favor and that while his plan looks logical on paper, it probably won’t lead to the “liberation of the gravestones,” as he puts it, in the near term, especially since until now he’s been working on his own.He is now looking for a person or organization with some resources to pursue his fight. “Every day that passes, the blasphemy there continues,” he says.The city of Ostrowiec Swietokrzyski did not respond to Haaretz’s request for a comment.On Yom HaShoah, it is important to remember that the antisemitism and dehumanization that allowed the Shoah to happen in the first place hasn’t disappeared, has not been cured, has not been addressed, and has not abated."

The Russian newspaper says it confirmed the news with government officials and an analyst of the region also confirmed the news to the Times with her own sources. Three men are known to have been murdered, although the real number is likely to be higher.  in almost every genocide, the first “act” is the rounding up and killing of a group of men, specifically.  In “root and branch” genocides they [”civilian men of ‘battle age’”] are often the first group to be separated out and massacred, paving the way for the murder of women, children, and elderly men. In more common articulations of genocide, however, they can be the only group slated for outright massacre, while women, children, and elderly men suffer a range of alternative fates involving rape, sexual exploitation, torture, forced maternity, murder, and expulsion. Gender and the Future of Genocide Studies and Prevention   as the rest of this article explains this isn’t to say that men have it worst in a genocide, but that it’s important when you see a very common red flag for genocide to pay attention to the “conflict” in case any more markers of an impending genocide occur.  the g word is really loaded and i’m not bringing this up because i want to start an avalanche of “CHECHNYA IS COMMITTING GENOCIDE AGAINST GAY PEOPLE” fear mongering (that is the absolute last thing that i want). it’s just not possible to prevent any genocide without questioning whether a current conflict might eventually get there. and i do not think it’s nothing that genocide watch is reporting on this.  UPDATE 4/10/17 Chechnya has opened concentration camps for gay men   Gay men arrested in a ‘purge’ in the Russian region of Chechnya are being held in concentration camp-style prisons, reports have alleged. Early reports emerged earlier this month that gay people are being targeted in the region, which is part of Russia but has substantial autonomy. Russian newspapers and human rights groups report that more than 100 gay men have been detained “in connection with their non-traditional sexual orientation, or suspicion of such” as part of a purge. Several people were also reportedly feared dead following violent raids. In a chilling response, a Chechen government spokesperson denied that there are any gay people to detain, insisting that “you can’t detain and harass someone who doesn’t exist in the republic”. The Kremlin denied any knowledge of a purge. But reports have since emerged that the men arrested are being kept in horrific concentration camp prisons, where violent abuse and torture is common. Based on interviews with eyewitnesses and survivors, Novaya Gazeta reports that a secret prison has been set up in the town of Argun to detain the men arrested in the purge. One man who was released from the camp told the newspaper that he was subjected to violent “interrogations” at the camp, as Chechen officials attempted to get him to confess the names and locations of more gay men. The officials also seized his mobile phone, targeting his network of contacts regardless of whether they were gay or not. The camp was reportedly set up by Chechen forces in a former military headquarters in the town. The newspaper reports allegations that the Speaker of the Parliament of Chechnya was among officials to visit the site, though the claims have not been substantiated. The detainees face electric shock torture and violent beatings, while some of them have been held to ransom and used to extort their families. Tanya Lokshina of Human Rights Watch wrote: “For several weeks now, a brutal campaign against LGBT people has been sweeping through Chechnya. She continued: “Law enforcement and security agency officials under control of the ruthless head of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, have rounded up dozens of men on suspicion of being gay, torturing and humiliating the victims. “Some of the men have forcibly disappeared. Others were returned to their families barely alive from beatings. At least three men apparently have died since this brutal campaign began.” She added: “These days, very few people in Chechnya dare speak to human rights monitors or journalists even anonymously because the climate of fear is overwhelming and people have been largely intimidated into silence. “Filing an official complaint against local security officials is extremely dangerous, as retaliation by local authorities is practically inevitable. “It is difficult to overstate just how vulnerable LGBT people are in Chechnya, where homophobia is intense and rampant. “LGBT people are in danger not only of persecution by the authorities but also of falling victim to ‘honour killings’ by their own relatives for tarnishing family honour.” What Can We Do?   Alexander Artmyev from Amnesty International spoke to Metro.co.uk. He said that people who are not in Russia can help by joining the charity’s Urgent Action on Chechnya. The action encourages people to write in Russian or your own language to Chairman of the Investigation Committee and Acting Head of the Investigation Committee for the Chechen Republic. Amnesty has also asked the letter, which should ask for an investigation and appeal for protection for LGBT individuals, to be copied into Human Rights groups and diplomatic missions from your country.

Playful ad campaigns pushed suburban ownership. The public and private sectors worked in conjunction to develop new neighborhoods that would surround the great cities we’ve come to know. In 1934, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) was created to assist in providing Americans federally guaranteed loans and 30-year mortgage terms to begin migrating from cities to the suburbs (a movement which would later be widely referred to as white flight). The goal was simple: build the middle class (while keeping others out of it).Throughout American history, banks were known for unfair loan practices; but, nothing made it an acceptable way of business more than in the early 1930s when the Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC), accompanied by local lenders and realtors, began evaluating the mortgage loan risk of 239 cities nationwide. They looked at a series of factors to help determine where the government’s investments would stand the greatest opportunity of return with the greatest weight being tied to the general racial makeup of a neighborhood; or, in their words: “[the] threat of infiltration of foreign-born, negro, or lower grade population.” Upon receiving the city assessment and security maps, generated by the FHA, private banks would take a red marker and literally outline neighborhoods on the map that were given the lowest grades, hence redlining.City maps were examined and broken down into four categories:Grade A (green): highly desirableGrade B (blue): somewhat desirableGrade C (yellow): decliningGrade D (red): to be avoided  Areas that were more black than others or even located near black people were given lower grades of C and D. Simply put, your chances of receiving an insured mortgage loan in either of these two categories was nearly zero. By excluding African Americans and Latinos from the mortgage market, it opened up many families to predatory lending which assisted in sparking subsequent generations of despair and poverty. By the 1950s, industrial companies had packed up and moved to the surrounding suburbs where white people now abundantly lived. This meant people of color were relegated to levels of high unemployment and diminishing neighborhoods that were being disinvested in and ignored. For twenty years, between the 1930s and 50s, three-fifths of homes purchased were financed by FHA. Realize, of that number, less than 2% of FHA loans went to non-white homebuyers.

But sources from inside Wednesday’s meeting revealed some key areas where the president said he could cave.Summarizing the negotiations, New York Magazine’s Margaret Hartmann observed that “the White House isn’t completely opposed to making the AHCA even worse for poor people.”Hartmann reports: “When the conservative groups brought up rolling back Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion next year rather than holding off until 2020, Trump aides said they were ‘open to discussing it,’ according to CNN. The [Washington] Postreported that the White House also seemed open to allowing insurance companies to offer less robust health plans in 2018, rather than waiting to 2020.”As the Post explains, 31 states plus the District of Columbia have accepted Medicaid expansion under the Obama administration’s Affordable Care Act (ACA) and, in its current iteration, the AHCA would restrict Medicaid payments starting in 2020.Further, Trump’s team—which included senior advisers Steve Bannon, Reince Priebus, Kellyanne Conway and Marc Short, as well as White House Budget director Mick Mulvaney—signaled they’d be open to raising the cap on how much money people can put into tax-exempt Health Savings Accounts, which have previously been dubbed “another gimme for the rich.”At one point in the meeting, the sources alleged, Trump lambasted the activist groups for “helping the other side” in opposing the bill, ensuring them: “This is going to be great. You’re going to make it even greater.”The president, according to Politico, also “laid out his strategy for winning passage in the Senate, telling the meeting he will campaign heavily in red states featuring vulnerable Democrats up for re-election. ‘Trump said he will have football stadium events in states where he won by 10-12 points and he is going to dare people to vote against him,’ a source at the meeting said.”Because no one would DARE to vote against Putin’s Puppet!In the event that his bullying tactics won’t win the number of votes needed to pass the AHCA, Trump also let on that he’d be willing to “let Obamacare fail and let Dems take the blame,” as CNN’s White House correspondent Jim Acosta reported.The meeting was held the same day that the rushed bill was being marked up in Congressional subcommittees. At least one of the meeting’s activist attendees expressed hope that many of the conservative changes were being pushed through in deliberations out of the public eye, though reports on the committee meetings indicated that Republicans were largely leaving the legislation untouched.“I’m most optimistic that they’re actually pushing back in the House and ultimately in the Senate to improve the bill,” David McIntosh, president of the Club for Growth, told the Post. “They’re not saying that in public, but they’re negotiating.”This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License  " False link

This is so validating. Finally, someone who isn’t Jewish is calling out antisemitism on the left. Finally.“ Supporting the self-determination of many oppressed minorities such as  the Kurdish people, it would be hypocritical and flat-out wrong for me  to say I did not support the self-determination of the Jewish people.  Being historically discriminated against, oppressed, and subject to  genocide, Jewish people have every right to want self-determination, and  denying this is anti-Semitic. Now, I have seen the left liken this to  the settler colonialism of Indigenous peoples in Canada. While I am  opposed to plenty of actions taken by the state of Israel, most notably  the vast displacement of Palestinians and the expansion of settlements  that continue to marginalize and displace Palestinians, I am  uncomfortable with the comparison. This is because white people  colonizing has a far different and more oppressive history. White  supremacy exists. “Jewish supremacy” does not, and such myths have only  perpetuated hateful sentiments against the Jewish people. Further I’d  like to pre-emptively add that I would not classify Jews as white  because historically Jewish people as a class have been otherized by  white supremacy, not included in any of it or its benefits. Yes, some  Jews are white passing, just as some Arabs (including myself!) are.  “THANK YOU!“ Because of this difficult and nuanced situation, the concerns of Jewish  people are often not addressed on the left. When any other group says “I  am a (marginalized group) and this is (racist/sexist/homophobic etc.)”,  leftist strategy is always to believe them. It’s not to question the  lived experience of members of marginalized groups or to say “no, this  is not racist”. Thus, when Jewish people feel alienated by certain  tenets of anti-Israel politics, we need to listen to them, not simply  say “no, this isn’t racist, there’s a difference between supporting  Israel and supporting Jewish people”. Yes, of course there’s a  difference. I support Arabs while thinking that plenty of the  institutional practices of Arab states are extremely problematic. But we  need to be held accountable and realize that systemic anti-Semitism can  make us think we’re not being racist or discriminatory towards Jewish  people when we really are.  “THIS IS ACTUALLY AMAZINGLY GOODBARUCH HASHEM" False link
