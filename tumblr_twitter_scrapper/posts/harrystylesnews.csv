Nice to be with you.1LIVE: Congratulations on the success of “ Sign Of The Times ”. The single was number one in 86 countries. Have you felt pressured in the selection of your first single, because your (former) colleagues Zayn Malik, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson have already released quite successful solo stuff before you?Harry Styles: Yes, you can feel a certain pressure when you release something personal. You feel somehow vulnerable. But I’m happy with the result and it could not have been better.1LIVE: In the UK, you even kicked Ed Sheeran from # 1 on the charts. Did he complain to you?Harry Styles: No, he wrote me a mega-friendly email. Great guy! So, to have songs in the charts competing against him - that is really an honor.1LIVE: Were there any friendly emails among the One Direction guys?Harry Styles: Yeah, the guys wrote to me that they heard the song and found it really good. We are regularly in touch. And it’s great to see how successful we are solo and how much fun it is.1LIVE: So no “ One Direction” -Reunion 2018?Harry Styles: I don’t think any of us are against working together again in the future but at the moment we just enjoy doing our own projects.1LIVE: With your solo album “ Harry Styles ” you want to show the world your true self - thoughtful, emotional, vulnerable - do you think that a song on the album will surprise the fans especially?Harry Styles: Yes, “ Woman ” will probably surprise my fans the most, even from the sound, the drums and stuff. We experimented a quite a lot in the studio and  ""Woman"" came out - one of our favorite songs on the album.1LIVE: From 19 September to 8 December, you will be on the world tour with the album in the USA, Europe, Singapore, Australia and Japan. What is the worst thing on tour?Harry Styles: If you miss the alarm clock! That is the worst! The door opens and you only hear: You have two more minutes!1LIVE: Before you enter the sector on October 27, we’ll see you from the end of June in the cinema: You play in the war film “ Dunkirk ” with Tom Hardy . Did you actually know that actor Channing Tatum and some other celebrities recently gave you stripper nicknames? Just in case you ever want to apply for a guest role in a “ Magic Mike ” session.Harry Styles: What? I did not know that. What is my stripper name?1LIVE: The English Muffin .Harry Styles: Ahhh, The English Muffin. I think we all know what he was referring to: Thanks, Channing Tatum!" False text

Or create a new account and then connect it to register.Q: Where does the #VerifiedFan program apply?A: Harry Styles Live On Tour is using #VerifiedFan for the U.S. + Canada only.

Veteran music manager Irving Azoff, his son Jeffrey Azoff and Brandon Creed of The Creed Company have merged their firms, Billboard has confirmed. All artists represented by the senior Azoff (including The Eagles, Lindsey Buckingham, Steely Dan, Gwen Stefani, Bon Jovi, John Mayer and Chelsea Handler) along with Jefrrey Azoff clients Harry Styles and Meghan Trainor and Creed’s roster (Mark Ronson, Troye Sivan, Sara Bareilles) are being handled out of Full Stop Management’s west Los Angeles office. In addition to acts represented, according to insiders, respective employees and existing partnerships at each of the firms will also be joining the new entity in the coming days and weeks. The merging “of veteran and emerging artists,” a source tells Billboard, signals a true “joining of forces” for the managers. Azoff launched Full Stop in March 2016, leaving CAA after a three-and-a-half-year run. Creed’s company represented Bruno Mars for nine years and has most recently added to its client list buzzed-about newcomers Daya and Skip Marley. Creed’s brother, attorney Jesse Creed, is currently running for Los Angeles City Council. Irving Azoff serves as chairman and CEO of Azoff MSG Entertainment and had previously held chief executive roles at Ticketmaster and Live Nation.

But I just now stumbled across the fact that Steve has a foundation that supports brain science and research.  So if you’d like to say and additional “thank you” to Steve Aoki for being a stand-up guy and great friend to Louis - and us - a donation to the Aoki Foundation I think would be a wonderful gesture :) The AOKI FOUNDATION has a primary goal of supporting organizations in the brain science and research areas with a specific focus on regenerative medicine and brain preservation. Our vision is to one day see a world where degenerative brain diseases do not exist and science and technology play a direct role in extending the healthy lives of ourselves and our loved ones. The Foundation also supports humanitarian causes dear and near to Steve Aoki such as disaster relief, developmental disabilities, and animal-rights.
