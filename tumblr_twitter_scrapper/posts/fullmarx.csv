It’s not an appropriate tool for many situations, and can only really be wielded effectively for a handful of specific purposes. It can’t be used to construct or engrave, but it can be wedged into gaps and it can break and dislodge. Similarly, we have to view voting in elections within staggeringly unequal capitalist societies in the same way - a means to an end, a tool for achieving specific results, rather than a cure-all for society’s ills. Voting once every few years for a representative selected by unaccountable party bureaucrats according to the interests of wealthy donors cannot be a method of ensuring the amplified permanence of working-class interests, but it can be used to express a rebuke, to tip fine balances in those areas where corrupt voting systems equalise themselves, and to open up political spaces for other forms of political organisation. Abstaining from voting on principle is as foolish as credulous faith in neoliberalised ‘democratic’ institutions. Nobody outside of the smoky gentlemen’s clubs frequented by Tory backbenchers even wanted this election, that much is obvious. But there’s a real opportunity for young, angry working-class people to wield the crowbar: to use their vote in pursuit of a new kind of politics. It’s not that Jeremy Corbyn would make a great PM - he’s a deeply flawed leader, despite his obvious personal sincerity. It’s not that Labour’s manifesto is a radical socialist document which will be cast in iron for the ages - it sits well to the Right of any of their official positions in the 1970s. It’s not even that Labour will be able to fulfil its promises - Labour’s Blairite backbenchers, some of whom even dub themselves ‘the Resistance’, will enact every obstacle possible to obstruct even Corbyn’s modest social-democratic reforms. It’s that a Corbyn victory would demonstrate the huge popularity of socialist ideas. It would usher in a government much more susceptible to pressure from organisations of the working-class, creating a space within which we can organise communities to push for real concrete improvements in people’s lives. And it would draw a clear line in the sand between those who are in favour of pro-working-class politics, and those who’ll devote their energies to propping up the interests of the elite - both inside and outside the Labour Party.

Like I can kinda understand with the UK given the Tory party’s historical association with landowners, but that won’t be the case everywhere while rural far right voting tends to be a common trend. Marx put it succinctly: “The idiocy of rural life”. Although that’s somewhat of a sharp phrase to our modern ears (and Marx was arguably quick to dismiss the struggles of rural workers as against those of the urbanised proletariat), he had a kernel of a point. Agricultural working-class communities are often highly fragmented in terms of their class makeup, with distinctions between landowners and tenants blurred by feudalistic bonds of patronage and familial ties, and even modern agricultural communities are often diverse in their political formations, with some families and groups maintaining political hegemony over organs like parish councils and communities boards.As well, it’s important to realise that rural communities are often highly monocultural. Taken alongside the well-documented tendency for anti-migrant sentiments and racism to proliferate in areas where there is little immigration or mixing of ethnicities, and the failure of workers organisations to effectively overcome obstacles to rural organising, it’s possible to see how rural working-class communities have become somewhat of a natural constituency for far-right groups.That said, where pro-working-class organisations have effectively combated the challenges to organising rural workers, or where pre-existing democratic traditions have been harnessed to generate new forms of solidarity, particularly in the Global South, they have often become heartlands of revolutionary movements, cf. Cuba, the FARC in Colombia, the Indian Naxalites, Native American advocacy groups in the USA, etc etc.Source: I grew up in Tory-voting Buttfuck, Nowhere." False text

[from Redditor beernsleep] FM: No society can function without a degree of coercion - only some of which is violent. Socialism seeks to minimise the degree of coercion (and violence) by democratising human organisations which produce value (ie. the ‘means of production’), and by devolving legislative power to the widest possible base in society (ie. the full participation in citizens in the creation of laws which shape their lives).  This means that the state is still a class structure - in that it represents the collective interests of a particular class - but that its nature as a coercive guardian of the interests of capital and profit has been replaced by its role as a co-ordinator for democratically agreed economic plans, and as a facilitator for the widest degree of democratic involvement. At the same time, I would expect the formal means of disciplining the working-class, ie. the police, the court system and the prisons, to be disbanded wholesale: to be replaced with locally accountable public safety committees, deliberative justice panels and socially-orientated rehabilitation programmes. As such, socialism will seek that future socialist states will have the closest possible relationship with the class whose interests they promote: no longer will a separate caste of unelected bureaucrats have insular, antagonistic relationship with ‘the economy’; rather, I think we’d see workers and trade unionists be elected to oversight boards at all levels and the regular rotation of staff (have a read about Che Guevara’s time as Cuba’s minister for economics to see how he ran his staff, eg. a system of ‘demotions’ where state workers switched places with those several levels below them, non-material rewards for high performance etc). This does not mean that socialism is entirely non-coercive. Majority decision making (and even consensus decision making) is inherently coercive to some degree, since there will always be people in that minority, and who have to abide by decisions which they object to. And if those people are damaging and disruptive, I’m sure that there will be time where the coercive elements of society will sadly have to be used - democratised and fully accountable as they may be. But socialism seeks to consciously undermine the necessity even for democratic planning or statehood by opening the possibility to lay the foundations of a communistic utopia. Contrast this with the joyful and deliberate concentration of social power in the hands of a tiny elite which inevitably follows any free-market system, and you’ll see my point.

Like would a worker coop meeting with the community to decide production be considered socialism by Marxist? Or would it have to be a planned economy? [via Redditor dovah_kun] FM: Workers controlling the means of production pretty much is the definition of socialism as far as Marxists are concerned - but when we unpack that phrase it leads to a whole set of further political conclusions.Who are the workers in question? Do we mean just white, male, blue collar workers in industrial professions? I’d argue that representing the whole of the working-class entails the deliberate and conscious enfranchisement of women, LGBT people, PoC, people with disabilities and other ‘minorities’ (who in fact make up the vast majority of the working-class) with a revolutionary politics.What does control entail? Does it just mean nominal ownership within a centrally planned state bureaucracy? Again, I’d argue that democratic participation in the process of production at all levels is vitally and inescapably important - and I think that necessarily leads one to conclude that a significant degree of participative economic planning would be both inevitable and highly desirable for fulfilling human needs. But I don’t see any contradiction between direct community control of workplaces and higher-tier democratic forums for wider social planning - within a decentralised democratic polity (rather than states with rigorously defined and policed borders) it’s absolutely possible that we could have both a high degree of communitarian control of small and medium workplaces, with more comprehensive structures of planning for more complex large industrial combines in areas like transport, finance, energy and food.And, to get super meta, what do we define as the means of production? Would we just want those large industries to be democratised, with smaller enterprises left to be run by capitalistic methods? I’d argue that that would be a contradictory halfway house which would inevitably lead to the worst kinds of social strife and counterrevolution if it were adopted as anything but the most immediate transitional measure. The core function of capital is to concentrate wealth in the hands of the few, and should be frankly stamped out as a means of allocating resources, to be replaced by communitarian self management and democratic planning in all areas of economic life. As well, I think we’d also see the democratisation of hitherto private spaces: art, journalism, culture, literature, education, public safety, etc etc.So - here we can see that a simple maxim about 'workers controlling the means of production’ does in fact contain within it a comprehensive toolkit for a new kind of society. I hope that’s some food for thought.Ask | Podcast | Support" True text

A key definition of fascism which is often left out from liberal categories is the presence of a highly organised (if not paramilitarised) mass movement made up of an unholy alliance between the petit-bourgeois and the poorest elements of the working-class. This mass movement serves to allow fascist parties within bourgeois state institutions to wield a much greater degree of independence from the ruling class than they would otherwise be capable of, what Marxists call ‘Bonapartism’. Whilst this was absolutely present in fascist Germany and Italy (and to a lesser degree in Spain), Trump has no such organised support base - and is therefore much more a prisoner to the vested interests in the financial and industrial elite who seek to use him as a pawn.  Whilst Trump’s ideas are undoubtedly fascistic, and the vocalisation of this ideology within state institutions legitimises and emboldens neo-Nazis and white nationalists, hugely increasing the dangers which they pose to PoC, women and the organised labour movement, I think it’s a misreading of the class character of Trumpism to define it as explicitly fascist. This presents us with a very different set of immediate organisational priorities: organising oppositional groups to fight for working-class political interests across and between the divisions which Trumpism seeks to widen and concretise, rather than uncompromising people’s war - at this stage."
