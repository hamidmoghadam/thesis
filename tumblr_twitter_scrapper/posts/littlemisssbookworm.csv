The first was Tuesdays with Morrie, which I read last year.The story tells of a man who attempted suicide but failed. He then gets to spend a day with his mother, who has been dead for years. Maybe now you’re thinking, how could that even be possible?! That’s what he thought too at first. But hey if you were given an extra day with your dead mother, who’s complaining? They spent the day together going to his mother’s appointments. They even ate meals in between. Why, his mother cooked, of course. As time passes, he discovers things that made him realize how he took her for granted while she was still living.Honestly, the very first thing I did when I finished this book was hug my mother and tell her how much I loved her. I recommend this book to everyone. One warning though: Tears. I’m not sure about this because I cry easily over almost anything. But of course, you need not to read this book for me to tell you this: Everyday should be an opportunity for you to show the people you love that you care for them. Spend more time with you grandparents and cousins. Help your little brother with his homework. Tell your mother you love her. Hug your father. We can’t even begin to imagine all the things they did for us to be where we are now. Do not wait until it’s too late. Not everyone is given an extra day with their loved ones.Rating: 5/5" True text

Violet is the oldest of the three. She loves inventing stuff and is interested in mechanical devices. Then there is Klaus, who loves books and reading. The youngest of them is Sunny, who’s still a baby and like most of her age, speaks unintelligible words and likes to bite hard things. The siblings lost their parents in a terrible fire and bad things happened to them one after another ever since mostly because of a man called Count Olaf. Mr. Poe, one of this parents’ associates in the bank takes care of the children’s affairs which includes finding a suitable guardian for the children but it doesn’t look like he’s good at this job.Finally Mr. Poe found the children a decent guardian! Dr. Montgomery Montgomery – he prefers Uncle Monty and don’t let him hear you teasing him about his name, he’s very sensitive about it – is a scientist who specializes in reptiles and the Baudelaires seem to enjoy being with him. Uncle Monty keeps his reptile collection in a room called the Reptile Room, hence the title of the book. All sorts of reptile can be find in the room, including the Incredibly Dead Viper which, contrary to its name, is a very friendly and harmless snake.All was well until Count Olaf came into their lives again. This man is so evil he will do everything to get the Baudelaire fortune. He’s even capable of killing someone! He disguised himself as Uncle Monty’s new assistant Stephano. The children recognized him right away but was not able to tell their Uncles because he always gets in their way.All three children thought of walking down the hall to Uncle Monty’s room and waking him up to tell him what was wrong. But to get to his bedroom, they would have to walk past the room in which Stephano was staying, and all night long Stephano kept watch in a chair place in front of his front door. When the orphans opened their doors to peer down the dark hallway, they saw Stephano’s pale, shaved head, which seemed to be floating above his body in the darkness. And they could see his knife, which Stephano was moving slowly like the pendulum of a grandfather clock. Back and forth it went, back and forth, glinting in the dim light, and the sight was so fearsome they didn’t dare try walking down the hallway.Isn’t he creepy? Something in that paragraph reminded me of an evil vampire haha. Well, Uncle Monty knew something was wrong with his new assistant. But before they can do something about this, Count Olaf had already executed his plan. Poor Uncle Monty. :( Fortunately, Mr. Poe arrived before Olaf was able to take the children away. The things is Mr. Poe is almost of no use at all. He wouldn’t believe the children that Stephano is actually Count Olaf in disguise. He says that the children are just in shock and trauma because of their previous encounter with Olaf blah blah blah. The children were almost taken away by Count Olaf, but thanks to Violet who came up with the evidence, Mr. Poe saw through Olaf’s disguise and realized what he had done.Count Olaf may have failed this time but the book’s ending is very far from happy. Olaf was able to run away before the authorities can catch him and the Baudelaires are once again homeless and orphans. If not for Count Olaf, I think the children would have been happy with Uncle Monty. But then again, this wouldn’t happen to them at all had their parents not died in the fire.I recommend this for people who loves to feel schadenfreude, which here means, “a German word for the pleasure felt seeing the Baudelaires experience such troubles and misfortunes at a very young age.” Rating: 4/5" True text

During this year of transition from being a college student to a working *coughs* adult, I think there is no better time for me to read this book. A few reminders for myself after reading this:Do not spend too much time on trivial things, find out which ones really matter and do not take them for granted.The world is a such a big place but finding these things should not be too hard, you just have to look at the right places.People come and go, but they don’t necessarily take with them all the memories you shared together.It’s okay to grow up. Just don’t be one of those very strange, very odd, very very odd, and altogether extraordinary grown-ups that the little prince met.

That left them homeless and orphans – their parents had been in their house during the fire. On the brighter (only a bit) side, their parents left them fortune which will be available to them once Violet comes of age. For the mean time, they will be sent under the care of their closest relative. The closest relative, it turned out, is a man named Count Olaf. Count Olaf is as evil as his name sounds, or maybe more. He did horrible, disgusting, horrible, horrible, evil, (and did I say horrible?) things just to get his hands on the Baudelaire fortune. I won’t go into the details of the horrible (really) things he’d done, you’d have to read them for yourself. Of course he failed, at least for now. This is indeed a very bad beginning, and surely there are more, for the lack of better phrase, unfortunate events coming in the life Baudelaires’ lives.Five things about this book:This book looks it’s written mainly for children because of how Snicket throws in some rather advanced words or phrases then describes their meaning based on the context of the story. In my age, I still learned some new words hahaha. But I’m not really sure about the constant wave of the Baudelaire’s bad luck that may not be good for very young audiences. To be fair, he gave more than enough reminders that this book does not really have a happy ending (or beginning, or middle part).This Count Olaf man is really evil and I hate him and his plans. The people in his troupe looks no less evil than him, too. The Baudelaires’ new guardian can’t even provide their basic needs, like proper place to sleep, maybe? And he has the nerve the make the children do house chores and cook for him and his friends? I mean really, didn’t Mr. Poe even check this person’s background before entrusting the children to him? Speaking of Mr. Poe,I hated Mr. Poe the moment he disregarded the children when they came asking him for help. I mean, the children came all the way from the current home (if you can call it one) to the bank just to tell him of how horrible Count Olaf is as a guardian and he just brushed them off. He even told Count Olaf had they had gone to see him. He’s obviously not doing a very good job overseeing the children’s concerns.There’s also the Judge neighbor who, without knowing took part in Count Olaf’s evil plans. I mean, it’s quite obvious that Count Olaf is up to something evil and the adults so oblivious to it. It looks like the children in this story are much more sensible that the adults.[Number 5 below]If this book wants the reader to realize that life is generally miserable for some people and the world is full of evil, it certainly didn’t fail. Anyway, I’m going to continue to read this series just to see what happens to the Baudelaires next. I hope something grand and good happen to the Baudelaires in the end but the titles of the succeeding books don’t look so promising.Rating: 4/5Keep reading for number 5, may contain spoiler though.5. A major WTF moment for me from this book: I know that in some places, if someone who is not of legal age yet wants to marry someone, they need the consent of the parents or legal guardian. But where in the world is it legal for you to marry your own guardian, even if they gave you the consent???" True text
