NOT RED. THAT MEANS NO RED YOU BITCH That scene gets me so fucking heated  forcing myself to get through these Feylin smut scenes   “There is no such thing as a High Lady.” Just you wait, Tamlin, just you wait.   “You will forgive him if his family’s own slaughter keeps him from being so… liberal with your safety. He’s lost those he cares for too many times. We all have.” YEAH, DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO ELSE HAS LOST THEIR FAMILY???? RHYSAND. RHYSAND DOESN’T KEEP FEYRE LOCKED AWAY, AND HE’S LOST EVERYTHING PRETTY MUCH, SO DON’T GIVE ME THAT BULLSHIT EXCUSE LUCIEN  “He’s probably running scared now that Tamlin’s got his powers back.” “Then you don’t know Rhysand very well at all.” Hart, Feyre doesn’t have time for your bullshit  “And red ones. Like drops of blood amongst the white, red petals had been sprayed across the path ahead.” fuckyouianthe “Hello, Feyre darling,” he purred.’  Here it comes, the iconic shoe throwing scene  “Interesting,” he murmured, and continued on his way.’ WHAT DOES THIS MEAN  “Maybe I’d wait until the mating bond snapped into place, until I knew for sure it couldn’t be some mistake, that… that I was worthy of him.” TAMLIN👏ISN'T👏WORTHY👏OF👏YOU   I wonder who has the pleasure of finding that lovely wedding dress Feyre left in the Night Court  “Don’t invade,” I breathed. I’d get on my knees for this. I’d crawl if I had to. “Don’t invade - please.” Rhys cocked his head, his mouth tightening. “You truly think I’m a monster, even after everything.” BREAKS MY HEART EVERY BLOODY TIME  “One, you’re… close to Tamlin. He has men - but he also has long-existing ties to Hybern-” “He’d never help the king-”    “I saw you trap the Middengard Wyrm like a rabbit.” His eyes twinkled.’ RHYS’ EYES ARE TWINKLING BECAUSE THAT WAS WHEN HE FELL IN LOVE WITH FEYRE  “We’re not finished with this meal,” Tamlin growled. “Oh, get over yourself,” I barked, and left.’ YES, FEYRE, YOU TELL HIM Tamlin does all this stuff out of anger, scares the shit out of everyone, would’ve probably killed Feyre when he exploded in the study if it weren’t for her wind bubble. And he asks her to “forget about it” and “move past it”   “Feyre.” Rhys’s eyes lingered, taking in every detail. “Are you running low on food here?” This gets me every time I read this book, Feyre is starved, there’s nothing of her, she’s slowly fading away and no one but Rhysand notices  “Rhys frowned at me. And I debated barking something nasty at him, but it would have required more fire than I had - and would have required caring what he thought.” Honestly this book breaks my heart over and over again  “He stepped around Tamlin as if he were a piece of furniture” Part two of Rhysand treating people like furniture to get to Feyre   “Tell me what to do,” he said. “Tell me what to do to help you.” literally already sobbing   Tamlin locked her way, and he didn’t even turn around, he didn’t even sound or look apologetic. He locked Feyre away, and he didn’t give a shit. My blood is boiling. Like I want to hit something please Alis is supposedly Loyal to Tamlin, but when she sees Feyre is slowly dying, SHE HELPS UNLIKE THE REST OF THE SPRING FUCKING COURT " False text
