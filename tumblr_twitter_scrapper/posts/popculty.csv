Yes, this was the biggest lie of them all but Kara has been dealing with a number of incidents when her trust has been abused. Mon-El, while attempting to grow throughout this season, is still basically a 15-year-old boy. He doesn’t have the emotional wisdom to know what he’s doing. His pelvis is like a dowsing rod and his brain is just trying to catch up. For the Mon-El fans, I’m not trying to say he’s only been using Kara for (alleged) S-E-X but his actions do follow that kind of newness to feeling that a lustful boy might have as his heart tries to outgrow his immaturity. He doesn’t know what he’s doing. I wouldn’t say that’s acceptable for a boy but it’s conventional. For a man to still be exposing women to these kinds of growing pains is a kind of abuse with which Kara should not put up.”  IT GETS BETTER “The fount from which Kara draws most of her desire for Mon-El is that of another ever-present Kryptonian trait: loneliness. Kara had basically rejected Mon-El for most of the season thus far until she found herself alone again: Winn (Jeremy Jordan) and James (Mehcad Brooks) were vigilante-ing around National City, Alex (Chyler Leigh) has been shifting her Danvers Sisters conversations to Maggie (Floriana Lima), and J'onn (David Harewood) is his own aloof and distant pit of despair. Mon-El honestly liked her and wanted to puppy-dog around her, just nip at her ankles until she finally picked him up. And so she did.”  yo just fyi i made a thread with all this on twitter and tagged the writers, producers and network right here so RT if to draw their attention to this or just spread it  " False text

This is something I remind people of every years, so forgive me if you have heard me say this stuff before. But this past few months have been a bit hard on even some of the BEST comic book retailers, so please take a moment and check this message out, okay?  Let’s help them make 2017 an amazing year so they can keep bringing us wonderful nerd junk all year long.  AHEM! Free Comic Book Day on Saturday! I know I say this every year, but a lot of people believe that the comics the comic shops give away are given free to retailers.They are not. Retailers have to pay for the books. They pay a reduced fee, but they still pay for them. They also have to pay shipping. They have to pay for ads and they have to usually pay for extra employees, and many shops pay to have guests or other special events. It can end up being a huge expense, and even though a lot of new readers might come by, part of it is also a celebration of comics, and a lovely little bonus for the shop’s loyal customers. It’s a great deal of effort, as well, in most cases, with many retailers working TONS of extra hours just to make the day great for you. What I would ask everyone to do is, when you go to get your free comics, please take a little bit of extra time, even if it’s crowded, to shop in the store. Try a couple new comics off the rack or a new trade collection you have been thinking about. Maybe if you buy Magic cards or game supplies somewhere else, usually, think about buying some at the hosting store while you are there. It will add up and make their Free Comic Book Day much more successful and everyone will be happy, and it’s a nice way to say thank you.  It helps if you buy ON THE DAY of Free Comic Book Day, so that they know it makes a difference and they continue to participate.  Just a thought, but when picking up your free comics, please send a little bit of shopping love to the store that is putting on the event for you. Do it ON Free Comic Book Day so that they know the day is a success and that all their expense and effort is appreciated.Your comic store will love you and I will love you! " False text

Is that crack I’m looking at? Heroin? A burning blunt?   No, it’s sugar. I am forced to think about the ways that I have come to  expect that an all–Black show will almost certainly involve the illicit  drug trade, my eyes trained and made jaded by popular culture. (As it  turns out the show does address the presence of drugs and prisons in  Black lives, but in a way that neither demonizes nor glamorizes them.)  And this realization leads me to think about sugar, too, as a trade  equally, if not more destructive—its historical links to slavery,  colonialism, and empire, its stealthy appearance in almost every  processed food, its link to epidemics in diabetes and heart disease,  rising in particular for people of color.

The result is a renewed reflection of the power of language. In October, for example, it was not unprecedented to hear news anchors and pundits drop the word “pussy” in reference to Trump’s leaked audio recording about his penchant for grabbing privates without permission. Republican strategist Ana Navarro uttered the word on CNN and was immediately admonished by political commentator Scottie Nell Hughes: “Will you please stop saying that word? My daughter is listening.” But Navarro rightfully balked. If a presidential candidate, especially one who then went on to claim the presidency, could gleefully talk about assaulting women on tape and brandish the word “pussy” without repercussion, then why should he be the only one allowed to wield language as a weapon? Language is often used as a means to oppress, to define marginalized groups on the speaker’s own terms. This is why the creation of one’s own dialect can be used as a reclamation of power. The Good Fight has created its own oppositional dialect, and we would all do well to start chewing the fat." False link
