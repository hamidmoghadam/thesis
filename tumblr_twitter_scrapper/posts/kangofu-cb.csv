Listen to Native voices about Native issues PLEASE  MY TIME HAS COME Her name was Thocmetony.  They called her Sarah. I live in the same place where Sarah (Thocmetony) Winnemucca lived and breathed and I grew up in schools that never said her name. My teachers discussed Nevada’s early history by the means of how many pounds of silver the mines produced, and the “unfortunate but civilized” cannibals that died in our mountains (the Donner Party). A woman who should have been The Most Famous Native American Woman by the end of the American-Imperialist era, Sarah Winnemucca has been all but erased from the US historical narrative. Half of the landmarks in northern Nevada are named after her, her grandfather Truckee, and her father Chief Winnemucca*, but the majority of our schools don’t bother to mention them. (*Paiutes don’t have chiefs; their white neighbors insisted.) Sarah did so, so much. Often for so little - she won so many battles that were later ignored, overturned, or “officially” recognized but not locally. The freshly post-civil-war US government sought to economize the Native struggle, and Sarah fought back with the only thing she was allowed to fight with - words. Like any Paiute survived the unpredictability of food and weather in the Nevada High Dessert, Sarah survived every battle she lost. She was a tree that sprouted two new branches to every limb cut off; she was a princess by White Title but also by the spirit of a willpower so great, the only definition that could be remotely applicable for it would have to be “R O Y A L”. She had no weapons but a voice, which was “very pretty to hear” according to many who heard her. (And she was heard by very many.) Sarah is most known for her lectures. She traveled up and down the west and east coast, in an era that didn’t always include rail travel - in an era that didn’t always include horse travel. Years before any Native Americans began to gain any stage-fame, Sarah was preforming in little rooms crowded with 1860′s Western-Victorian women as (The Princess Sarah). In reality, the performance was a girl dressed in Fake Indian Clothes White People Expect lecturing them on the Paiute people. She would tell stories that charmed her audience but quickly focused lectures on the struggles of Native People, and Paiutes especially. Sarah lived during a time when it was appropriate for the local newspaper to suggest that they deal with the “Indian problem” via extermination. But she did so much more than lecture. Sarah understood that her attention was needed more-or-less everywhere - the wives of the Men in Charge, the Armies of the Men in Charge, and the President of The Men In Charge. She traveled back and forth between Native war parties during the Bannock War, working directly with U.S. Army Generals, endlessly negotiating for peace. She brokered for food whenever the government and/or locals decided to cut off their food supply (which was astoundingly often). In addition to learning English, she could to read and write (a time when illiteracy was common), and then learned Spanish after that. Just. You know. To talk suffrage with the Mexicans. Nbd. She went to the President of the United States as an official “royal princess” with her father Chief** Winnemucca. She often helped beg for more land to grow more food, or to at least have the government supply it- the dessert is not an easily survivable place. Paiutes were forced to stay on reservations, and in the dessert, there just aren’t enough birds for bellies. (**Add “king” to the list of things that are Not Paiute, right up there with Chief.) BUT WAIT, THERE’S MORE Ya’ll know what an Indian School is? Cultural eugenics. It was a program that kidnapped Native American children, stripped them of their given names, and taught them to act More White. Kids were shamed for doing anything that might be deemed “savage.” Sarah fought to have Paiute children taught by Paiute teachers. She did it, too, until all “Indian children” were required by law to attend boarding schools. Regardless of this loss, in my experience modern Paiutes are hugely into supporting the education of their children and preserving their culture. NOT ONLY was she super politically involved as an activist, but Sarah was also pretty damn bold with her personal life. She married several times, and to white men. Biracial couples were illegal at several points in her life. Homegirl had SEVERAL, bless her heart. Tl;dr Sarah Winnemucca should be a common household name, more common than Sacajawea or Pocahontas. She worked tirelessly for peace. Don’t erase her from our narrative.  Educate yourselves: Life Among the Paiutes: Their Wrongs and Claims - autobiography by Sarah Winnemucca Sarah Winnemucca, biography by Sally Zanjani Or this really thin article on American National Biography Online. (The bottom of this article has a lot more sources that I -can confirm- are pretty solid. Wikipedia, however, is not “pretty solid” when cross-referenced with primary documents. I do not recommend.) " False text

BLESSINGS BE UPON THIS POST AND ALL OF ITS BEAUTIFUL WORDS. This concept of violently-enforced rigid hierarchy within werewolf (and plain old wolf) packs is not only overdone and uninteresting, it’s just plain incorrect. A lot of where this idea comes from is really just profoundly bad science from back in the day, when scientists were studying wolf packs and making sweeping generalizations about what they were seeing. They were in fact studying CAPTIVE wolf packs made up of unrelated adult individuals who had been forced into proximity and confinement… so what they were observating as “natural wolf dominance behavior,” was in fact trapped territorial predators reacting aggressively to the stress of forced socialization and imprisonment. It’s a lot like thinking you’re going to study human social family behavior by going to your local prison and observing the interactions of the human beings present in the prison yard. Actual wolf packs are generally composed of a breeding pair of adult wolves and sometimes several years’ worth of offspring. There might be aunts and uncles and other non-breeding adults in there, who are usually relatives of other wolves in the pack. The concept of “alpha, beta, and omega” is a profoundly flawed one that has really been thrown out by modern wolf researchers, though you’ll still see it cropping up all the time as we try to explain wolf socialization to ourselves. (We’ve also used this model for other animals, like horses, and you’ll often hear about a “lead mare” and you probably have a concept of stallions who direct every movement of their herd and I could give you a ten-page sermon on why I think that’s all wrong, too.) A wolf pack is a family, not a military structure, and families have all sorts of nuance in their dynamics, not to mention a diversity that goes beyond the nuclear. When writers go straight for this hyper-masculine, hyper-aggressive idea of what werewolf pack dynamics should be like, they’re imposing human behavior on the animal, not the other way around. Like, speaking of female werewolves, can we all become more familiar with and embrace the legend of Yellowstone’s 832F, a wolf who should be a hero to us all? She led her own pack. She could take down a fucking elk single-handed. (Single-pawed?) She had TWO MATES because one wasn’t fuckin’ enough so she was like “oh, you’re brothers? I like you both, let’s all shack up.” They apparently weren’t very useful (I’m sure they were super pretty though from a wolf perspective) so she handled mmost of the pup-rearing, and hunting for those pups, on her own too. And she didn’t rule her pack with an iron fist, though she undoubtedly ruled it because she was the most competent leader they had and surprise, animals recognize and reward competent leadership in ways we humans only wish our jobs could manage. I MIGHT CRY FOREVER OVER THIS FUCKING BAD-ASS OF A WOLF.

Two Recommendations: @coeykuhn is writing a lovely dark lesbian werewolf comic  And “The Accidental Werewolf” by Dakota Cassidy may not be the least problematic read, but it deals with a socialite who gets bitten by an mangy dog, and then is approached by a hunk of a guy who tells her he’s a werewolf. It comes with an alternative take on her change. It’s pretty funny, with some female dominance plays. The main character is smart, funny, and resourceful. But it’s a trashy romance novel. @drkstars-art thanks for the recs!!! I’ll check them out." False text

Let’s have more of THAT and less of the “oh rar the moon is full that means my latent asshole tendencies come out but it’s the wolf I swear!” I s2g I am not here for dudebros using their lycanthropy as YET ANOTHER REASON why they can’t just fuckin control themselves.  Wolf rants are my favourite rants.  @jolantru has a werewolf series in which the leader is a woman and a mother of two.  Also two of my friends on here @raedmagdon and @jemeryl have written stories with HELLA LESBIAN WEREWOLVES  I NEED THIS FICTION IN MY LIFE.  ALL OF IT. GIVE ME THE FEMINIST WEREWOLF LITERATURE."

Like, the Pevensies end up the royal family in large part because everyone’s like ‘it has been prophesied that you will come and rule us and everything will be great!’ and, well, in-universe I can’t really fault them on that; if I were a young teen or pre-teen in a completely foreign country, I too would probably just go along with whatever seem to make people friendly to me. But the reaction of the Narnians, in almost ubiquitously welcoming these foreigners as obviously destined to rule them even though they know nothing of the country and the culture… now that is some creepily imperialist writing.  This is the only good reblog of this post in it’s entire 3 year hellscape existence  if four foreign kids popped out of a magic box and deposed trump by the express wishes of god’s fursona, i’d crown ‘em. this winter already fuckin feels like it’s lasted 100 years.   I’M CACKLING " False text
