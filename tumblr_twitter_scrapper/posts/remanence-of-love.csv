He made my insides feel like a roller coaster with his shy compliments and dashing smiles, he gave me hope that there was something better.  He whispered sweet ‘I love you’s and kissed with a burning fire that made me melt into his big arms.  He gave me life, and brought out a side of me I didn’t think existed.  He was the best part of me, and now that he’s gone I’m left with all my terrible thoughts and my afternoon tears because he’s the one.  But he’s not mine anymore." True text

I love how I could pick out each individual curl of his lovely long hair, I love how gently he touched me and how he kissed each inch of my face hundreds of times. How he ran his fingers through my hair until I fell asleep, and how he nuzzled into my hair and neck to smell my scent which comforted him when he was troubled.  It has been almost 2 years since he sent me that text. That damn text that broke me, and that broke him. He was my happiness and I was his, we know every detail of each others’ body and mind like it’s our own. We are truly the perfect pair and are soul mates made to complete the other’s missing half.  I have the feeling of his lips on mine memorized, I constantly remember what his hands felt like in mine and running across my skin and it makes me just want to run to him and just hold him one more time, kiss his forehead one more time, feel his hands caress my face. I’d do anything to be able to have him for myself again.  But we can’t be together anymore.  And now when I look at him from afar, I see that his smile is not as big and bright as it once was, his eyes no longer sparkle for they’ve gone dull with heart ache and pain. His hair has grown to be a mess without me to tame it as has mine. My eyes no longer glisten with the look of love and my smile is no longer as pure and real. I am truly broken as is he, and we both know it.  Whenever we are in the same room I feel him looking at me and I know he feels when I look at him. We have such a connection, I can feel when he’s around even though I cannot see him, and as soon as I see him we make eye contact and our hearts are once again shattered. I can pick out his sweet smell among thousands, I can hear his voice in crowds of people, I can taste his lips when eating our favorite food, I hear his laugh when I listen to his favorite song.  We are meant to be, but we have met at the wrong time and at the wrong place. Love has torn us apart and we are both truly broken from a love meant to be but that will never happen.  Maybe we shall meet again later in life, in the right time and the right place. I would do whatever it takes to keep him here with me, but there’s nothing I can do. So we shall have to figure out how to go on after being broken, how to live after dying, and how to love when all our love is gone." True text

Oh! I was drowned in the colourful petals of the flowers. I was obsessed with the smell of them. I was happy. Happy to be with the flowers I saw. Perfection was you and happiness was you. But that day came. The day you made myself a victim of illusion. It was not you. It was me who recognized the colour of my own mind. You were there, like a box of watercolours. You did nothing but I took your colours out; one by one. I painted my picture yet gave the credit to you. But you did not believe it. The rejection was painful  The flowers faded away. The little butterfly couldn’t fly anymore. What were the flowers? Who made them? Why I loved them too much? Bitter was the reality. Mind is a painter. Sometimes a Picasso. An Anjelo sometimes.He looks at the beautiful flower, grabs the beauty of it and make it an exquisite piece of art on canvas. So did I. I looked at your beauty; the beauty of your soul, grabbed the depth of you and painted it on my mind canvas and named it LOVE. The flower stayed as it was, not knowing what the painter did to her. So did you stay, not knowing what I did to you inside my mind.  Alas! The painter glued me to a canvas of imagination and illsion. Yet it is beautiful and attractive, but when pain rouse though the beauty, I question myself about the real painter. I question about love; who made myself fall in love?  I painted it all alone. -Anuththara Ekeli-" False text
