The Nazis were quick to adopt the Soviet methods.  They imported from Russia: the one-party system and the pre-eminence of  this party in political life; the paramount position assigned to the  secret police; the concentration camps; the administrative execution or  imprisonment of all opponents; the extermination of the families of  suspects and of exiles; the methods of propaganda; the organization of  affiliated parties abroad and their employment for fighting their  domestic governments and espionage and sabotage; the use of the  diplomatic and consular service for fomenting revolution; and many other  things besides. There were nowhere more docile disciples of Lenin,  Trotsky and Stalin than the Nazis were.       Hitler was not the founder of Nazism; he was its product. He was, like  most of his collaborators, a sadistic gangster. He was uneducated and  ignorant; he had failed even in the lower grades of high school. He  never had any honest job. It is a fable that he had ever been a  paperhanger. His military career in the first World War was rather  mediocre. The First Class Iron Cross was given to him after the end of  the war as a reward for his activities as a political agent. He was a  maniac obsessed by megalomania. But learned professors nourished his  self-conceit. Werner Sombart, who once had boasted that his life was  devoted to the task of fighting for the ideas of Marx,*77  Sombart, whom the American Economic Association had elected to Honorary  membership and many non-German universities to honorary degrees,  candidly declared that Führertum means a permanent revelation and that the Führer received his orders directly from God, the supreme Führer of the Universe.*78       The Nazi plan was more comprehensive and therefore more pernicious than that of the Marxians. It aimed at abolishing laisser-faire  not only in the production of material goods, but no less in the  production of men. The Führer was not only the general manager of all  industries; he was also the general manager of the breeding-farm intent  upon rearing superior men and eliminating inferior stock. A grandiose  scheme of eugenics was to be put into effect according to “scientific”  principles…”             — Ludwig von Mises " False text

Who could be against neutrality right? It’s not neutral though:“We shouldn’t waste so much breath on the idea of keeping the network completely neutral. It isn’t neutral now. What we should really be doing is looking for ways we can increase competition among ISPs—ways we can prevent the Comcasts and the AT&Ts from gaining so much power that they can completely control the market for internet bandwidth. Sure, we don’t want ISPs blocking certain types of traffic. And we don’t want them delivering their own stuff at 10 gigabits per second and everyone else’s stuff at 1 gigabit. But competition is also the best way to stop these types of extreme behavior.  Though the network will never be neutral, we can find ways of promoting a vibrant market for fast internet speeds that’s open to everyone. At the end of his rant, John Oliver actually comes pretty close to the real issue. Advocates, he says, “should not be talking about protecting net neutrality. They shouldn’t even use that phrase. They should call it preventing cable company f***ery, because that is what it is.”             — What Everyone Gets Wrong on the Debate Over Net Neutrality Stephan Kinsella offers the better approach:Is “no regulation of network providers” the libertarian position? It  clearly would be if the network providers were purely private. In the  libertarian view private property owners determine how their property  may be used. There is no “right” to access the Internet. A private  network provider ought to be able to offer service on whatever terms he  wants; and consumers to accept or reject it. Tiered services, deep packet inspection,  prohibition of certain types of uses or even certain types of  content–that’s up to the providers and customers and whatever deal they  agree to. We libertarians believe in “capitalist acts between consenting  adults,” to use Nozick’s phrase (see Rothbard’s earlier formulation).But  because of various degrees of corporatism–state favors and  protectionism, tax funding of infrastructure, etc.–the service providers  are arguably not 100% private. But the solution is not to regard them  as essentially part of the state and thus fair game for regulation, but  to pair our call for no state regulation of the Internet (no net  neutrality regulations) with a call for the abolition of all forms of  corporatism, such as various laws that work out protecting larger  companies (tax funded subsidies, IP law, wage and hour legislation,  mandatory worker benefits, labor union legislation, minimum wage,  incorporation statutes [note: this does not mean I think that limited liability is a privilege conferred by the state on corporations], and so on)."

The greatest moral failure of capitalism is that it turned these necessities into commodities.  The greatest moral failure of capitalists is finding ways to justify withholding what we need to live while it is in abundance for the sake of profit.  Speaking of moral failure You only deserve what you earn. You do not deserve goods and services produced by other people. If you wish to acquire said goods and services you must offer compensation for that person’s labour, a profit for their hard work. If instead you wish to create a system of obligation to provide said goods and services without compensation, you establish slavery for the sake of your entitlement. Tell me again how slavery is a moral good.  I’m always amazed how capitalists hear “People shouldn’t starve” and think “This person is advocating for SLAVERY!” No friend. Taxes are not slavery. If you TRULY think that no one is entitled to the profit of labor produced by others, then you must admit that our current system of CEOs exploiting their workers with starvation ages, growing rich on the profit of other people’s labor, is morally unacceptable.   More moral failure I’ve previously written on how taxation is a form of slavery, so I won’t repeat myself here. As for whether profit gained from the exchange of labour for wages is morally bad, that would depend on whether it is voluntary. I did amend my original response a few minutes after posting as I realised I had left out an important word. Here’s what it reads on my blog:  “If instead you wish to create a system of involuntary obligation to provide said goods and services without compensation, you establish slavery for the sake of your entitlement.” People are free to create voluntary mutual obligations between themselves, such as a contract between an employer and an employee. There is nothing morally wrong with such an arrangement. However, when obligations are imposed involuntarily, they become an attempt to claim ownership over the life, liberty, and/or property of another. In other words, slavery. Sorry to burst your bubble, but positive rights are utopian and unchosen positive obligations are antithetical to a free society. " False text

Why does the public obey the State, and go further to endorse statist policies that benefit the Power Elite at the public’s own expense? The answer, wrote Spooner, is that the State is supported by three powerful groups: knaves, who know what is going on and benefit from State rule; dupes, who are fooled into thinking that State rule is in their and everyone else’s interest; and cowards, who know the truth but are afraid to proclaim that the emperor has no clothes. I think we can refine Spooner’s analysis and merge the Knave and Coward categories; after all, the renegade sellout confronts the carrot and the stick: the carrot of wealth, cushy jobs, and prestige if he goes along with the Emperor; and the stick of scorn, exclusion from wealth, prestige, and jobs - and perhaps worse - if he fails to go along……In the history of ideological movements, there have always been people willing to sell their souls and their principles. But never in history have so many sold out for so pitifully little. Hordes of libertarian and free-market intellectuals and activists rushed to Washington to whore after lousy little jobs, crummy little grants, and sporadic little conferences. It is bad enough to sell out; it is far worse to be a two-bit whore. And worst of all in this sickening spectacle were those who went into the tank without so much as a clear offer: betraying the values and principles of a lifetime in order to position themselves in hopes of being propositioned. And so they wriggled around the seats of power in Washington. The intellectual corruption spread rapidly, in proportion to the height and length of jobs in the Reagan Administration. Lifelong opponents of budget deficits remarkably began to weave sophisticated and absurd apologias, now that the great Reagan was piling them up, claiming, very much like the hated left-wing Keynesians of yore, that “deficits don’t matter.” Shorn of intellectual support, the half-formed libertarian instincts of the American masses remained content with Reaganite rhetoric, and the actual diametrically opposite policies got lost in the shuffle…          — Murray Rothbard" False text

No production is worth maintaining if it is not  suited to bring about the cheapest and best supply.

The  highest goal of all economic activity is the achievement of the best and  most abundant satisfaction of wants at the smallest cost.

Such a system may seem  discussible when the special interests of small groups are protected  against the great mass of others, since the privileged party then gains  more from his privilege as a producer than he loses on the other hand as  a consumer; it becomes absurd when it is raised to a general principle,  since then every individual loses infinitely more as a consumer than he  may be able to gain as a producer.

I try to visit a few different stadiums every summer. As disgustingly corporatist as all sports tend to be, I can’t help myself but be a fan of athletic competition. As is customary, the game would be preceded by a singing of the national anthem and - less customarily - a recital of the “Pledge of Allegiance.” The good sport that I am, I politely stood up for both - but I neither removed my hat nor placed my hand over my “heart.” I also didn’t recite or sing a syllable. Well, some older gentleman a few rows back yelled at me repeatedly to remove my hat. If this state pomposity and pageantry is so important to him, why would he take his attention away from it and focus it on me? I ignored him, figured he’d take a hint.  Alas, his skull was too dense for any hint to penetrate - once hats were returned to heads and asses returned to seats, he scuttered up to me and yelled: “How dare you not take your hat off? Don’t you have any damn respect for this country?” I stayed seated. I’m a big dude with no shortage of experience in fights (though I’ve since considerably tempered my temper from my college days); as such, I have nothing to prove and less to gain by responding in anger. I calmly replied: “What better way to respect our freedoms than to exercise them? Plus - not that it should matter - you don’t know what reasons I may have to keep my hat on. I could have just had a head injury…” Probably an unecessary point, but I was trying to highlight how ridiculously selfish it is to assert that his priorities should trump mine. He screamed something about a tumor and that there’s no excuse for my blasphemy (not a word he used, though the sentiment was clear), at which point the person I went to the game with shouted some expletive-flavored versions of my arguments and generally diffused the situation through livid escalation. The “Pledge of Allegiance” (which was written by a socialist to help sell flags and magazine subscriptions to public schools) - is creepy. I do not pledge myself to a piece of fabric. I will gladly swear allegiance to my daughters, my wife, my family, my God, people truly important to me… but to a government? No. Governments are forever changing and catering to the interests of something or someone else. To pledge myself to a government is to pledge my loyalty to the whims and corruption of others, and to the tyrannical monopolizer of force that continually finds new ways to aggress against me and my loved ones (to the tune of hundreds of thousands of laws). Dear statists: not following state customs is not an affront to society or an insult to you or any other individual, even a “hero” who may have “paid the greatest sacrifice for my freedoms.” The state and its symbols are not synonymous with society. Nor are they representative of you or any other individual in particular. When your identity is intermixed with your government and your patriotism becomes sacerdotal reverence, you become a mindless minion of the state to be manipulated into agreeing to whatever loss of liberty best suits your god government. Be a good neighbor to your fellow man, not a doting subject to the state. I, for one, will follow the words of Albert Camus:   “The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion.”    All the Colin Kaepernick discussion reminds me of this from many years ago.Now when I go to a game, the singing of the national anthem is when I go take a leak. (You can see more of my thoughts on the pledge and the genuflection of state symbols here.)"

They are in kindergarten and 3rd grade.  Yay, government school! Incidentally, they are being taught things their previous Montessori schools long since taught them. And this is one of the best charter schools in the entire LAUSD.  👍  Genuine question: how to you rationalize having your kids in a public school in one of the most socialist places on this continent?  It’s one of the most expensive places to live in the US, and takes more in taxes than nearly any other place in the states. Here’s an LADWP bill to get a gist of the expenses I’m talking about.  I simply cannot afford to both pay for “public” (aka government) schools (through taxes) and pay for private school - even if ultimately I’d pay less for private than I do in taxes to fund “public” schools. And “public” schooling demands so much funding that it crowds out private school, limiting their availability and variability (you can see some of my frustrations with regards to school-sponsored state worship here). We sent them to Montessori at first to give them a solid base. They excelled, learning in pre-K what LAUSD kids were learning in 2nd and 3rd grade (multiplication, as one example). When we needed to move (we have three daughters) we realized we couldn’t continue to pay for private schooling ($800-$1000/month per kid) AND an increased rent (to the tune of $3500/month) - so we looked for a place with the absolute best “public” (charter) school available. This is it. And it seems the best “public” is inferior to a mediocre private school. The move to public has seen a slowing down of their intellectual development, and introduced a lot of head- and heart-ache with regards to the overt lefty indoctrination they face.  Hopefully, I can have enough success - and luck - in my career to take them out of public schools eventually.  So tonight, my 3rd grade daughter hands me her homework to look over. Among the homework is this: This is what is of utmost importance on the second day of school. As expected, state worship is the primary concern. After all, it’s the first thing they do every morning. (My kindergartener’s first-ever homework assignment yesterday, after her first day of school, included coloring in an American flag.) So my daughter and I had a chat. We’ve previously had a number of discussions on the pledge. This was an extension of those talks. I’m always mindful to not badger her the way her school might, or have her participate in mindless echoing of my opinions. Unlike government schools, I stress critical thinking. No question is off limits, especially if it helps her understand something. And I certainly don’t want to risk having her adopt beliefs she doesn’t understand or agree with, which in turn make make her rebel in precisely those areas as a teenager. Naturally, I couldn’t go as deep into the flag / pledge argument as I would with anyone else. And I don’t make absolute demands of her. I’ve never said “you are not allowed to participate in the pledge.” I’ve said simply that I don’t like it, and unless she fully understands what a “pledge” is and what “allegiance” is and all that entails, I don’t think it makes sense to mindlessly recite those words. But ultimately, it’s up to her. She’s the one who has to go to school every day, be looked at unkindly by teachers and peers because she may abstain from the pledge, she’s the one who must endure the questions and the peer pressure. She cannot possibly do so when her only motivation is to please daddy or simply regurgitate his thoughts. This must come as much from her own skepticism as mine. And that’s what I (hopefully!) foster.  To that end, I took a few moments to write down some statements that were more digestible by a(n incredibly bright) 7 year old. Here’s what I offered as a direct counter to what the aforementioned assignment attempted to indoctrinate her with:  A country’s flag, like any other symbol, can represent good people and good ideas and good actions taken by that country. But it also represents, because it is a symbol, the bad people and bad ideas and bad actions taken by that country.  Some people have only experienced the good, but some people have been affected by the bad more than the good.  People and ideas can deserve respect, not necessarily inanimate objects. It is not disrespectful to anyone to not follow traditions or customs that place symbols as objects of worship. While some people may feel disrespected, that has to do with their understanding and expectations of others and not with my behavior.  My family is very important to me. So are the ideas of love and kindness and friendship. If I carry a sticker of a pink star that I say represents family, love, kindness, and friendship, I should not be upset if other people don’t take off their hats and place their hands over their hearts at the sight of my sticker. And even if they don’t do that, it doesn’t necessarily mean they don’t value family, love, kindness, and friendship.  Note, I didn’t use the word “government.” Although she’s already familiar with the construct, I didn’t want to muddy the concept further. I also didn’t want that to be her chief takeaway, since she’s already used to pointing out how so many bad guys (like in Star Wars) are government agents.  I asked her to read it a few times and we went through discussing each sentence as necessary. I expanded on the symbol idea. I asked her to think about a flag with a brown dog on it. Some people will look at it and think happy thoughts about playing with puppies or they will remember the dog they had when they were a kid or maybe some fun dog from a movie they like. But what if there was someone who was once bitten very hard by a brown dog. Wouldn’t they think thoughts that are not happy? Isn’t that not only okay, but understandable? Maybe that person doesn’t even want to look at that dog flag. Should we make that person look at it or salute it? If we love puppies and the dog flag, should we feel disrespected that that person doesn’t like the dog flag like we do? Technically, the photo of her work above is not what she initially handed me. I explained to her that those statements were opinion, and it was okay to disagree. If she understood what I had written and she understood that it was okay to disagree with her assignment’s conclusions, I asked her to include “according to the guidelines above” to a few of the answers. While this discussion was taking place in my office, my kindergartner was having a conversation with my 2 year old in the dining room. I shit you not: middle sister was teaching litter sister the Pledge of Allegiance.  Again, this is after the second day of school. Middle sister has just come from Montessori where this was not taught. So naturally, I had a light discussion with my kindergartner about the basics. Luckily, in true Montessori fashion, older sister chimed in on the topic of the pledge. Apparently, she’s been tough (far tougher than I’m sure I would have been): without calling attention to herself, she stands quietly with her hands to her sides as everyone around her drones words they do not comprehend. And so big sister offered middle sister tips on doing just that. Oh, and yesterday, after her first day in school, my eldest says: I want Hillary to win because it will be nice to finally have a girl president.”  This was as we were all cleaning up our plates after dinner, and I’m pretty sure it caused my wife to drop her silverware (more out of laughter than disgust, to be fair). Still, this is a thought that was wholly birthed in her government classroom after her first day in school! Clearly, this is a thought her teacher shared with the class - a class of rapt 7 and 8 year olds. She asked me who I was voting for. I explained I wasn’t going to vote. She asked, “but don’t you want to see what it’s like to have a girl president?” I simply responded: “Does it matter very much if the bully who steals your lunch is a boy or a girl?” “No,” was her answer, of course. I continued: “Whoever is president is going to tell us how to live our lives, take money from our family, and hurt people. They will do it with or without my help, but if I help them, doesn’t that mean I’ve given them permission to do all those things to us?” It’s only been two days! Raising independent, non-state-worshipping kids in LA ain’t easy.  This is day 7 of 3rd grade: Her last answer makes me swell with pride.   Day 8:  Just got an automated call from the school.Tomorrow, day 10, is a “Patriotic Assembly.” Kids of all grades (which includes my kindergartner and 3rd grader) are asked to “wear red, white, and blue” and parents are invited to gather in the courtyard in front of the school with the kids at 8:20a to “honor the flag.”It’s seriously non-stop."

This action can consist of a temporary boycott – no Pepsi today – or it could even be permanent.Another popular option is to reform the company from within, for example, by buying green stocks to force a polluting company to make more sustainable choices. The entrepreneurial “anti-capitalists” could even decide to start their own company to compete with the one they disagree with.Crucially, but strangely unnoticed by “anti-capitalist” writers and critics, all these acts of protest are themselves part of the “capitalist system”: they create a demand and consequently force a company to come up with a supply, or they make a new business out of meeting the new demand. This is how markets – free markets – work and are supposed to work. Backlash, consequences, and real stakes are a healthy and necessary part of capitalism.The puzzling thing is that backlash seems not to be associated with capitalism by the anti-capitalist writers and journalists of the world. It is as if they think capitalism is simply a never-ending, stakeless party of increasing supply! The “critical” response to an event like the United and Pepsi backlash, therefore, remains forever stuck in a strangely Pavlovian “away with capitalism!” loop.That the relationship between consumer and company is much more complex than capitalist pigs creating false consciousness to try to steal your money is a point forever lost on mainstream journalism. On the other hand, if a small brand or a leftist popstar like Beyoncé milks the same social justice sentiments for monetary gain, then the mainstream narrative suddenly changes from exploitative and scandalous to empowering and brave.This is when I miss the anti-capitalist sourpusses of old, like Adorno, who was at least consistent in his disgust for any crossover between popular culture and “serious” subjects, however “empowering.” In the cases of Pepsi and United, their faux pas is simply a business opportunity for other market players and a rewarding topic for anti-capitalist journalists and writers everywhere. …Maybe it is time for a fresh approach to critiquing commerce and pop culture. I suggest we observe the following distinction: you are only allowed to cry foul if you are unable to boycott or compete with a service or product. A perfect illustration of the distinction between normal market practices and actual power imbalances is this post by a Facebook user who goes by the name of Max Borders: “Lots of folks boycotting United. A shame you can’t boycott the Chicago Police.”It is safer and easier to take your anger out on something that you as a consumer can actually control, like the brand of soda to buy or the type of airline to book, than it is to react to something you cannot control. This makes the cheap anti-capitalism we’ve seen this past week not only the low-hanging fruit of critical journalism, but it also hinders resistance against those things and institutions that actually threaten the rights and freedoms of individuals. Those are the things that really matter." True link

It’s Democratic, Los Angeles-based Assemblyman Miguel Santiago.Santiago’s bill, AB 1298, would alter the procedures for police disciplinary hearings under state law. During administrative proceedings for police misconduct it would increase the evidentiary threshold to find that a police officer made a false statement. It would increase the threshold from a preponderance of the evidence (more likely than not) to “clear and convincing” evidence (pretty damned sure) to determine that the officer made a false statement.Yes, this is a still a lower threshold for criminal conviction, but these are not criminal cases. These are disciplinary proceedings and civil matters. The Los Angeles Times notes that this higher threshold is similar to what is required by the courts in order to get a restraining order or to lose custody of one’s children.So, clearly, this law would have the net impact of decreasing the likelihood that an officer is found to have been lying. It is being pushed by the Los Angeles Police Protective League. Their spokesman says it’s to protect all those good cops from being punished for mistakes. From the Los Angeles Times:“The result of being found guilty of a false statement is so horrible, you’re going to get fired no matter how many medals you have,” said Gary Ingemunson, independent counsel for the Los Angeles Police Protective League, which is the bill’s principal backer.Ingemunson said the bill would shield officers who were disciplined because they didn’t remember making statements or were being unfairly targeted by management.“Does this make it harder to fire bad cops? My answer to that is this makes it harder to fire good cops,” he said.That’s an interesting assertion to say the least, given that California law significantly shields police officers from public disclosures of their disciplinary records, so it’s kind of hard to prove his claim. The actual state law that oversees police discipline specifically says that police officers may not be punished solely because that officer’s name shows up on any sort of list or record of police who have engaged in misconduct.In fact, at the same time this law is being pitched, the union that represents Los Angeles County deputies is suing in order to keep the sheriff’s office from informing prosecutors of the names of deputies who have been found to have engaged in professional misconduct.In addition, and not mentioned in the Times story, Santiago’s bill would also forbid witness testimony for police disciplinary hearings to be provided by telephone or “any other electronic means.” That sounds like a recipe either for passive-aggressive witness intimidation or an environment where a witness cannot make time or is otherwise physically unable to attend a hearing and therefore will not have claims considered.The Times notes that civil liberties groups aren’t the only ones concerned about the implications of Santiago’s bill. Representatives for sheriffs across the state complained in a hearing for the bill that their communities are attacking them for not dealing with problem officers. This legislation will make it harder." True link

In contrast to the ancient and medieval philosophers, for whom philosophy was the contemplation of reality, the Progressives were animated by the desire to mold reality and to harness knowledge for social betterment. Many in the vanguard of progressive thought initially were enamored of Mussolini and even Hitler, considering their dictatorships a useful “social experiment.”H.G. Wells, the popular science fiction writer, was one. In a number of speeches and books he praised the militaristic social mobilization in the new fascist regimes: an entire society moving as a single unit under the rule of a Nietzschean superman.Complete state control of all aspects of life was seen as highly pragmatic and scientific by many. Nationalism and militarism – elements commonly associated with the Right – were actually key components of the Progressive Era, flourishing in particular under President Woodrow Wilson, as Goldberg documents.Ideological TwinsHitler and Mussolini’s ideologies grew out of the avant-garde progressive and pragmatic philosophies of the late 19th century.Popular wisdom holds that Fascism and Communism were diametrical opposites. Actually, the two ideologies were (and are) so similar that they had to define themselves in opposition to each other in order to survive. At the very least, both were socialistic in origin: Mussolini was immersed in socialism by his father, and the name of Hitler’s party – National Socialist German Workers’ Party – speaks for itself.These regimes fostered hostility to traditional religious beliefs and morality (both men despised Christianity), “salvation by science” (as shown, for example, in the Nazi’s racist eugenics movement), and state-controlled health and environmental projects (as shown in a Nazi slogan, “Nutrition is not a private matter!”).All of these elements grew out of the “scientific” progressivism of the early 20th century. Even the Nazis’ vÖlkisch ideology—with its nationalist and traditionalist overtones – was at heart a secular religion-substitute which enshrined the Will of the People, a concept which Goldberg traces to the French Revolution.It would seem undeniable that Hitler and Mussolini, like the Soviet Union’s Joseph Stalin, were revolutionaries and in no sense conservatives or traditionalists. Their ideologies grew out of the avant-garde positivist, progressive, and pragmatic philosophies of the late 19th century." True link

After the public comment period closes, the FCC will be able to vote on revering those claims and effectively undoing the strained logic that the Obama administration used to asset those powers in the first place. The vote on actually reversing those policies probably won’t happen for several months, at least.“Today’s vote isn’t about net neutrality, but the FCC’s legal authority over the internet,” says Brian Szoka, president of Tech Freedom, a tech policy think tank that favors less regulation. “The real debate is over the FCC’s power.”As Szoka points out, even after the FCC finishes the process of repealing the Obama-era rules, it won’t be the end of government regulation of the Internet. The Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, state attorneys general, and private attorneys will still be able to exert legal and political pressure on ISPs that breach contracts or otherwise violate the rule of law.To understand what’s happening at the FCC under new chairman Ajit Pai, it’s useful to understand how we got to this point. During the Obama administration, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler tried to impose net neutrality—twice—only to have federal courts block both efforts because the FCC lacked the authority to exert such broad control over ISPs. In response, the FCC in 2015 gave itself the authority (after privately working with the White House) to impose net neutrality by reclassifying ISPs as a Title II telecommunications service. With ISPs now subject to the same federal regulations as so-called “common carriers” like telephone services, a third attempt at imposing net neutrality survived a court challenge.“Title II involves the panoply of heavy-handed economic regulations that were developed in the Great Depression to handle Ma Bell, the telephone monopoly of the 1930s,” Pai told Reason TV last month. “My previous colleagues imposed those rules on the internet, one of the most dynamic systems we’ve ever known.”In short, the Obama administration found a clever way to get around limitations on the FCC’s regulatory power. Thursday’s vote is the first step towards putting the FCC’s regulations back within those previous limits. As Pai points out, we weren’t living in a digital dystopia in the years leading up to 2015.Giving the FCC the sole regulatory authority over the Internet never made much sense. Since each new president can appoint new members to the commission, “the question of the FCC’s legal authority will keep ping-ponging back and forth depending on which party controls the FCC,” says Szoka. Just look at what’s happened in the last few years. The FCC imposed net neutrality with party-line votes when a Democrat was in the White House and is now starting to repeal those rules with similar party-line votes from the new Republican majority.That’s no way to run anything, but it could have a particularly chilling effect on the development of the internet, which has grown in incredible and creative ways, in part, because of the lack of regulatory control exerted upon it. Worse, perhaps, than excessive regulatory control would be a lack of regulatory certainty, which would be the result of letting the FCC write and re-write rules for ISPs every four or eight years.If there’s a need and a public desire for net neutrality, those rules should be debated and passed by Congress. Congress could, for example, pass a law to prohibit ISPs from engaging in throttling or peering, and give enforcement authority to the FCC (or the FTC, which might actually make more sense).Until and unless that happens, the Internet will be better off without a single government agency—and one with a track record that’s hardly kind to freedom and free expression—handing itself a blank check to set rules for the web."

The study of mountains in West Antarctica will help scientists improve their predictions of how the region might respond to continuing climate change. Its findings could also show how ice loss might contribute to sea level rise. Although the discovery demonstrates the long-term stability of some parts of Antarctica’s ice sheet, scientists remain concerned that ice at its coastline is vulnerable to rising temperatures. Researchers from the Universities of Edinburgh and Northumbria studied rocks on slopes of the Ellsworth Mountains, whose peaks protrude through the ice sheet. By mapping and analysing surface rocks — including measuring their exposure to cosmic rays – researchers calculated that the mountains have been shaped by an ice sheet over a million-year period, beginning in a climate some 20C warmer than at present. The last time such climates existed in the mountains of Antarctica was 14 million years ago when vegetation grew in the mountains and beetles thrived. Antarctica’s climate at the time would be similar to that of modern day Patagonia or Greenland. " False link

(And not to pile on, but it was a United flight.) Despite papa having her passport, his passport, and a notarized letter from the mom saying that she gave them her permission to travel, the authorities felt compelled to act upon a “tip""—a tip that was nothing more than a passenger’s hysteria-fueled hunch that 3-year-olds are being trafficked right and left in the USA.As the mom, high school teacher Maura Furfey, wrote for The Huffington Post:After our 3-year-old snoozed on her father’s lap for most of the flight, the plane landed. He texted me to tell me they had arrived. When the plane taxied to the gate, however, a number of officers from the Port Authority and Customs and Border Patrol boarded the plane, approached my husband and instructed him to grab his carry-ons and follow them. He and our daughter were escorted out of the plane before anyone else could get off.Once out of the plane, four officers from Port Authority and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) surrounded them. They fired so many questions at him that he didn’t know who was asking what. He had no idea what was going on. Our daughter started to cry in all of the commotion.After asking about where our daughter was born, who was there, and where her birth certificate had been issued, they asked for my phone number; that was when they called me, asking me the same questions in order to verify the story. At that point they seemed satisfied that my husband was not, in fact, trafficking our daughter. They then told me that this accusation was not coming from the CBP, who were trained to identify these kind of situations, but from a passenger on the plane. They were following protocol to act on reported suspicions such as this.So, some questions to mull.When and how can we stop granting credibility to any and all calls to the authorities? Just because someone ""sees something” and “says something” doesn’t mean they are seeing anything truly of note. Let’s not act as if every easily terrified citizen is Sherlock Holmes.How can we dial back the obsession with sex trafficking? I was at a discussion of trafficking the other night and the number bandied about was “150,000 children a year in the US are trafficked.” But that’s a wild over-estimation. Here is Reason’s Elizabeth Nolan Brown on the subject. She notes that while lawmakers used to cite 300,000 sex trafficking victims, that number was:based on 1990s data published in a non-peer-reviewed paper that the primary researcher, Richard Estes, no longer endorses. The authors of that study came up with their number by speculating that certain situations—i.e., living in public housing, being a runaway, having foreign parents—place minors at risk of potential exploitation by sex traffickers. They then simply counted up the number of kids in those situations. To make a bad measure worse, anyone who fell into more than one category was counted multiple times.Now they just fudge the numbers. Wrote Brown, “These days, federal agencies tend to stick to the vague ‘thousands’ when discussing numbers of incoming victims.”Obviously, any trafficked young person is a scandal, but as Sandi Rozek, communications director for NARSOL, the National Association for Rational Sex Offense Laws, points out: “The saddest thing is that we finally reached the point where fathers are as connected to their children as mothers are. There are even diaper changing tables in some men’s restrooms!” Just watch out for all the onlookers who assume they are living in an action movie, constantly witnessing nefarious crimes being played out in public right in front of them.Isn’t flying United enough of an adrenaline rush all by itself?"

His target was not the tax itself, but the principle behind it. Since its implementation in 1913, he wrote, “The government says to the citizen: ‘Your earnings are not exclusively your own; we have a claim on them, and our claim precedes yours; we will allow you to keep some of it, because we recognize your need, not your right; but whatever we grant you for yourself is for us to decide.”He really does have a point. That’s evil. When Congress ratified the 16th Amendment on Feb. 3, 1913, there was a sense in which all private income in the U.S. was nationalized. What was not taxed from then on was a favor granted unto us, and continues to be so.This is implied in the text of the amendment itself: ""The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.”No LimitsWhere are the limits? There weren’t any. There was some discussion about putting a limit on the tax, but it seemed unnecessary. Only 1% of the income earners would end up paying about 1% to the government. Everyone else was initially untouched. Who really cares that the rich have to pay a bit more, right? They can afford it.This perspective totally misunderstands the true nature of government, which always wants more money and more power and will stop at nothing to get both. The 16th Amendment was more than a modern additive to an antique document. It was a new philosophy of the fiscal life of the entire country.Today, the ruling elite no longer bothers with things like amendments. But back in the day, it was different. The amendment was made necessary because of previous court decisions that stated what was once considered a bottom-line presumption of the free society: Government cannot tax personal property. What you make is your own. You get to keep the product of your labors. Government can tax sales, perhaps, or raise money through tariffs on goods coming in and out of the country. But your bank account is off-limits.The amendment changed that idea. In the beginning, it applied to very few people. This was one reason it passed. It was pitched as a replacement tax, not a new money raiser. After all the havoc caused by the divisive tariffs of the 19th century, this sounded like a great deal to many people, particularly Southerners and Westerners fed up with paying such high prices for manufactured goods while seeing their trading relations with foreign consumers disrupted.People who supported it – and they were not so much the left but the right-wing populists of the time – imagined that the tax would hit the robber baron class of industrialists in the North. And that it did. Their fortunes began to dwindle, and their confidence in their ability to amass and retain intergenerational fortunes began to wane.Limit to AccumulationWe all know the stories of how the grandchildren of the Gilded Age tycoons squandered their family heritage in the 1920s and failed to carry on the tradition. Well, it is hardly surprising. The government put a timetable and limit on accumulation. Private families and individuals would no longer be permitted to exist except in subjugation to the taxing state. The kids left their private estates to live in the cities, put off marriage, stopped bothering with all that hearth and home stuff. Time horizons shortened, and the Jazz Age began.Class warfare was part of the deal from the beginning. The income tax turned the social fabric of the country into a giant lifetime boat, with everyone arguing about who had to be thrown overboard so that others might live.The demon in the beginning was the rich. That remained true until the 1930s, when FDR changed the deal. Suddenly, the income would be collected, but taxed in a different way. It would be taken from everyone, but a portion would be given back late in life as a permanent income stream. Thus was the payroll tax born. This tax today is far more significant than the income tax.The class warfare unleashed all those years ago continues today. One side wants to tax the rich. The other side finds it appalling that the percentage of people who pay no income tax has risen from 30% to nearly 50%. Now we see the appalling spectacle of Republicans regarding this as a disgrace that must change. They have joined the political classes that seek advancement by hurting people.The Payroll TaxIt’s extremely strange that the payroll tax is rarely considered in this debate. The poor, the middle class and the rich are all being hammered by payroll taxes that fund failed programs that provide no security and few benefits at all.It’s impossible to take seriously the claims that the income tax doesn’t harm wealth creation. When Congress wants to discourage something – smoking, imports, selling stocks or whatever – they know what to do: Tax it. Tax income, and on the margin, you discourage people from earning it.Tax debates are always about “reform” – which always means a slight shift in who pays what, with an eye to raising ever more money for the government. A far better solution would be to forget the whole thing and return to the original idea of a free society: You get to keep what you earn or inherit. That means nothing short of abolishing the great mistake of 1913.Forget the flat tax. The only just solution is no tax on incomes ever.But let’s say that one day we actually become safe from the income tax collectors and something like blessed peace arrives. There is still another problem that emerged in 1913. Congress created the Federal Reserve, which eventually developed the power to create all the money that government would ever need, even without taxing.For the practical running of the affairs of the state, the Fed is far worse than the income tax. It creates the more-insidious tax because it is so sneaky. In a strange way, it has made all the debates about taxation superfluous. Denying the government revenue does nothing to curb its appetites for our liberties and property. The Fed has managed to make it impossible to starve the beast.Chodorov was correct about the evil of the income tax. Its passage signaled the beginning of a century of despotism. Our property is no longer safe. Our income is not our own. We are legally obligated to turn over whatever our masters say we owe them. You can fudge this point: None of this is compatible with the old liberal idea of freedom.You doubt it? Listen to Thomas Jefferson from his inaugural address of 1801. What he said then remains true today:“…what more is necessary to make us a happy and a prosperous people? Still one more thing, fellow citizens a wise and frugal government, which shall restrain men from injuring one another, shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned.”" True link

You’re sitting at home at night, and there’s a knock at the door. You open the door, and a guy with a gun pointed at you says: “Give me your money. I want to give it away to the less fortunate.” You think he’s dangerous and crazy, so you call the police. Then you find out he is the police, there to collect your taxes.The framers of the Constitution understood this. For 150 years, the federal government was run by user fees and sales of government land and assessments to the states for services rendered. It rejected the Hamiltonian view that the feds could take whatever they wanted, and it followed the Jeffersonian first principle that the only moral commercial exchanges are those that are fully voluntary.This worked well until the progressives took over the government in the first decade of the 20th century. They persuaded enough Americans to cause their state legislatures to ratify the Sixteenth Amendment, which was designed to tax the rich and redistribute wealth. They promised the American public that the income tax would never exceed 3 percent of income and would only apply to the top 3 percent of earners. How wrong – or deceptive – they were.Yet, the imposition of a federal income tax is more than just taking from those who work and earn and giving to those who don’t. And it is more than just a spigot to fill the federal trough. At its base, it is a terrifying presumption. It presumes that we don’t really own our property. It accepts the Marxist notion that the state owns all the property and the state permits us to keep and use whatever it needs us to have so we won’t riot in the streets. And then it steals and uses whatever it can politically get away with. Do you believe this?There are only three ways to acquire wealth in a free society. The inheritance model occurs when someone gives you wealth. The economic model occurs when you trade a skill, a talent, an asset, knowledge, sweat, energy or creativity to a willing buyer. And the mafia model occurs when a guy with a gun says: “Give me your money or else.”Which model does the government use? Why do we put up with this?" True link

No more and no less. For what is “robbery”? Robbery is the taking of a man’s property by the use of violence or the threat thereof, and therefore without the victim’s consent. And yet what else is taxation?Those who claim that taxation is, in some mystical sense, really “voluntary” should then have no qualms about getting rid of that vital feature of the law which says that failure to pay one’s taxes is criminal and subject to appropriate penalty. But does anyone seriously believe that if the payment of taxation were really made voluntary, say in the sense of contributing to the American Cancer Society, that any appreciable revenue would find itself into the coffers of government? Then why don’t we try it as an experiment for a few years, or a few decades, and find out?But if taxation is robbery, then it follows as the night the day that those people who engage in, and live off, robbery are a gang of thieves. Hence the government is a group of thieves, and deserves, morally, aesthetically, and philosophically, to be treated exactly as a group of less socially respectable ruffians would be treated."

While that assassination created widespread debate — the once-again-beloved ACLU sued Obama to restrain him from the assassination on the ground of due process and then, when that suit was dismissed, sued Obama again after the killing was carried out — another drone killing carried out shortly thereafter was perhaps even more significant yet generated relatively little attention.Two weeks after the killing of Awlaki, a separate CIA drone strike in Yemen killed his 16-year-old American-born son, Abdulrahman, along with the boy’s 17-year-old cousin and several other innocent Yemenis. The U.S. eventually claimed that the boy was not their target but merely “collateral damage.” Abdulrahman’s grief-stricken grandfather, Nasser al-Awlaki, urged the Washington Post “to visit a Facebook memorial page for Abdulrahman,” which explained: “Look at his pictures, his friends, and his hobbies. His Facebook page shows a typical kid.”Few events pulled the mask off Obama officials like this one. It highlighted how the Obama administration was ravaging Yemen, one of the world’s poorest countries: just weeks after he won the Nobel Prize, Obama used cluster bombs that killed 35 Yemeni women and children. Even Obama-supporting liberal comedians mocked the arguments of the Obama DOJ for why it had the right to execute Americans with no charges: “Due Process Just Means There’s A Process That You Do,” snarked Stephen Colbert. And a firestorm erupted when former Obama press secretary Robert Gibbs offered a sociopathic justification for killing the Colorado-born teenager, apparently blaming him for his own killing by saying he should have “had a more responsible father.”The U.S. assault on Yemeni civilians not only continued but radically escalated over the next five years through the end of the Obama presidency, as the U.S. and the U.K. armed, supported, and provide crucial assistance to their close ally Saudi Arabia as it devastated Yemen through a criminally reckless bombing campaign. Yemen now faces mass starvation, seemingly exacerbated, deliberately, by the U.S.-U.K.-supported air attacks. Because of the West’s direct responsibility for these atrocities, they have received vanishingly little attention in the responsible countries.In a hideous symbol of the bipartisan continuity of U.S. barbarism, Nasser al-Awlaki just lost another one of his young grandchildren to U.S. violence. On Sunday, the Navy’s SEAL Team 6, using armed Reaper drones for cover, carried out a commando raid on what it said was a compound harboring officials of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. A statement issued by President Trump lamented the death of an American service member and several others who were wounded, but made no mention of any civilian deaths. U.S. military officials initially denied any civilian deaths, and (therefore) the CNN report on the raid said nothing about any civilians being killed.But reports from Yemen quickly surfaced that 30 people were killed, including 10 women and children. Among the dead: the 8-year-old granddaughter of Nasser al-Awlaki, Nawar, who was also the daughter of Anwar Awlaki.As noted by my colleague Jeremy Scahill — who extensively interviewed the grandparents in Yemen for his book and film on Obama’s “Dirty Wars” —  the girl “was shot in the neck and killed,” bleeding to death over the course of two hours. “Why kill children?” the grandfather asked. “This is the new (U.S.) administration — it’s very sad, a big crime.”A “hideous symbol of the bipartisan continuity of U.S. barbarism,” indeed."

He was a journalist, broadcaster, editor, musician, father, husband, and self-described Christian Individualist. He was also my hero.Will’s main beat was stories about individual victims of the state: particularly Americans who have been unjustly imprisoned or wrongfully assaulted by government officers. His research for each article was exhaustive. From his home in Idaho, he traveled all around the northwest to get the story in person. He would get to know each subject personally, and seek face-to-face interviews with their powerful persecutors. His tireless work has saved several innocent lives from being slowly drained away in prison. He wrote so many pieces about Christopher Tapp, a man who has spent two decades in prison for a murder he did not commit, that the Libertarian Institute, where he was managing editor, will publish a whole book collecting them.Each essay he wrote was a masterpiece of erudition and eloquence, precision and passion. He did not hurl invective. He simply described each official injustice exactly, stripped of all euphemism, as one would a crime committed by any “mundane” outside of the “punitive priesthood” and devoid of “blue privilege,” to use three of his many incisive coinages. He would illuminate the matter by drawing fascinating parallels from his expansive knowledge of history, literature, and popular culture: especially science fiction, which he loved. And he would slice to pieces the officious justifications of official victimizers with his razor-sharp reason. He was, bar none, the best writer in the liberty movement. And in his painstakingly produced podcast Freedom Zealot and his many interviews with Scott Horton, he seemed to craft final-draft prose as he spoke.As his colleague Sheldon Richman wrote upon his passing, Will Grigg was, “Principled. Committed. Indefatigable.” It’s true. More than any other writer, Will represented moral true north for me. He suffered much financial hardship for his adamantine insistence upon saying what was right and true.One of his many fans summed him up as, “Fearless. Loving. Genuine.” Also spot on. He made some very powerful and vindictive individuals very angry in his struggles for justice. It only made him fight harder. His sign-off for every essay and podcast was “Dum spiro pugno: While I breathe, I fight.” And indeed, he fought magnificently for justice and liberty until he breathed his last.Yet, he was also the sweetest, most gentle man you’d ever meet. He was a warm, adoring father to his children, about whom he wrote moving tributes on Facebook, and a strong, caring husband to his wife. He was a virtuoso on the electric guitar, on which he performed his own soundtrack for his podcast. And his many friends would share videos of adorable animals to his Facebook profile to see what kind of reaction they’d get in the comments from Will, who would always find a new humorous way to express his utter devastation at the sheer cuteness of the creature.He was just a wonderful, wonderful man.To help support Will’s large family, you can donate to his family fund."

Crack the door to admit Elliott Abrams and the neocons will scurry in by the hundreds.Neoconservative interventionists have had us at perpetual war for 25 years. While President Trump has repeatedly stated his belief that the Iraq War was a mistake, the neocons (all of them Never-Trumpers) continue to maintain that the Iraq and Libyan Wars were brilliant ideas. These are the same people who think we must blow up half the Middle East, then rebuild it and police it for decades.They’re wrong and they should not be given a voice in this administration. …Elliott Abrams is a neoconservative too long in the tooth to change his spots, and the president should have no reason to trust that he would carry out a Trump agenda rather than a neocon agenda.But just as importantly, Congress has good reason not to trust him — he was convicted of lying to Congress in his previous job.His conviction for deceiving Congress over secret arms deals, better known as the Iran-Contra scandal, show that his neocon agenda trumps his fidelity to the rule of law. The Constitution directs Congress to approve or disapprove of war. It would be a mistake to appoint anyone to the State Department who was previously convicted for defying Congressional authority.Nation building in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria and Yemen has not and will not work. Mr. President please, please do not open the door to the people who sip lattes while sneering behind your back. They are bold enough to come begging for work while continuing to laugh and deride your every remark concerning foreign policy. Don’t let them in!The neocon trademark is to conduct war in secret to avoid congressional scrutiny. This is exactly what happened during Iran-Contra. Despite legislation that prohibited sending arms to Nicaragua, Abrams and other neocons surreptitiously funneled money from sultans in Brunei to sheiks in Iran, converting the cash into weapons that were then sent to authoritarians in Nicaragua. Abrams also supervised, covered up and defended a policy of arming a Guatemalan government undeniably waging war against an indigenous native population. Thousands of the indigenous people of the Ixil region of Guatemala were exterminated. The Guatemalan President was eventually convicted of war crimes. Abrams was an unabashed supporter and organizer of sending arms into this tragic situation.In a country of 300 million people, surely there are reasonable foreign policy experts who have not been convicted of deceiving Congress and actually share the president’s foreign policy views. I hope Secretary Rex Tillerson will continue the search for expert assistance from experienced, non-convicted diplomats who understand the mistakes of the past and the challenges ahead." True link

An excerpt:  Because [Rep. Justin] Amash has an R after his name and so does the President-elect, many people undoubtedly assumed he would vote for the [Mattis defense secretary] waiver along with everyone else. After all, that’s how this works, right? If you’re a Republican in Congress, you’re supposed to vote for what a Republican president wants. If you’re a Democrat, same deal for a Democratic president. If partisanship is a representative’s guiding value, that makes a lot of sense. But if a member of Congress, like Amash, is voting based not on party but principle—well then it’s crazy talk. What Amash realizes and too many of his colleagues on both sides of the aisle are eager to ignore is the fact that rule of law is so much more important than making life easy for a president who happens to be in the same party as you. Maintaining (or, at this point, regaining) “a government of laws and not of men,” as Founding Father John Adams famously put it, is a much bigger deal than making sure Donald Trump gets exactly the defense secretary he prefers. Amash’s vote might be dismissed as nit-picky, and it is certainly true that it is inconsequential in terms of the fate of the Mattis waiver, which easily passed both houses of Congress. But it is emblematic of the sort of winnowing I expect we’ll see in coming days as divisions emerge between politicians who operate out of partisanship and true public servants who are motivated by principle.
