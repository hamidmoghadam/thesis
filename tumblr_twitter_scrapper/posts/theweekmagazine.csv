The bottom are immigrants and the media elite?Trump himself may have “outranked” Kovaleski, but Trump’s supporters are another matter entirely. Plenty of them come from the most economically devastated parts of the country. In fact, one of the most reliable statistical predictors of support for Trump in a given county are rates of death by suicide, drugs, and alcohol. These people are literally killing themselves out of despair.Meanwhile the cities inhabited by Streep, and myself, and everyone who cheered her last night are flourishing. All significant cultural production — movies, music, art, news, politics, etc — is created in the major city centers and then beamed out to everyone else. All serious economic activity occurs there as well.In any other context where someone with privilege was criticizing people with little-to-none, liberalism would rightly insist on doing so with great care and humility. It might insist on just avoiding the topic altogether. But Streep did the opposite and even made herself and her fellow media elites the underdogs.(Keep reading.)" True text

And if my emails and Twitter mentions are any indication, they’re the angriest bunch of winners you’ve ever encountered; given how mad they are you would think they’d lost. What Trump gave them was permission to vent their feelings, offered from the highest level, and his victory has made the permission even broader.For years, conservatives have been perturbed by “political correctness,” which in practice usually means someone calling you out when you act like a horrid human being. Egged on by the likes of Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly, they came to believe that it was an immensely powerful force of oppression, to the point where many will say that white people suffer more discrimination than black people in America today. Donald Trump said to them, sometimes literally and sometimes by implication, that they could do almost anything and excuse it by saying that any objection was nothing more than political correctness. Punch that protester? Sure, go ahead — he had it coming! Buy yourself a “Trump That Bitch” T-shirt? You’re a rebel, don’t let The Man tell you what you can’t wear! Celebrate with a Nazi salute? Well…maybe that’s going a little far, but we get you — economic anxiety, right?And now some of Trump’s supporters have decided that you don’t have to be at a rally to let your flag fly. If you’re driving by someone who looks like an immigrant, or you hear people speaking Spanish, or a woman gets in your way on the street, there’s no need to be polite — that’s so 2015. Just tell them what you really think of them, watch them recoil in horror and fear, and feel the rush of power course through you.They know that his campaign wasn’t really about jobs, or about foreign policy, or about health care. It was about whether this is your country and you can tell anyone who doesn’t belong to get the hell out — or at least tell them that you’re in charge and they’d better watch it. More people may have voted for Hillary Clinton, but Trump won, so you’d better treat me with the deference I deserve and know your place. And if I want to yell at you or insult you or maybe do something even worse, then that’s my prerogative. Because this is Trump’s time.(Keep reading.)" True text

Sabotaged a colleague? Pushed a former lover in front of a subway train? Seduced his hapless Secret Service bodyguard? It could have been any or all of the above; House of Cards’ anti-hero (and his equally despicable wife) are just bad people. So bad. I chant this mantra out loud at least twice during each and every episode I’ve watched since then, and I think it to myself often as I eagerly anticipate the series’ upcoming fifth season: They’re so bad. SO BAD.Cards isn’t the only series I follow. Game of Thrones also has me in its gruesome, draconic thrall. I’m totally into The Walking Dead, too. And apparently I’m not the only American who appreciates shows chock full of evil and gore. The aforementioned have all just been nominated for multiple Emmy Awards, with Thrones garnering the most nods of any program, including one for Best Drama.Apparently it’s good to be bad these days. Programs that skew grim also consistently dominate ratings. Orange is the New Black? Women in prison, check. Marco Polo? “Greed, betrayal, sexual intrigue, and rivalry,” check. Mr. Robot? Mentally ill, drug-addicted antihero … check, check, and double-check.The fascination with theatrical badness seems counterintuitive, given how much horror the real world has to offer at present. Why do we want to watch Vikings raping and pillaging when ISIS is actually doing plenty of that in real time? Who needs Pretty Little Liars when we have Kardashians? We keep Calling Saul, when our own elected officials and nominees to public office regularly demonstrate far more self-interested ambition and moral ambiguity than any fictional character could ever play on TV.(Keep reading.)"

One is the giant backlash against the feminist pressure that made the movie possible in the first place. It’s a backlash that shares a lot of DNA with the Gamergate movement, but there’s more to it. While gamers vs. feminists might constitute the immediate backdrop to the Ghostbusters Wars, the movie is fighting a bigger demon: the angst of a generation obsessed with its own nostalgic ghosts.Remakes themselves are ghostbusters. They make consumers of the product they’re supplanting anxious. If you’re old enough to have experienced the original, what any remake communicates is that your pleasure — your sense of fun — is literally incomprehensible to a new generation. It needs to be translated. Worse, it needs to be updated, tuned to the present clime. Remakes don’t just measure our age, then; they measure the distance the culture has drifted from a phenomenon with which we once connected.

The result, however, feels anything but patchwork, as the group delivers its most potent blend of folk and psychedelia yet. Vocalists Anna Rochinski and Shane Butler take turns leading the four-piece through impeccable arrangements of meditative drones, fluttering flutes, and lush strings. It’s no wonder, then, that instrumentation matters deeply to the band. Below, Rochinski and Butler offer six instrumental tracks that inspire them:1. Date Palms, “Honey Devash”Rochinski: “I like to put this record on at night when I need to chill out. They remind me of another band I like called Expo 70. I saw them play in Allston [Massachusetts] at a vintage store a few years ago and loved it. It’s kind of like Brightblack Morning Light without the singing and is much more mantric — you can really get into the space they create here. It’s like drone music with much more movement.”2. Miles Davis, “Shhh/Peaceful”Rochinski: “One of my favorite tracks off one of my favorite albums by one of my favorite musicians. Every time I listen to this album I hear something new. This album lifts me up. What is there to even say. Miles is really important to me.”3. Arzachel, “Queen St. Gang”Rochinski: “Pretty straightforward groovy jam. But immensely satisfying, nonetheless. My favorite track off of their album. Would be a good tune to take a leisurely bike ride with. Makes me nostalgic for living in Cambridge, when it was in almost daily rotation in my old apartment.”See the full list here." True text

The minimum would be linked to inflation from there on out. Itremains a political agreement between the stakeholders, and the statutory language still has to actually pass the legislature.But if it holds, this will basically put all the major arguments against the minimum wage to a real-world test.To understand how, let’s review how skepticism of the minimum wage debate has evolved over time.It started out as a classical Economic 101 argument: If you raise the price of widgets, demand for widgets will drop and people will buy less of them. Ergo the same logic should apply to labor: Raising its price will reduce demand for it, which means less job creation and higher unemployment.It didn’t work out that way: Research on real-world examples of minimum wage hikes has had enormous trouble pinning down any effect on employment. The reason for this really ought to be intuitive: Labor isn’t widgets. Labor is people.This means that minimum wage hikes essentially force employers to give employees a bigger slice of a business’ earnings, putting more money in the pockets of workers down the income ladder. Since the vast majority of households that stand to benefit from a minimum wage hike have very low savings rates, basically all the money from the increase goes into more consumption. This means more aggregate demand — which means more jobs.Keep reading." True text

The idea is that working-class towns and communities are dysfunctional and dying, and there’s nothing for residents to do but move to greener pastures. Nor has it just been right-wingers making this argument. Adherents include economist Tyler Cowen, Bloomberg’s Justin Fox, and even a few liberals like Mother Jones’ Kevin Drum.More broadly, reform-minded conservatives worry about the long decline in Americans moving to find work, and suggest solutions like relocation vouchers (basically, cash grants to families to help them move).But let’s back up for a moment and examine the implicit assumption here. No economy is a perfectly flat plane when it comes to the distribution of jobs. In America, as with anywhere else, there are peaks and valleys: More jobs in major cities and industrial hubs than in rural states and small towns, for instance. But it’s always been that way, and probably always will be. This debate assumes something new has happened: that the geographic disparities in opportunity have become so bad that Americans in some places have no choice but to just get the hell out.Keep reading."

That’s far less than the 21 percent Trump had in his third-place finish in Minnesota.Why was Utah so hostile to Trump’s candidacy? It turns out that Utah profiles as one of the worst states for The Donald. Utah, while racially homogenous with a religious core that defines the state’s ethos, makes plenty of room for minority religions. It has a low-friction, cohesive social order, a strong economy, and stronger social institutions. Utah’s unemployment rate is 3.4 percent. It was one of the first states to feel an economic rebound from the 2008 financial crash. That rebound has been sustained and attracts new growth from within the state due to internal migration.

Mormons.Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints make up nearly 63 percent of Utah’s population, while Idaho and Wyoming (where Trump lost by large margins in earlier contests) rank second and third, respectively, for states with highest proportion of Mormons.That leaves just two problems with the Grand Plan to bring down Trump using Mormon Power: The LDS are a tiny minority in the rest of the country, and these three Mormon-heavy states command a mere 101 delegates among them.Message: The GOP needs more Mormons!Which is, of course, impossible on such short notice.But it’s still worth taking a moment to reflect on why it is that of all the demographic segments within the Republican electoral coalition it is Latter-day Saints — and not the young, the old, women, moderates, conservatives, evangelical Protestants, or secularists — who’ve proven largely immune to Trump’s appeal.Keep reading. " True text
