And we already know  that he “didn’t want to jinx himself” with too much preparation  pre-win. According to a source closely connected to the Trump transition  team, though, the reality of the situation is worse than we might have  feared. Apparently—as the Wall Street Journal has reported—Trump and his team really are just now learning what a president is even technically allowed to do.  Immediately after Tuesday’s election, members of Trump’s team were  given the task of readying the president-elect for his transition to the  White House. But in the hours-long meetings that followed, outside  advisors tasked with helping the team were horrified to learn just how  little the people getting ready to run the federal government actually  knew.  “They are blatantly unprepared and don’t really have any  sort of plan at all so far,” our source told us. “The best illustration  is there were no prepared policy statements or papers. Whereas in 2012  Romney’s team had hundreds of pages worth of federal policy transitions  planned and written out, Trump’s team had (as of Wednesday) literally no  pages. “Also his team’s grasp of federal powers is fairly paltry. They had  hours long meetings with outside advisors to figure out what could and  couldn’t be delegated to Pence, what the president could do  unilaterally, etc. One of Trump’s advisors said as recently as last  weekend that they were planning on what to do after the election with  the assumption that Trump would lose, and had no real plan for a  victory.”  it’s truly the end of times " False link
