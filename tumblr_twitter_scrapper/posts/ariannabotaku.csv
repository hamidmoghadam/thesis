ariannabotaku 161031994387 "2017-05-24 20:30:32 GMT" https://ariannabotaku.tumblr.com/post/161031994387/forget-the-myths-what-adhd-is-actually-like "neurodiversitysci: hobbitsaarebas:  phynali:  palpablenotion:  eglantinebr:  killergabite:  neurodiversitysci:                   This started life as a more accessible version of my ADHD list for writers, and turned into a two-part series. That’s how ADHD works sometimes. This is part 1. 1. We’re not all hyperactive, extraverted little boys. We can be: Adults Female Not hyperactive (this is called Inattentive type).  Introverts Another myth is that men have hyperactive or combined ADHD and women have inattentive ADHD. But there are men with inattentive ADHD and women with hyperactive or combined ADHD. They’re just less common. Yet another myth is that people with ADHD lose their hyperactive symptoms by the time they grow up. Many do, but there are still adults with combined type around.  2. Some of us get good grades and behave well in school. A common myth about ADHD is that we’re just misbehaving kids who need to be spanked more. Nonsense like this: But actually, many of us looked more like this in school, especially if we had Inattentive type ADHD. When bored, we can daydream, look out the window, or doodle. Teachers might not notice us, or might even enjoy teaching us.   Furthermore, some people with ADHD are smart, learn easily, and are interested in school. This lets them get good grades…until the demands to turn organized work in on time become too overwhelming.  3. We can pay attention. We just can’t regulate our attention. Some parents and doctors claim a child can’t have ADHD if they can focus on video games for hours. Nothing can be further from the truth. If anything, we have trouble stopping! We can focus for hours on something that interests us. Or on procrastinating.  But we’re worse than most people at focusing on things that are boring or unimportant to us.  We also have difficulty controlling the amount of attention we pay. Our attention works like this: When we pay full-on attention, it’s called “hyperfocus.” Hyperfocus is great when you’re writing a paper, but exhausting when you’re doing mindless tasks like washing dishes or checking e-mail.  4. We don’t always think fast, talk fast, or have lots of energy.                  Some of us struggle with fatigue and slow processing speed. In fact, a new subtype of ADHD, Sluggish Cognitive Tempo, was proposed to describe this problem. The stereotype about ADHD is that we can’t focus because there are too many thoughts and sensations in our heads, and we keep jumping from one to another.  But those of us who fit the Sluggish Cognitive Tempo description can be distracted for very different reasons. Imagine how you feel after getting only three hours of sleep several nights in a row. You probably feel groggy, have very few thoughts moving through your head, and respond slowly when people talk to you. You probably have trouble concentrating, multitasking, remembering to do things, and making decisions. Instead of having too many thoughts, and noticing too many things, you have too few. You just feel like you don’t have the energy to pay attention to anything. That’s what it’s like. This experience is sometimes called “brain fog.” We can also have inconsistent processing speed.  Sometimes, I think and talk so fast it irritates other people. Everything feels like it’s happening in slow motion and I get bored. I interrupt other people because I’ve already processed what they’re saying before they finish, and I don’t realize it’s my listening that’s finished, not their talking.  Other times, I am just about to answer someone’s question when they irritably repeat themselves, or ask why I’m taking so long to answer. It feels like I’m thinking at normal speed, but other people’s reactions make clear that I’m going too slow.   5. We’re not all athletic adrenaline junkies. There’s a stereotype that we’re adrenaline junkies who perform surgeries, jump out of planes, or travel round the world starting new businesses.    First of all, many of us have delays or disabilities with motor coordination. As children, people with ADHD can have difficulty with: Using scissors Handwriting Tying shoes Throwing or catching a ball Riding a bike Second, when you look at the people with ADHD who fit this stereotype, what do they have in common? Most are men, with high energy and either hyperactive/impulsive or combined type ADHD. Even in mice, male and female brains react to stress differently. It’s possible that men, who tend to externalize, are more likely to thrive on stress. By contrast, women tend to internalize, and might get overwhelmed instead. Up to a certain point, increasing stress helps you focus. That’s why some people wait until the last minute to study for exams. But past a certain amount, becoming more stressed starts to hurt you. And long term, living under high stress hurts both your physical and mental health. Some people with ADHD rely on increasing their stress levels to get stuff done. A disability services counselor I met in graduate school actually recommended this strategy to me.  She should have known better. Even if you benefit from putting yourself under stress, you will pay steep long-term costs. Having seen family and friends pay them, I don’t think the costs are worth it.  TL;DR, Not all of us benefit from stress, so we don’t all seek it out.  6. Some of us are socially awkward penguins, not social butterflies. Another stereotype describes us as social butterflies who hide our school difficulties by playing class clown or making friends with everyone. But some of us are socially awkward. We can come off as awkward or rude because we’re not paying attention and miss cues. We can have poor sense of timing and inconsistent processing speed. These can make us interrupt other people, or just seem weird. We can be annoying. We interrupt other people, talk too much, change subjects often, or zone out in the middle of a conversation. Like elderly people, we can tell you the same thing many times because we forgot we told you. We also often forget what you tell us. It takes heroic effort to remember, say, friends’ birthdays. As a result, many of us have mild social difficulties that don’t meet criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder.   People with ADHD are also more likely to be on the autism spectrum.   7. Being diagnosed and labeled can improve our lives. People worry about letting their child be diagnosed or labeled, because they think it will make people treat their child worse. But when you actually talk to people with ADHD, many of them had a very different experience. Having the label is a relief. It gives you understanding. It gives you words to describe your experiences for the first time. It means you’re not broken. It means there are other people like you. The title of a popular ADHD book, “You mean I’m not lazy, stupid, or crazy?” describes the feeling well.                  I’ve written about how bad it is to grow up without a diagnosis, and how good it feels to get one, here, here, and here.  8. Stimulants don’t turn you into a zombie, but they’re not a cure, either. If a person with ADHD gets the right medication at the right dose, they don’t turn into zombies. They just become a better-functioning version of themselves. But stimulants don’t cure ADHD. Yes, if taken for a long time, they do create changes in the brain. But the person still has the same underlying characteristics. If they stop taking stimulants, their ADHD symptoms will become visible again. Stimulants, like antidepressants, should be thought of like insulin for diabetics. They’re not a cure, and they need to be taken long-term. But they help you manage your symptoms and live a full life.  9. Stimulants aren’t the only way to manage ADHD, and some of us choose not to take them. Some people with ADHD choose not to take stimulants. And it’s not just because they hate drug companies or fear that the drugs will turn them into a different person. First of all, only 80% of people with ADHD respond to stimulants. The other fifth can try other kinds of medications. These include: wakefulness medications (like Provigil),medications that treat mood disorders (like Welbutrin),Non-stimulants designed to treat ADHD (Strattera, Concerta)Non-stimulants are less powerful than stimulants, so they reduce ADHD symptoms less, but they also have fewer side effects. Which brings me to the main reason people with ADHD avoid stimulants: side effects. Stimulants activate the sympathetic nervous system—the one involved in the fight or flight response. As a result, you can get the following side effects: Increased heart rateIncreased anxietyLoss of appetiteIncreased rate of headaches and migrainesWeight lossNote: These symptoms are probably the reason for the claim that stimulants stunt children’s growth. If we’re not taking stimulants, you might see us consuming huge quantities of more socially acceptable drugs: caffeine and nicotine. That person who goes through a pot of coffee a day, always has a Pepsi in hand, or can’t quit smoking?  They might be self-medicating their ADHD.  Please share this information and help combat myths about ADHD.  This sounds very familiar  Best explanation I have ever seen. Describes me and my whole family.   Can someone explain the caffeine self medicating topic?  Caffeine is a stimulant and can be used in place of other medical stimulants. Even people without ADHD can use it to help them focus, but some people drink a lot more than they might otherwise “need” because they rely on it to help them focus or modulate their attention. I try to keep an eye on my caffeine intake but definitely use it to self-medicate and drink more than many people my size.  Another friend of mine with undiagnosed ADHD can go through pots of the stuff.  Much as I appreciate the information in this post, I don’t appreciate its binarism and cissexism, especially in phrasing like “male and female brains.” There is no such thing as a male brain or a female brain. Different individuals express their ADHD differently, and while yes, some of those differences occur along gender lines, I think that can be attributed to social training/privilege and hormone levels. Hormones and social training/privilege both have a profound impact on our emotions, beliefs, and physiological responses, and account for the observable differences between cis men and women.   First of all, @hobbitsaarebas, thanks for the helpful feedback. It sounds like the post came across in ways I didn’t intend and didn’t think about clarifying while writing. (TBH, my main concern was keeping everything concise, given my ADHD audience). I hope this reply will address your concerns, even though I’m not 100% clear on where you’re talking about sex and where you’re talking about gender. You might have noticed that the post talks separately about sex and gender. I discuss sex only in regards to response to anxiety, and gender in terms of social influences like who gets diagnosed, how other people interpret their behavior, etc. So, the points about sex aren’t intended to apply only to cis people. Because this is a point about biology, not culture or identity, a person could have, say, a “female” pattern whether they are a man, woman, nonbinary, transgendered or cisgendered, etc. I probably should have said that explicitly. (I also understand that the effects of gender will change if/when a person changes gender identities, and might apply in more complicated ways to trans people. I also don’t have the research knowledge or life experience to talk about that. If you do, I’d like to hear about it).  You’re absolutely right, mice and humans are very different because as far as we know, mice just have biological sex variables like hormones and neural growth patterns in response to stress. But humans layer other things on top, like concepts of gender, and different socialization for males and females. You’re right, I should have said this explicitly. It feels like a truism to me, but on the internet, no one knows what’s obvious to you. ;)   I also want to add, biological sex differences in the brain are often overstated, and are used to explain human behaviors that go way beyond any sort of brain-behavior mechanism we know about, and could be explained way more parsimoniously by culture. You were saying there’s no such thing as a man or female brain. I would say that “male” and “female” brains exist, only in the sense that there are differences in hormones and neural growth patterns between the brains that come with a male body versus a female body. Not in the sense that people like Simon Baron-Cohen or many evolutionary psychologists talk about it. The mouse research is the only specific difference I know of that seems both real and relevant to humans, and there are lots of other influences on how men and women deal with stress, too.  I think (and probably discuss in the post?) that gender can be a powerful social force with huge effects on who gets diagnosed when, how their behavior is interpreted, and how they learn to cope or compensate. Anecdotally, I see and hear about such gender differences often.  I do have a bias from personal experience, though, in thinking about gender as concepts that are imposed from the outside (which of course can fit more or less well, and a person can adopt to any extent for themselves or not at all). If there are other more internal ways that gender works, I can’t imagine them at the moment. But I’d be happy to learn more. The reason for this blind spot is probably also the reason that I didn’t think to be clear about sex and gender in the original post. My gender is about as essential to my identity as my eye color: it’s a concept that other people find useful, that hurts me only when combined with sexism, and that I think about only when other people make it an issue (for better or worse). (There are surely both biological and cultural reasons for this ;D). Being trans doesn’t seem worse or less natural to me than being cis, but neither really make intuitive sense to me–nor does any way of identifying strongly with any gender. So, being gender-indifferent, it’s possible that I’ve missed less-obvious ways that gender can interact with ADHD. If so, it would be helpful to hear about it!  Thanks again for taking the time to share your thoughts, in such a clear and respectful way!  (AUTO POST)" False text

If Earth were the size of a nickel, Jupiter would be about as big as a basketball. 2. Fifth in Line Jupiter orbits our sun, and is the fifth planet from the sun at a distance of about 484 million miles (778 million km) or 5.2 Astronomical Units (AU). Earth is one AU from the sun. 3. Short Day / Long Year  One day on Jupiter takes about 10 hours (the time it takes for Jupiter to rotate or spin once). Jupiter makes a complete orbit around the sun (a year in Jovian time) in about 12 Earth years (4,333 Earth days). 4. What’s Inside?  Jupiter is a gas-giant planet without a solid surface. However, the planet may have a solid, inner core about the size of Earth. 5. Atmosphere  Jupiter’s atmosphere is made up mostly of hydrogen (H2) and helium (He). 6. Many Moons  Jupiter has 53 known moons, with an additional 14 moons awaiting confirmation of their discovery — a total of 67 moons. 7. Ringed World  All four giant planets in our solar system have ring systems and Jupiter is no exception. Its faint ring system was discovered in 1979 by the Voyager 1 mission.  8. Exploring Jupiter:  Many missions have visited Jupiter and its system of moons. The Juno spacecraft is currently orbiting Jupiter. 9. Ingredients for Life?  Jupiter cannot support life as we know it. However, some of Jupiter’s moons have oceans underneath their crusts that might support life. 10. Did You Know?

 It was $50,000 IN A LIFETIME!  So yes, I WOULD have a HUGE problem.  As far as preexisiting conditions go SWITCH A JOB!   Before the ACA when you switched a job there was a period where they would not cover preexisting conditions.  I know, many of you have forgotten that!  Also, try and afford COBRA if you have been laid off, YAH RIGHT.  COBRA is the biggest lie!  When I got laid off from Inventive Communications the COBRA insurance was about 75% of the amount I was getting for unemployment while looking for a job.  I could not afford that and eat, have housing, or use any form of transportation to even find a job, so I HAD to go without and don’t give me your BULLSHIT about I had a choice, the only choice is your choice to hate others.  I had to go to free clinics for health care, clinics where I was treated like the worst in society.  Any of you that went through CMHC know what I mean.  Clinics where the staff would yell at you and call you names.  Clinics that were little more than revolving doors.  I hate to see what it would be like now, now that I came out as Transgender and most free services are religious based and in the current climate of hatred this means like most I would either have to detransition or go without.  But in the end most likely the only way I would get medications is Planned Parenthood for my HRT (thank G-d they are around) and the ER or Crisis Center for my mental health.I do not write this for your sympathy, I appriciate the thoughts but do not need them posted on here.  No, I wrote this to show how harmful Trumpcare and overall the Republicans HATE FILLED BIGOTED MYSOGINISTIC ABLEIST view of health care and society is.We need medicare FOR ALL.  We need a system where people no longer fall through the cracks.  We need a system not run by money grubbing companies that only care about profits.  It is fine if you want to buy extra insurance, that is ok, but we need a base healthcare system that covers EVERYONE, not just the privileged, and yes having health insurance means you have a PRIVILEGE.  I know, everyone thinks that universal health care is the worst system ever, I mean look at England, Canada, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Germany, Austria, Spain, Italy, Iceland, Ireland, Switzerland, Sweden, even Australia who Trump praised, they all have universal health care systems.  Look at all the countries without universal health care, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, India, China, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, most of Africa, a majority of South America.  Looking at these lists we can see what type of health care systems provide better health care.  One final note, stop claiming to be prolife if you don’t want to provide a way for people to get the health care they need.  You are not prolife, you lie, you are probirth.  And no, you do not qualify as a good samaritan either, even if your church provides “free” health care.  Religious provided healthcare is still judgmental and they do not provide the same level to those that are different.  No, you are nothing more than the priest or levite, walking on the other side of the road, someone who would only come to aid one of their own, more worried about your money and making sure you have enough to give your EXACT 10% tithe, but never wanting to truly help your fellow human who might be different from you, not wanting to get your hands dirty.  " True text

ariannabotaku 161063505326 "2017-05-25 17:40:34 GMT" https://ariannabotaku.tumblr.com/post/161063505326/asan-statement-on-presidential-budget "autisticadvocacy:  ASAN strongly condemns the deep cuts  that the President’s proposed budget would make to Medicaid, Social  Security, and other critical programs for people with disabilities. The  President’s proposal would deprive countless Americans with disabilities  of critical health care and community-based supports. It would jeopardize our very lives and result in a massive return to nursing homes and institutions.  ASAN calls on Congress to reject these devastating cuts and craft a  budget that invests in people with disabilities, our families, and our  communities. We have come too far to go back. The President’s budget would require  massive cuts to Medicaid, which acts as a lifeline for countless people  with disabilities. Medicaid is not only a critical source of health care  coverage but also the main funder for home and community-based services  and supports that help us live in the community instead of  institutions. But the President’s budget takes the $800 billion in  Medicare cuts proposed by the American Health Care Act and adds an extra $610 billion in additional cuts. This will reduce Medicaid funding by more than a trillion dollars over the next 10 years – a change that would cut the program in half.   This budget would eliminate $47 million for research on health care and services for autistic people and our families  that was provided via the Autism CARES Act. These services include the  Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental and Other Related  Disabilities (LEND) and Developmental Behavioral Pediatrics (DBP)  programs which train healthcare professionals to work with autistic  people. These cuts are in addition to $5.8 billion in cuts to the  National Institutes of Health and $35 million in cuts to CDC work  related to autism and developmental disability. The budget would also cut Social Security at the same time that it cuts programs that help us find jobs in the community. It promises $50 billion in cuts to Social Security Disability.  The only way to achieve such stark cuts is to kick people with  disabilities off the program, through punitive and impossible-to-meet  work requirements or other harsh changes which will result in people  losing their Social Security. While ASAN has always supported programs  to help people with disabilities find employment, these cuts aren’t  designed to move people to quality jobs that help them escape poverty.  In fact, the budget would also cut all Vocational Rehabilitation funding for state supported employment grants,  which are instrumental in helping people with intellectual and  developmental disabilities get and keep real jobs in the community. Furthermore, it would punish SSI recipients for living together  – including couples and families – by reducing their SSI payments. SSI  programs already force people with disabilities to survive on an average  of just $18 per day. Further cuts would force SSI recipients to choose between separation and starvation. To  make it worse, the President’s budget would also make massive cuts to  programs that are critical to people with disabilities living in  poverty, including a $193 billion cut to the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), or food stamps program, over the next ten years; completely eliminating the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) that helps low-income people pay their heating bills; and a $72 million cut to substance abuse prevention programs. In addition to cuts to our health care and community-based services, our community would see a $25 million cut to programs to build affordable community-based housing for people with disabilities  and a $7.7 billion cut to affordable housing programs overall. These  cuts could cause over 250,000 people to lose the housing vouchers. The  budget would eliminate the National Housing Trust Fund, which helps people with extremely low incomes escape or avoid homelessness. For  thousands of people with disabilities who are already struggling to  make ends meet, these cuts will mean homelessness or imprisonment in an  institution. Finally, this budget would cut  smaller but vital programs that increase inclusion and independence for  people with disabilities and our families. This budget would cut all federal funding for the Special Olympics, would eliminate programs that provide free legal assistance to people with low incomes,  and would sharply reduce funding for State Councils on Developmental  Disabilities, the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living,  and Rehabilitation Research, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health  Services Administration.  People with disabilities’ lives have value and  are worth investing in. We deserve more than this. When Congress threatened to cut Medicaid by over $800 billion, we showed up to fight.  Congress heard from the disability community in town halls, and through  countless phone calls, faxes, and letters. That fight isn’t over–but we  can win, and we can beat these cuts too.  We call on Congress to reject the President’s attack on the supports we  need to live in the community. Our lives are too important to be put on  the chopping block. " False link
