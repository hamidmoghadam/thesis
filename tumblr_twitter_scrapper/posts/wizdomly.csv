We courageously approached each day, determined and fierce on our journey to find that wonderful mystic truth that is Love. But then, we find Love. We find something that we can trust — that which produces affirmation and appreciation and optimism and faith and compassion and peace. It is then, that Fear rushes in to question what we have found, or rather, have been given. How can one determine the length of the infinite using a measuring stick of the finite? Fear not. Love."

To talk health, happiness, and prosperity to every person you meet. To make all your friends feel that there is something in them To look at the sunny side of everything and make your optimism come true. To think only the best, to work only for the best, and to expect only the best. To be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own. To forget the mistakes of the past and press on to the greater achievements of the future. To wear a cheerful countenance at all times and give every living creature you meet a smile. To give so much time to the improvement of yourself that you have no time to criticize others. To be too large for worry, too noble for anger, too strong for fear, and too happy to permit the presence of trouble. To think well of yourself and to proclaim this fact to the world, not in loud words but great deeds. To live in faith that the whole world is on your side so long as you are true to the best that is in you.”  ― Christian D. Larson, Your Forces and How to Use Them" True text

The three fish saw them.The intelligent fish decided at once to leave,to make the long, difficult trip to the ocean.He thought,               “I won’t consult with these two on this.They will only weaken my resolve, because they lovethis place so. They call it home. Their ignorancewill keep them here.”When you’re traveling, ask a traveler for advice,not someone whose lameness keeps him in one place.Muhammad says,               “Love of one’s countryis part of the faith.”                                But don’t take that literally!Your real “country” is where you’re heading,not where you are.Don’t misread that hadith.In the ritual ablutions, according to tradition,there’s a separate prayer for each body part.When you snuff water up your nose to cleanse it,beg for the scent of the spirit. The proper prayer is,“Lord, wash me. My hand has washed this part of me,but my hand can’t wash my spirit.               I can wash this skin,but you must wash me.”A certain man used to say the wrong prayerfor the wrong hole. He’d say the nose-prayerwhen he splashed his behind. Can the odor of heavencome from our rumps? Don’t be humble with fools.Don’t take pride into the presence of a master.It’s right to love your home place, but first ask,“Where is that, really?”The wise fish saw the men and their nets and said,“I’m leaving.”Ali was told a secret doctrine by Muhammadand told not to tell it, so he whispered it downthe mouth of a well. Sometimes there’s no one to talk to>You must just set out on your own.So the intelligent fish made its whole lengtha moving footprint and, like a deer the dogs chase,suffered greatly on its way, but finally made itto the edgeless safety of the sea.The half-intelligent fish thought,               “My guidehas gone. I ought to have gone with him,but I didn’t, and now I’ve lost my chanceto escape.               I wish I’d gone with him.”Don’t regret what’s happened. If it’s in the past,let it go. Don’t even remember it!A certain man caught a bird in a trap.The bird says, “Sir, you have eaten many cows and sheepin your life, and you’re still hungry. The little bitof meat on my bones won’t satisfy you either.If you let me go, I’ll give you three pieces of wisdom.One I’ll say standing on your hand. One on your roof.And one I’ll speak from the limb of that tree.”The man was interested. He freed the bird and let it standon his hand.               “Number One: Do not believe an absurdity,no matter who says it.”The bird flew and lit on the man’s roof. “Number Two:Do not grieve over what is past. It’s over.Never regret what has happened.”“By the way,” the bird continued, “in my body there’s a hugepearl weighing as much as ten copper coins. It was meantto be the inheritance of you and your children,but now you’ve lost it. You could have ownedthe largest pearl in existence, but evidentlyit was not meant to be.”The man started wailing like a woman in childbirth.The bird said: “Didn’t I just say, Don’t grievefor what’s in the past? And also: Don’t believean absurdity? My entire body doesn’t weightas much as ten copper coins. How could I havea pearl that heavy inside me?”The man came to his senses. “All right.Tell me Number Three.”“Yes. You’ve made such good use of the first two!”Don’t give advice to someone who’s groggy and falling asleep. Don’t throw seeds on the sand.Some torn places cannot be patched.Back to the second fish,               the half-intelligent one.He mourns the absence of his guide for a while,and then thinks, “What can I do to save myselfform these men and their nets? Perhaps if pretendto be already dead!               I’ll belly up on the surfaceand float like weeds float, just giving myself totallyto the water. To die before I die, as Muhammadsaid to.”               So he did that.He bobbed up and down, helpless,within arm’s reach of the fishermen.“Look at this! The best and biggest fishis dead.”               One of the men lifted him by the tail,spat on him, and threw him up on the ground.He rolled over and over and slid secretly nearthe water, and then, back in.               Meanwhile,the third fish, the dumb one, was agitatedlyjumping about, trying to escape with his agilityand cleverness.               The net, of course, finally closedaround him, and as he lay in the terriblefrying-pan bed, he thought,               “If I get out of this,I’ll never live again in the limits of a lake.Next time, the ocean! I’ll makethe infinite my home." True text
