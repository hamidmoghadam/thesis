Something I want to clarify here is that Jefferson in the comic isn’t at all having social anxiety but is in fact me draiwng out my reaction to a recent situation from my personal experience. I am scared of presenting mental illness wrongly and that wasn’t my intention to begin with.Anyhow, I have had an experience presenting something in front of a crowd and honestly it shook me to pieces. I wanted this to be a jeffmads post mostly because I want to show my aspect of Jeffmads?The very important idea about the comic is that 1) You can have support in your life in very bad situations2) They often won’t help you completely get rid of your problems/anxiety but their effort can be something that becomes a drive for you to overcome things.Something I REALLY HOPE people understand is that Jefferson didn’t… really recover from whatever he was going through, however he had gotten the motivation to put himself through because he had Madison talking to him and offer him security and support. That is the kind of relationship I seek in Jeffmads. Copying from what I said to hui:“I want him to be older and I want him to realise thie younger person is goign to stick with him and feel comforted that this is it to like not restrict himself so much? maybe idkbut like to acknolwedge that, here this is the person that is goign to pass my stuff on and while I am still alive he’ll be by my side and that comforts me and through accepting this person in this closer vicinity in his life opening slowly up to many more thing as well. a stragiht forward and old, tryign to keep his own way sense of mind is in my head when i think of jefferson alright madison is not THAT YOUNG but he’s got insight and not all of them would be 100% same as jeffersonand to accept that in his carreer and social circle is already an efforthis learning is to essentially discover that this may be a healthy thing for him and to realise that maybe Madison does completely feel fine to be around to stand as something that gives him security from time to time”I think a big aspect of Jeffmads for me is support and obvious the can’t be more obvious platonic relationship between them. I value that a lot and I think that’s what I want to bulid into it IF i EVER Get my own ground to do so.It is important note that Jefferson’s thoughts and physical are both a mess until Madison talks to him, where he tries to calm himself, but his body was still shaking.I really really relate a lot and put a lot of myself into characters sometimes and I hope it isn’t killing the experience.Thanks for the read!"
