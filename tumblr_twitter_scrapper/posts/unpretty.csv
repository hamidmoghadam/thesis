I can nearly guarantee you that most of the REGs who are doing this – who are making these bullshit callouts, who are building these huge smear campaigns – don’t actually believe that there is a “network of advocates for pedophiles” among the inclusionists. But we started no-platforming them. We started ignoring them. For many of us inclusionists, the discourse had died down because we had stopped engaging with exclusionist’s toxic bullshit.  What better way to make noise than to use an accusation that would get people, even people uninvolved with discourse, to spread these massive callouts with misinterpreted receipts? To mass block and harass people? What better way to paint aspecs and inclusionists as abusers than to use a word that makes everyone’s knee-jerk disgust reaction fire? What better way to make themselves relevant again than to make themselves out to be the protectors of children and csa survivors? What better way to force inclusionists to pay attention to them again, than to accuse them of being something they can’t possibly ignore? That they have to combat, or they’ll be painted as Guilty by Silence?  The whole thing falls apart quickly, of course, if you actually read the receipts…but many people won’t do that. And they know that. They know that people won’t want to dive through dozens of posts to see if any of them are true, but that they’ll feel guilty if they don’t reblog it just in case there’s dangerous people up there. But when you look at the discourse. When you look at how REGs have harassed, misgendered, misinterpreted, lied, sent fake screenshots, doctored screenshots, mocked people for their disabilities, mocked people for their triggers, mocked people for the words they’ve chosen to ID with, told people that their abuse didn’t happen the way they remember, told people that their abuse outright didn’t happen, posted porn and suicide baiting in the ace positivity tags, actively tried to erase history to make themselves seem correct, exposed themselves to be biphobes, transphobes, TERFs, and TRUSCUM, harassed people (even minors!) to the point of mental breakdown and even suicide attempts, erased Aspecs of Color, used Autistics as pawns, implied that all inclusionists are “cishet” even though a ton of us are neither cis nor het, implied that aspecs are inherently homophobic for just existing, implied that we’re the reason for other tags being wiped, actively wished violence against us, made us out to be an oppressor class so that we’re “easy” to bully…. The list goes on. But when you see this list, this minuscule example of just what I’ve seen and what I can remember….Those of you who are still uninvolved, I really need you to think. Even if you don’t think aspecs are LGBT+. Even if you don’t think aspecs are marginalized. Even if you actively hate me, or anyone who is currently being smeared. Are these really the kind of people you want to support? Are these the kind of people you want to trust? Can we really look at what they’ve done and think this is no more than just an internet debate?  This isn’t just petty discourse. These accusations could ruin lives. These accusations, these false accusations against many people who have victimized by pedophilia, are not a little joke. This is hurting real people. People who have already been hurt by the very abuse that REGs are claiming they are sympathetic to.  And I know this whole post reads vaguely like propaganda, I know it may seem like I’m making a lot of leaps in judgement by saying that REGs are making these false callouts with the express purpose of slandering inclusionists instead of alerting people to real, dangerous individuals. But I don’t think it’s that much a leap, mostly because of a one fact: A few people, otherwise not involved, have come forward to ask that people not group csa survivors and pedophile apologists…only to find themselves added to the list as a “pedophile apologist”. The very request that people not group victims of pedophilia in with pedophiles is enough to warrant someone being a pedophile apologist. That fact proves that it’s about slander, not safety.  And it’s because of this that I have this request: Please, for the love of god, read the receipts – all of them – on callouts you see. If you have questions, message the people. Ask them for clarification especially if you can search their blog and find that they are queer, trans, or a csa survivor.  There are real pedophiles on this site, but these lists are making it ten times harder to know when accusations are legitimate. My inbox is open, though not to anons. Not about this. I will personally clarify anything having to do with these “receipts” against me, and I’m sure most people on the list would do the same.  …this got really long, so I’m sorry. I’m having a lot of thoughts about this situation. About how in order to defend myself as an aspec, I have to deal with people abusing me this way. About how I want to stop dealing with this but can’t. About what to do. Don’t worry, followers, I have no intention of deleting or anything like that. I just…have to think about how to deal with this in an appropriate and healthy way. Because just making posts and hoping that people will read them and understand, hoping that enough people will call out these REGs making these lists, isn’t working. I’m just a small blogger, and that one list has about 400 notes now – 400 people who probably haven’t read the receipts and are just spreading these lies. It hurts me, personally, but it hurts me for the CSA survivors on the list more. I can’t imagine what it’s like for people who have been abused in such a way to see people claiming they sympathize and even advocate for the people who abused them. And for other people to believe them and spread that lie without even checking their blog. I can’t imagine how that must feel.  And I’m just sorry. I’m so sorry that this is happening. That the same people keep getting abused over and over again because they happened to be vocal about Ace Discourse™.  And I’m tired. I honestly can’t believe that there are people out there who would stoop so low as to paint abuse victims as the abusers, to lie and smear and slander…and pretend like they’re in the right.  End point: Please read the receipts of callouts before you reblog them. Please ask people for clarification if you feel comfortable and safe in doing so. Think critically about who’s posting these lists, who’s on them, and what benefit such accusations may have. Because REGs are using ignorance to actively abuse vulnerable people…so we have to be more vigilant.  " False text

When they were in the front, the passage rate was only 16.67 percent. That’s based on only 60 rides on a single coaster, and Wartinger guards his excitement in the journal article: ‘Preliminary study findings support the anecdotal evidence that a ride on a moderate-intensity roller coaster could benefit some patients with small kidney stones.’” 4. “Some rides are going to be more advantageous for some patients than other rides. So I wouldn’t say that the only ride that helps you pass stones is Big Thunder Mountain. That’s grossly inaccurate.” 5. “His advice for now: If you know you have a stone that’s smaller than five millimeters, riding a series of roller coasters could help you pass that stone before it gets to an obstructive size and either causes debilitating colic or requires a $10,000 procedure to try and break it up. And even once a stone is broken up using shock waves, tiny fragments and “dust” remain that need to be passed. The coaster could help with that, too.” SCIENCE: IT WORKS  Update:  “In all, we used 174 kidney stones of varying shapes, sizes and weights to see if each model worked on the same ride and on two other roller coasters,” Wartinger said. “Big Thunder Mountain was the only one that worked. We tried Space Mountain and Aerosmith’s Rock ‘n’ Roller Coaster and both failed.”Wartinger went on to explain that these other rides are too fast and too violent with a G-force that pins the stone into the kidney and doesn’t allow it to pass.“The ideal coaster is rough and quick with some twists and turns, but no upside down or inverted movements,” he said.

For those who aren’t familiar with Star Wars (all two of you), Yoda is an alien who, when speaking English, uses what seems to be an OSV syntax instead of the traditional SVO syntax. So how do foreign translations of the script handle this? I am particularly interested in what it looks like in non-SVO languages. Are there any translations where Yoda’s incorrect syntax is emulated by using an English-like syntax? Or are other languages’ syntax so free that mistakes in the use of case or verb conjugations must instead be used to emulate Yoda’s “alien” speech?  And some answers so far:    Czech: Free word order. Yoda speaks consistently in SOV. Interestingly enough, putting an object before a verb does sound unusual to most speakers of Czech.   Estonian: Free word order language. Yoda retains the English OSV order. This is grammatical in Estonian, but does make it seem as though Yoda is constantly stressing the object phrase as the main point of his statements. This gives his speech an unusual quality.   French: An SVO language. Yoda speaks in OSV.   German: A SVO or SOV language. Yoda brings the Object to the front (OSV), like in English.   Hungarian: A free word order language. There is nothing unusual about Yoda’s speech.   Italian: An SVO language. Yoda speaks in OSV. Note: OSV is also the syntax used in the Italian of the less-proficient speakers of Italian from the region of Sardinia.   Japanese: An SOV language. Yoda seems to use a more or less correct syntax, with a more archaic vocabulary.   Korean: An SOV language. Nothing is unusual about Yoda’s grammar.   Norwegian: An SVO language. Yoda speaks in OSV.   Romanian: An SVO language. Yoda speaks in OSV. He also places adjectives before the noun instead of after the noun, and uses an archaic form of the future tense.   Spanish: An SVO language. Yoda speaks in OSV.   Turkish: An SOV language. Yoda speaks in OSV. Note: This order is also used in classical Ottoman poetry, so the syntax may have been chosen in order to emphasize Yoda’s wisdom or age.   " False link

Many black jockeys were sabotaged, to the point where, by the early 20th century, they were becoming more of a rarity in the sport. Jimmy Winkfield was the last African-American jockey to win the Kentucky Derby, in 1902, and he ended up going to Europe and making a name for himself in Russia, France and Germany. (cont.)  Former slaves and immediate descendants knew the horses and took care of them, naturally becoming jockeys. Black jockeys were making way too much money and white people wanted in. Black jockeys were drugged and sabotaged, and now there are no more Black jockeys. The older I get, the more amazed I am that these little nuggets of America Ain’t Shit keep crossing my path. Things I never even imagined just weaving themselves into the tapestry of white men doing whatever they could to keep every other group underfoot. " False link

It’s phenomenal. “[…] the complete and inarguable disaster of the Bush administration—a failure of the conservative movement itself, one undeniable even to many consumers of the parallel conservative media—and his abrupt replacement by a black man, caused a national nervous breakdown among the people who’d been told, for many years, that conservatism could not fail, and that all Real Americans agreed with them. Rather rapidly, two things happened: First, Republicans realized they’d radicalized their base to a point where nothing they did in power could satisfy their most fervent constituents. Then—in a much more consequential development—a large portion of the Republican Congressional caucus became people who themselves consume garbage conservative media, and nothing else.”  Reblogging to read later, you had me at “they’d radicalized their base to a point where nothing they did in power could satisfy their most fervent constituents.” " False link

Nicole Chung called it “the only thing you need to read about Dolezal ever again”. I wasn’t familiar with the work of Ijeoma Oluo but I have quickly become a superfan. The dismissive and condescending attitude toward any black people who see blackness differently than she does is woven throughout her comments in our conversation. It is not just our pettiness, it is also our lack of education that is preventing us from getting on Dolezal’s level of racial understanding. She informs me multiple times that black people have rejected her because they simply haven’t learned yet that race is a social construct created by white supremacists, they simply don’t know any better and don’t want to: “I’ve done my research, I think a lot of people, though, haven’t probably read those books and maybe never will.” I might quote this piece all night long.

It’s the utter bane of my existence when people send me their manuscripts to edit, and I get a cover email that read along the lines of “I’m not a fan of romance novels so I added my own twist” and my soul curdles because first of all a) if you don’t like romance but you’re writing it because you’ve realized it’s lucrative and you think Anyone can do it because it’s “easy”: get the Hell out of my genre and b) suffering and misery instead of a happily ever after (or happy for now) are not twists. It’s not edgy, it’s not clever, in fact what it shows me is that you do not understand the genre on a fundamental level and shouldn’t be writing for it. Romance is a fantasy genre, people don’t read fantasy for endless suffering (thank you GRRMartin et al for making every edgelord in the world think nitty gritty detail = pain and suffering without relief and flooding the genre with their shitty reimaginings of the characters from Lord of the Rings but set to the plot of SAW) they read fantasy to know that the suffering  will end. That evil will eventually be defeated, that good things can and will still happen and that the sun will shine again. Romance is no different from that, except it is a genre primarily considered to be feminine and therefore subject to ridicule and the belief that somehow if a woman can do it, it must be easy “But Joy,” I hear some of you say, “Romance doesn’t have that reputation because of sexism, it’s because of how many bad writers get published in it and make it look bad.” *angry buzzer sound* oh I’m sorry that was incorrect, you see every genre has an abundance of shitty books that make it to print, whether it’s goofball sci-fi or Lord of the “all my characters are white because of historical accuracy” Rings 94949392.0 (or if you really want to start a fight, every mediocre white man considered a classic by the literary genre and lauded by academia for writing about wanting to have an affair with one of his students/the inevitability of death) and while they are subject to criticism, there’s still not quite the same vitriol that Romance gets for wanting, what is essentially, a happy life. There is nothing wrong with feel good media, there is nothing wrong with wanting to enjoy something a little bit silly and unapologetically happy. The popularity of coffee shop Aus in fandom is both unsurprising and nothing new. It’s quite literally common romance tropes that have been around forever but with the diversity of fandom (*eyes ao3 tag* kind of) and I will die on this hill defending the validity of Happily Ever Afters and Happily For Now before I let anyone try to take it from my icy cold grip. And if I get one more romance manuscript with a cover letter that says they’ve added a twist, then god dam y'all someone had better have twisted their ankle and been carried bridal style to their bed because I’m so over people hating on the simple want for happiness.  other acceptable twists: polyamory  And polyamory. Things I am now looking for in my romance twists, twisted ankles, polyamory and people doing Chubby Cheker’s The Twist at weddings. That is the acceptable list of twists.  Chocolate twists?  Okay, yes good. Unless your characters have celiac in which case no, I will not allow that kind of suffering. " False link
