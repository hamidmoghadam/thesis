The doctors said it was a miracle I was still alive - I ended up in hospital in the last possible moment. I spent 6 days in the hospital, got my surgery (partial hysterectomy because of big uterine fibroids), went out, and thought it was all over, but of course it wasn’t. Long story short - my employer turned out to be a scammer who wasn’t paying for our insurance for the whole time we worked for him. We’re currently trying to take him to court, but it will take a long time and in the meantime I’m gonna have to pay the entire hospital bill myself. The blood alone (5 units of it) costs 5000 PLN (~$1300), my staying in the hospital is 700 PLN per day, plus the surgery - I have to collect a little less than 20000 PLN (~$5200). I tried to set up a GoFundMe account, but it’s only for Americans and for countries that use euro and Poland isn’t one of them. I set up a Polish crowdfunding website, asking for half of the sum, here. I really hate to ask for your help, but I really, really need it. I’m desperate and terrified. I know that $5200 maybe doesn’t sound that bad, but in Polish currency it’s… it’s really a lot of money. I don’t have this kind of savings, my mom doesn’t have it either - I’m fucked. And all that mess with my job (ex-job) makes me even more terrified. If you can help, please donate some money to my PayPal (echidna.de.rais@gmail.com). I will post a screenshot of my PP savings each day, so you can see how much money there is and how much more I need. Please, help, or at least signal boost this post.

Senators are being flooded with messages opposing the protection of transgender people in Canadian human rights law. Your urgent action is needed to let Senators know that you support Bill C-16 swiftly passing into law.  Submitted by @smugplankton.  witnesses yesterday, in our senate, included high-profile transphobes Meghan Murphy & Paul Dirks, and the biggest twitter-racist trans person Don Plett could find, for some reason[heres a thread] covering the witnesses in today’s senate  https://sencanada.ca/en/senators/ CALL ALL YOUR SENATORS   JORDAN PETERSON?!THAT HORRIBLE FUCKHEAD?HE’S GONNA BE ON THE LAST DAY OF TESTIMONY?!!FUCK!CALL/EMAIL/FAX YOUR SENATORS, HOLY SHIT.   @allthecanadianpolitics  last day of witness testimony is a full Don Plett (the senator blocking  C-16) slate: other notables:- some quebecois terfs  - an old popular Harper-era lawyer, Chipeur, previously notable for being a partner with Ezra Levant at his previous firm, consulted on a multi-million dollar judgement against Omar Khadr, gets called into parliament somewhat regularly for the conservatives to counterpoint against the Canadian Bar Association and Canadian Civil Liberties Association witnesses when there’s a meeting on Justice and Human Rights [for example arguing against funding for human rights court challenges].  I wasn’t able to call senators’ offices because of timing, but I did write the following and send it to Ontario senators. It’s an attempt to position gender identity and expression protections within an old-fashioned Canadian values context of both inclusion and security, given the prevalence of conservative/Conservative viewpoints in the Senate.  Dear Senator:  I understand that Senate hearings for Bill C-16 are nearly over. I’ve had the opportunity this evening to view the list of witnesses that have yet to speak; I suspect that they will make compelling arguments. They may even reference progressive and contemporary sounding concepts such as individual liberty and feminism.  And yet:  I am a woman (a cisgender woman, if it matters), an aunt to two little girls, a feminist, a professional, a proud Canadian and Ontarian, and a believer in both good government and personal liberties. And I can see no reason whatsoever why the Act to Amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code (Bill C-16) should not be passed into law.  Transgender, non-binary, and other gender non-conforming people experience extraordinary levels of discrimination, harassment, and violence. Transgender people have existed across the globe, in all times, places, and cultures. They are a part of the fabric of Canadian society, and they are often much more vulnerable than other Canadians.  There is a radical “feminist” school of thought that suggests that a person’s ability to express a gender identity different than the one assigned to them at birth is regressive, limiting, and dangerous: that it limits women and men to carciactures from generations ago. I’m approaching 40 years old, and I have never seen any evidence of this. I am happy and proud to live in a time when there are a multitude of ways to be a person of any gender identity and with any gender expression, and have never felt that this did anything to impede my ability to be myself. To put it bluntly: a beautiful, impeccably dressed, well made-up and coiffed transgender woman has never made me feel as though I would be somehow not a woman if I chose to wear a pair of jeans.  Many critics of transgender rights also try to create a kind of moral and sexual panic about transgender people​ (particularly women who were assigned male at birth) having access to women’s spaces. I cannot overstate how utterly unafraid I am of someone who was not assigned female at birth being in women’s spaces such as a public bathroom, changeroom, or gym. I am vastly more concerned for the safety and well-being of those people that Bill C-16 aims to protect.  And ultimately, C-16 is a bill about safety. By expanding the prohibited grounds for discrimination under the Human Rights Act and amending the hate speech provisions of the Criminal Code to include gender identity and expression, my country will be a safer place for all Canadians.  Abstract concerns about “gender essentialism” (which themselves betray outdated ideas about what gender is, frankly) and unsubstantiated “bathroom panic” are no threat whatsoever in comparison with the very real, very frightening discrimination, harassment, and violence many Canadians face on a daily basis.  I urge you to consider this when making your decision on this bill, and I urge you to vote to secure the rights and protect the safety of Canadians.   PLEASE, no matter where you’re from, reblog this so that more people can see it!  If you’re Canadian, take action!!!  There are transphobes testifying before the Canadian Senate right now.  And remember: if Amnesty International is saying you’re the bad guy, you’re probably the bad guy. We CANNOT stand by and let people say that hatred is okay. I am a criminologist.  I study crime, focusing on crimes that affect marginalised populations.  In fact, a few months ago I did a project specifically on hate crimes.  So I can say with a great fucking deal of authority here: transgender individuals are at incredibly, incredibly, unfathomably high risk of violence and murder.  Especially trans women, and especially trans women of colour.  This just keeps increasing if they are also members of other marginalised communities (e.g. people with mental illnesses, sex workers,    people with disabilities,  people living in poverty, etc., etc.).  Canada has a duty to protect its citizens, and that fucking includes trans people.  Don’t let them forget that.

Despite his efforts, he was unable to locate even a single relative’s grave.A local man who was walking his dog pointed him to a site in the distance where, the man said, he would find “Jewish graves.” When Bulka got to the site, his heart nearly stopped. The “graves” were pieces of Jewish gravestones that had been used as stones to build the wall around the town’s Christian cemetery. Bulka, a religious man, was furious. “It was a disgrace,” he says.Upon returning from his trip, Bulka, 50, a resident of Sha’arei Tikva, began researching the fate of the Jewish graves markers, discovering that they had been uprooted around 1959, when the Communists ruled. Photos he located with the help of a local blogger document the desecration of the cemetery. Along with photos of the gravestones being uprooted, one can also see that some were incorporated into a playground for local residents.In early 2016, a few months after his first visit to the city, Bulka went back to Ostrowiec to meet the mayor. His first, unequivocal demand was that the gravestones be removed from the wall of the Christian cemetery. “I won’t rest until these markers are safely returned,” he told the mayor.He came to the meeting with a few concrete suggestions. One was to take the misappropriated gravestones and turn them into a memorial, with the help of Israeli teens who would visit the area during their trips to Poland. Another proposal was to send the stones to Israel.“There are a lot of suitable options, just so they don’t remain a wall in a Christian cemetery,” he said. “I tried to explain to the mayor that we see these monuments as holy objects, and as such Jewish law bans them from being used for any other purpose.”After consultations, the mayor agreed to remove the Jewish gravestones from the cemetery wall, on condition that Bulka fund the dismantling of the stones, their transport to another location and the rebuilding of the wall. He demanded half a million zloty, around 460,000 shekels (over $125,000).Bulka was astonished. “Not only do you take my people’s gravestones and use them for disrespectful purpose, you expect me to build you a new wall?” he asked. “There’s no reason for us to fund the construction of a wall for a Christian cemetery.”His frustration grew as all his appeals to organizations, agencies and private individuals who deal with the preservation of Jewish cemeteries refused to help or even answer his inquiries. “Apparently this town isn’t central enough or interesting enough to anyone whose family isn’t buried here,” he says, despairingly.A turning point came when he discovered that there are three properties in the town that are registered in its land registry as belonging to his family. “I have proof that for seven generations my family owned land there,” he says. “Since my whole family was murdered in the Holocaust, my family is the only heir to them.”Bulka hopes that now he has a bargaining chip with which to approach the city. “I will propose to the municipality that I will give up these properties if they give up the gravestones, a kind of barter,” he says.Deep down, however, he knows that Eastern European bureaucracy won’t exactly work in his favor and that while his plan looks logical on paper, it probably won’t lead to the “liberation of the gravestones,” as he puts it, in the near term, especially since until now he’s been working on his own.He is now looking for a person or organization with some resources to pursue his fight. “Every day that passes, the blasphemy there continues,” he says.The city of Ostrowiec Swietokrzyski did not respond to Haaretz’s request for a comment. On Yom HaShoah, it is important to remember that the antisemitism and dehumanization that allowed the Shoah to happen in the first place hasn’t disappeared, has not been cured, has not been addressed, and has not abated.

Traci Kato-Kiriyama: It was stunning visually, but emotionally it didn’t draw me in. Keiko Agena: It was harder to watch than I thought  it was gonna be. To get emotionally invested, you have to really care  that she needs to find out who she is. But when she finally meets her  mom, my gut felt so weird in that moment. Kato-Kiriyama: That scene was devastating on all  levels. It got me because of the emotion of the mother [veteran Japanese  actress Kaori Momoi]. She’s really wonderful. That scene should have  been beautiful, but Major had nothing in her eyes. Acting-wise, what a  missed moment. Atsuko Okatsuka: I wasn’t aware they were gonna  explain the whitewashing. I thought it was just going to be an action  film, no explanation, just go with the fact that it’s a future Japan  with this robot cop. And then to be like, “Oh shit, I used to be a  Japanese woman!” (Laughter) That was against my expectations. How did you feel when that twist was revealed? Agena: That was hard, y’all. Hard and awkward. Ai Yoshihara: Major’s backstory is white people trying to justify the casting. Okatsuka: And they f—ed up in the process because  now it looks even worse. The text at the beginning of the movie  explained that Hanka Robotics is making a being that’s the best of human  and the best of robotics. For some reason, the best stuff they make  happens to be white. Michael Pitt used to be Hideo. Agena: That was the other cringe-worthy moment, when  they called each other by their Japanese names. We’re looking at these  beautiful white bodies saying these Japanese names, and it hurt my heart  a little bit. Kato-Kiriyama: It was supposed to be so touching and intimate, and it felt gross. And kind of laugh-worthy at the same time. Okatsuka: I would have preferred them just using American names. “You used to be Bob.”   When THR interviewed Japanese fans about the whitewashing claims, they weren’t bothered by it, and neither was Mamoru Oshii, who directed the 1995 anime version. How do you feel about their response? Yoshihara: People in Japan worship white people. Kato-Kiriyama: Even in the story, there are Japanese people involved in creating these beings and they also may very well see the ideal human being as a white woman. So you’re sort of messed up all the way around. Agena: Yes! I felt more messed up watching this movie. It reinforced my own personal messed-up standards of physical beauty.

The Senate, after a procedural vote, will now proceed to a measure that would dismiss an Obama-era rule banning states from denying federal funds to such organizations. Pence’s vote was needed for the Senate to agree to bring the resolution to the floor. Republicans Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska broke with their party, voting against the measure. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., called the measure a “shameful, dangerous resolution.” “We are not going to give up,” said Murray, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. “We are going to keep making sure that women’s voices are heard.” Since 2011, 13 states have restricted access to such grants, disrupting or reducing services in several instances.
